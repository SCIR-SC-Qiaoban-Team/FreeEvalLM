    {'index': 0, 'turns': ['"Mike Hughes, a 61-year-old self-proclaimed daredevil, is set to launch a homemade steam-powered rocket in California this weekend, in a bid to prove that the Earth is flat. The rocket, which has cost Hughes $20,000 to build, will reach an altitude of 1,800ft and will be livestreamed over the internet.\n\n* Hughes has a history of taking risks, having twice broken his back doing stunt jumps in cars, and has now turned his attention to rocketry. He claims to have a deep understanding of aerodynamics and fluid dynamics, but rejects the concept of science as a whole. "I don\'t believe in science,
        " he declared. "I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air. But that\'s not science, that\'s just a formula."\n* The rocket will be launched from the back of a converted motorhome purchased from Craigslist, and is sponsored by a flat Earth research group. Hughes plans to use the launch as a stepping stone to further prove his theory, and has stated that he intends to observe the flatness of the Earth for himself on a subsequent trip.\n* Despite the risks involved, Hughes is undeterred, saying "It\'s scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive." He has previously flown in his own rocket in 2014, and has described himself as "the only man to design, build and launch himself in a rocket".\n* After the launch, Hughes plans to announce that he is running for the governorship of California. ***']}], 'tstamp': 1740555790.8664694, 'total_output_tokens': 320}
