            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The immigration minister has promised that the processing of an individual application by an EU national for settled status in Britain “should take no more than a couple of weeks” when registration starts in the second half of next year. The minister, Brandon Lewis, told the Commons home affairs select committee that an extra 1,200 UK visas and immigration staff were being recruited to process an expected 3.5m applications from EU nationals over two and a half years. He also told MPs on Tuesday that he was optimistic that an agreement could be struck by Christmas on the rights of EU citizens in the UK in the Brexit negotiations. However, he declined to comment on reports that the Brexit inner cabinet had decided on Monday that the European court of justice could continue to play a role in guaranteeing their rights during a two-year transition period. The Home Office minister did confirm that those refused “settled status” and classed as non-EU nationals in Britain illegally could have their bank accounts frozen and face deportation before the hearing of any appeal in British courts. The 3million group, representing EU nationals in Britain, immediately questioned Lewis’s claim that an agreement with the EU on “settled status” was likely before Christmas. “We wonder how. Major stumbling blocks still in place,” they tweeted, noting continued differences over the role of the ECJ, over family reunification rights that could affect thousands, and regarding clarification that they should not face “hostile environment measures”. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, voiced scepticism that an extra 1,200 staff – of whom 700 had already been recruited – would be sufficient when the UK Visas and Immigration agency (UKVI) currently used 6,500 staff to process 3m visa applications a year. There was already a three-month delay in processing EU nationals’ applications for permanent residence documents, she said.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Shot mostly on camera phones by the actors, #Starvecrow is a tiny-budget British drama about a group of insufferably privileged twentysomething mates. Ben Willens is Ben, a controlling narcissist who creepily films everything on his phone. When his on-off girlfriend (Ashlie Walker) walks out for good, he steals her friends’ mobiles – giving the film its footage of attention-seeking drunken antics and nastier behaviour never intended for Snapchat. Ben, like one of the lads from Made in Chelsea after inadvertently catching an episode of The Moral Maze on Radio 4, tells his psychotherapist that he wants to see “between the cracks” of people’s lives. The whole thing is an endurance test of amateurish improv and muddled plotting, with some pseudo-arty cutaways thrown in. No doubt the film-makers are sincere in wanting to say something about the digital age, toxic masculinity and the harmful impact of hypersexualising young women. But #Starvecrow left me feeling bored and annoyed.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Shot mostly on camera phones by the actors, #Starvecrow is a tiny-budget British drama about a group of insufferably privileged twentysomething mates. Ben Willens is Ben, a controlling narcissist who creepily films everything on his phone. When his on-off girlfriend (Ashlie Walker) walks out for good, he steals her friends’ mobiles – giving the film its footage of attention-seeking drunken antics and nastier behaviour never intended for Snapchat. Ben, like one of the lads from Made in Chelsea after inadvertently catching an episode of The Moral Maze on Radio 4, tells his psychotherapist that he wants to see “between the cracks” of people’s lives. The whole thing is an endurance test of amateurish improv and muddled plotting, with some pseudo-arty cutaways thrown in. No doubt the film-makers are sincere in wanting to say something about the digital age, toxic masculinity and the harmful impact of hypersexualising young women. But #Starvecrow left me feeling bored and annoyed.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky has died aged 55. The news was announced on his Facebook page: “On behalf of the Hvorostovsky family, it is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Dmitri Hvorostovsky – beloved operatic baritone, husband, father, son, and friend – at age 55. After a two-and-a-half-year battle with brain cancer, he died peacefully this morning, November 22, surrounded by family near his home in London, UK. May the warmth of his voice and his spirit always be with us.” Hvorostovsky was born in a tough industrial city in Siberia, telling an interviewer in 2002 that as a high school student, prison looked a more likely destination than the opera stage, with “drinking, drugs and fighting,” part of his adolescence. A teenage obsession with pop music also almost claimed the singer for a different world, and his hard drinking and wild behaviour continued into his 20s and early 30s. He came to international attention in 1989 when he beat Bryn Terfel to win the Cardiff Singer of the World title. With his prematurely white hair, dashing good looks and powerful stage presence, his heartthrob image was carefully cultivated and he amassed legions of fans. A career performing in all the major opera houses and concert halls followed, and he was hailed one of the world’s greatest baritones for the rich, expressive fluidity of his voice. His fame allowed him to bring the neglected and little known Russian song repertoire into western halls, most notably with the remarkable accompanist Ivari Ilja. In the opera house he was particularly feted for his performances of Verdi, and also his charismatic and provocative interpretation of Tchaikovksy’s antihero Eugene Onegin, a role he made his own.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Humphrey Bogart’s world-weariness and romanticism take on something brutal and misogynist in this 1950 noir masterpiece directed by Nicholas Ray – and it’s a marvellous performance by Gloria Grahame. This national rerelease is linked to the Grahame retrospective at BFI Southbank, in London. It is adapted from the hardboiled thriller by Dorothy B Hughes, changing her story and rehabilitating the male lead in one way, but in another, introducing a new strain of pessimism and defeat. Bogart is Dixon Steele, a boozy, depressive Hollywood screenwriter whose tendency to violence and self-hatred isn’t helped by the fact that he hasn’t had a hit in years. Like the directors, producers and actors he occasionally sees in bars, his best days were before the second world war. One night at a restaurant, his agent offers him a much-needed gig adapting some brainless bestseller and Dix shruggingly accepts. The wide-eyed hatcheck girl, Mildred (Martha Stewart), tells him she loves the book and, amused, Dix invites her back to his place to tell him what it’s all about. Having established his intentions are gentlemanly, Mildred agrees. Whatever Dix’s intentions may actually have been, they are blown out of the water when the pair of them run into his new neighbour as he is about to show Mildred across the threshold – on her way back to her own apartment. This is Laurel (Grahame), who is wryly amused by what she clearly sees as Dix’s clumsy, predatory designs on this poor girl.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

This national rerelease is linked to the Grahame retrospective at BFI Southbank, in London. It is adapted from the hardboiled thriller by Dorothy B Hughes, changing her story and rehabilitating the male lead in one way, but in another, introducing a new strain of pessimism and defeat. Bogart is Dixon Steele, a boozy, depressive Hollywood screenwriter whose tendency to violence and self-hatred isn’t helped by the fact that he hasn’t had a hit in years. Like the directors, producers and actors he occasionally sees in bars, his best days were before the second world war. One night at a restaurant, his agent offers him a much-needed gig adapting some brainless bestseller and Dix shruggingly accepts. The wide-eyed hatcheck girl, Mildred (Martha Stewart), tells him she loves the book and, amused, Dix invites her back to his place to tell him what it’s all about. Having established his intentions are gentlemanly, Mildred agrees. Whatever Dix’s intentions may actually have been, they are blown out of the water when the pair of them run into his new neighbour as he is about to show Mildred across the threshold – on her way back to her own apartment. This is Laurel (Grahame), who is wryly amused by what she clearly sees as Dix’s clumsy, predatory designs on this poor girl.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Philip Hammond must borrow an extra £90bn over the next five years after the Treasury’s independent forecaster downgraded productivity growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that the chancellor faced a long period of lower than expected wages growth that would dent tax receipts and push up borrowing. The cumulative effect over the life of the parliament would add £90.5bn to the UK’s debt pile and jeopardise Hammond’s target of balancing the government’s books by 2025, it said. The Treasury said that once the positive effects of an increase in employment and better than expected borrowing over the last year are taken into account, the net borrowing rise would be £35bn, putting the chancellor in a position to reach his target of creating a surplus in the middle of the next decade. But some analysts said the OBR’s revision failed to go far enough and it continued to overestimate the capacity of British businesses to invest in new equipment and processes to drive up productivity. They argued that the forecaster should have gone further and predicted that productivity growth – which measures the average output per hour worked – of almost zero over the last seven years would continue for another five years. Joanna Davies, a UK economist at Fathom Consulting, said the OBR’s new forecast that productivity would increase at a rate of 1.1% until 2022 – almost half the 2.1% average seen in the 30 years before 2007 – still looked ambitious. She said the prospects for GDP growth would suffer a severe knock-on effect from lower productivity and a rapidly ageing population. “Over the last five years, productivity growth has averaged just 0.3%,” she said. “Combined with UN projections for working-age population growth, the UK’s trend rate of overall economic growth is probably somewhere in the range 0.5%-1% – around half the 1.5% assumed by the OBR.” The OBR chair, Robert Chote, said GDP growth would not only be hit by lower productivity, but also a weaker than expected export sector that would fail to benefit significantly from the lower pound.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n MPs have been forced to deny that a Commons vote last week means animals are not recognised in the UK as sentient life forms. An amendment to the European Union (withdrawal bill to transfer the EU protocol on animal sentience into UK law was defeated by 313 votes to 295 on 15 November, and since then a row has developed as to what the vote meant in practice. Describing some of the reporting on the vote as “weird and dishonest”, Tory MP Zac Goldsmith tweeted a clarification that the vote had been about the correct legal procedure for ensuring animal welfare standards – not on the principle of whether animals are sentient. Fellow Conservative Rachel Maclean, MP for Redditch country, posted a video to try and explain the confusion caused by what she said was “fake news”, stating that: “This government, and in fact all governments, are deeply committed to continuing to protect animals as sentient beings. That law is already written into our own law.” Theresa May said at Wednesday’s PMQs: “We recognise and respect that animals are sentient beings, and should be treated accordingly.” Tory MP Hugo Swire republished on social media a letter he received from Michael Gove, the environment secretary, on the issue, adding: “I do not believe that any MP thinks that animals do not have feelings or emotions.” Nevertheless, the vote has triggered protests from animal rights groups, including multiple online petitions aimed at the House of Lords, UK parliament and Gove. Public figures including the presenter Sue Perkins have voiced strong criticism of MPs over the issue. Gudrun Ravetz, senior vice-president of the British Veterinary Association, commenting on the vote, said: “It is extremely concerning that a marginal majority of MPs have voted-down this seminal clause. This action undermines the government’s previous promises that the UK will continue to be known for our high standards of animal health and welfare post-Brexit.” However, Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley, pointed out that EU law still allowed many practices across Europe that animal rights groups oppose. The amendment, proposed by the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas, among others, had set out to specifically incorporate article 13 of title II of the Lisbon treaty into UK law. During debate on the amendment last Wednesday, Lucas pointed out that the origins of the clause began with the 1997 UK presidency of the EU and that from 1999 EU law had explicitly recognised that animals were sentient life forms.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

You’ll find everything from grand ensembles to intimate solo confessionals, and this recording is best suited to the latter. That’s because conductor Pablo Heras-Casado has a tendency to over-shape the bigger stuff, to traffic-control the corners and smooth out the ride. With Monteverdi, we need the rough and the spontaneous. But individual musicians and singers of the Balthasar Neumann are wonderful, and they shine in their nimble duos and trios – try the piercingly delivered Salve Regina from sopranos Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

You’ll find everything from grand ensembles to intimate solo confessionals, and this recording is best suited to the latter. That’s because conductor Pablo Heras-Casado has a tendency to over-shape the bigger stuff, to traffic-control the corners and smooth out the ride. With Monteverdi, we need the rough and the spontaneous. But individual musicians and singers of the Balthasar Neumann are wonderful, and they shine in their nimble duos and trios – try the piercingly delivered Salve Regina from sopranos Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Now, Accomable’s team and listings will be merged with Airbnb’s. In the coming months, the listings will be made available via the Airbnb site, and the team says it will now work towards improving the overall Airbnb experience for disabled travellers. Airbnb is also developing an “accessibility needs” checklist that allows hosts to be more descriptive about their home.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Brahms chose the text of his great German Requiem consciously in the vernacular of his country, so those who first introduced it to London decided to pay homage to his ideals and perform it in English, with Brahms’s own piano (four hands) accompaniment.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Google has confirmed it has been able to track the location of Android users via the addresses of local mobile phone masts, even when location services were turned off and the sim cards removed to protect privacy. Revealed by a report by Quartz, Google’s Android system, which handles messaging services to ensure delivery of push notifications, began requesting the unique addresses of mobile phone masts (called Cell ID) at the beginning of 2017. The information was captured by the phone and routinely sent to Google by any modern Android device, even when location services were turned off and the sim card was removed. As a result Google could in theory track the location of the Android device and therefore the user, despite a reasonable expectation of privacy. A Google spokesperson said: “In January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery. “However, we never incorporated Cell ID into our network sync system, so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated it to no longer request Cell ID.” Google requested the Cell ID alongside what is called the mobile country code and mobile network code, which identify the country and mobile phone operator that the smartphone is using. That data is used to ensure the phone stays properly connected to Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging system, which handles the delivery of messages and notifications to the smartphone. A persistent connection is required for the system to work, but instead of staying constantly connected, the phone pings Google’s servers at set intervals. The more pings, the greater the battery drain, so the data collected about the country and mobile networks is used to work out the the minimum number of pings required to stay connected without draining the battery – so called heartbeat analysis. The benefit of having the address of the mobile phone mast to ensure message service reliability is not clear, but through a process of triangulation – the same used to assist when a user is actively using location services – the position of the user can be revealed down to a roughly 400m radius at a minimum, and often much more accurately in urban areas.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has become embroiled in a bizarre Twitter row with the comedy actor Ralf Little over the state of NHS mental healthcare. The standoff began two weeks ago after Hunt’s appearance on The Andrew Marr Show, when Hunt stated that the NHS had overseen “the biggest expansion of mental health provision in Europe”. Little, best known for his role as Anthony in the sitcom The Royle Family, accused the health secretary in a tweet of “knowingly lying” to the public about statistics and told Hunt to sue him if he was wrong. Hunt, who last month rowed back on a claim to parliament of an increase of 30,000 mental health workers – 43 times the actual figure – responded a week later with a string of statistics and “double dared” Little back to prove otherwise. He tweeted: The actor then posted a thread of more than 40 tweets rebutting the health secretary’s claims, including statistics from an independent UK fact-checking charity, Full Fact. That thread has been shared more than 15,000 times. The argument has since rolled on. Hunt on Monday replied with a series of 26 tweets of his own (although losing the chronology in the middle of the thread, making it difficult to follow). “Now I know you are a funny bloke and in politics a lot of insults are traded but the question is can you back up what is a very strong claim?” he asked Little, referring back to his “lying to the public” comment. “To fill the gap [in mental health staffing levels] we now have 8,000 MH nurses in training and have this Sept announced an increase in nurse training places overall by 25%.” Hunt also quoted from a New York Times article from July, which has been corrected three times after the former shadow minister for mental health, Luciana Berger, challenged its contents.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

No one involved in this encounter could be certain of its outcome; neither side could be sure of avoiding humiliation, and thus everyone had a vested interest in keeping it light. Up to a point. But only one side was facing jokiness as a weapon, the same weapon of boorish condescension and toxic bantz that they faced outside the sporting arena every day of their lives. The movie displays the same gracious good humour as its heroine. In 1973, King was enraged by the fact that female players on the grand slam circuit were paid a tiny fraction of what the men got, despite pulling in the same number of paying customers.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Science is littered with tales of visionaries who paid for pioneering research to prove their theories, and this weekend “Mad” Mike Hughes is hoping to join them. He plans to launch a homemade rocket in California as part of a bid to eventually prove that the Earth is flat. Hughes has spent $20,000 (£15,000) building the steam-powered rocket in his spare time, and will be livestreaming the launch over the internet. The self-described daredevil says he switched his focus to rockets after twice breaking his back doing stunt jumps in cars. “I don’t believe in science,” declared the 61-year-old. “I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air. But that’s not science, that’s just a formula.” The rocket, which Hughes aims to reach an altitude of 1,800ft (550 metres) over California, will be launched from the back of a converted motorhome purchased from Craigslist. It is sponsored by a flat Earth research group, and Hughes plans a subsequent trip to try and observe the flatness of the Earth for himself. Speaking about the risks of the flight, Hughes said: “It’s scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive.” Hughes’ website describes him as “the only man to design, build and launch himself in a rocket” – he previously flew in his own rocket in 2014, as this footage shows. Hughes has stated that once he lands at the weekend, he intends to announce that he is running for the governorship of California.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

He plans to launch a homemade rocket in California as part of a bid to eventually prove that the Earth is flat. Hughes has spent $20,000 (£15,000) building the steam-powered rocket in his spare time, and will be livestreaming the launch over the internet. The self-described daredevil says he switched his focus to rockets after twice breaking his back doing stunt jumps in cars. “I don’t believe in science,” declared the 61-year-old. “I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air. But that’s not science, that’s just a formula.” The rocket, which Hughes aims to reach an altitude of 1,800ft (550 metres) over California, will be launched from the back of a converted motorhome purchased from Craigslist. It is sponsored by a flat Earth research group, and Hughes plans a subsequent trip to try and observe the flatness of the Earth for himself. Speaking about the risks of the flight, Hughes said: “It’s scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive.” Hughes’ website describes him as “the only man to design, build and launch himself in a rocket” – he previously flew in his own rocket in 2014, as this footage shows. Hughes has stated that once he lands at the weekend, he intends to announce that he is running for the governorship of California.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Surging levels of violence at an “unsafe” G4S-run youth jail have put staff in hospital and caused inmates to carry improvised weapons for their safety, inspectors have revealed. The damning inspection report into Oakhill secure training centre, near Milton Keynes, was published on Tuesday as MPs heard that ministers had ordered G4S to set up an external inquiry into abuse allegations at Brook House, the immigration removal centre at Gatwick, which is also run by the private security firm. The joint report by the prison inspectors, with Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission, into Oakhill in September and October – when the centre was near capacity, with 75 boys aged 14 to 17 – finds “no evidence that staff can adequately care and control this volume of young people”. The report rates the youth prison as “inadequate” and says there has been an increase in fights and assaults since the last inspection in January; it records 330 assaults between March and August this year alone, with assaults against staff increasing, including against newly recruited staff, and some so serious they have led to people being taken to hospital. “One manager said that young people are carrying improvised weapons because they do not feel safe. This inhibits some staff from intervening because of the fear of a weapon, and this in turn reinforces the view of young people that staff cannot protect them, thereby continuing the cycle,” the report says. The inspectors say that many of the recommendations from their January inspection have not been met and the centre has deteriorated in most respects, including to do with safety, care, education, resettlement and the “effectiveness of leaders and managers”. They say that unacceptable behaviour, including swearing, intimidation and vandalism, is not being challenged by staff. Oakhill’s newly appointed interim director, Lisette Saunders, said: “We take these findings very seriously. In the report Ofsted recognised that senior managers at Oakhill know what is required to bring the centre up to acceptable standards.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The actor and Oscar-winning director, who has faced repeated damaging allegations of racist and misogynistic behaviour, said: “Things got shaken up a little bit and there is a lot of light being thrown into places where there were shadows and that is kind of healthy. It’s painful, but I think pain is a precursor to change.” Gibson was speaking while promoting his latest film, Daddy’s Home 2, his first family comedy in more than a decade after he was convicted of driving under the influence. He pleaded no contest to a misdemeanour battery charge in 2011 against his former girlfriend and mother of his child, Oksana Grigorieva. In 2010, it was reported that tapes had been submitted to the courts of Gibson allegedly using racist language and threatening to kill Grigorieva. He is also alleged to have said she deserved a beating. In one of the most notorious incidents involving the actor and director, Gibson unleashed an antisemitic rant in 2006 against a police officer in Malibu, California, who had pulled him over for drunk driving. He accused Jews of being responsible for “all the wars in the world”. He was convicted of driving under the influence.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theresa May would need to secure a clear Brexit transition agreement by March if she wanted to avoid a “snowballing” number of companies activating contingency plans and even moving operations out of the UK, the Institute of Directors will warn. Stephen Martin, director general of the business group, is to issue the ultimatum to the government at the IoD annual dinner on Tuesday, saying “all we want for Christmas is progress on Brexit”.

Martin will say that businesses do not want to move to World Trade Organisation rules as it would be a “huge drop down from where we are now” but may soon have to start planning for that possibility. “WTO is not the simple option, it would involve massive complexity to adjust our customs procedures, and we would lose not just our level of access to the single market, but also potentially all of the trade and investment agreements we have with other countries through the EU,” he will say. “It’s not desirable, but it is possible.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

In March he was cheered by his backbenchers after the UK avoided the recession predicted by many analysts following the Brexit vote last year. Employment was climbing and measures of consumer and business confidence, which plummeted after the referendum, had bounced back. But he was soon in deep trouble with his Tory colleagues for planning a one percentage point increase in national insurance on the self-employed and, in a humiliating U-turn, he was forced to ditch the whole idea. The election in June left Hammond further weakened. He needs to push through measures that improve the economy’s productivity to have any chance of meeting his pledge to eliminate the UK’s deficit by the mid-2020s, but is also facing pressing problems in public services, welfare provision and a housing market that has effectively locked a generation of young people out of home ownership. Economy What we know: The UK economy expanded by 1.7% in 2016 but registered just 0.5% growth in the first half of this year. The pace has improved since the summer largely due to improving growth rates in Europe and the US, but the outlook remains weak.

The Scottish Labour parliamentary group at Holyrood met to discuss her absence hours after Dugdale arrived in Australia to join 11 other contestants in the reality TV show. In a short statement, the group said it would not take any immediate action against her for flying out without getting formal approval to miss parliamentary sessions and votes. But the statement implied she could yet face some form of sanction. “In accordance with standard procedure, Kezia Dugdale will be interviewed on her return to parliament and have the opportunity to present her account of events,” the statement said. Dugdale’s partner, Jenny Gilruth, has defended her decision to appear on the show, saying she had delayed her arrival to try to avoid a clash with the election of her successor as party leader. Gilruth, a Scottish National party MSP, said those plans were sabotaged by a leak on Friday which meant news of Dugdale’s appearance on the show overshadowed Richard Leonard’s victory in the leadership vote. Gilruth told the Daily Record that Dugdale, a regional list MSP for the Lothians, had tried hard to avoid that happening and was upset by the impact the leak had had on the party, but also by the vitriolic attacks on her judgment. “The news that she was to be taking part was leaked many days before it was supposed to be known,” Gilruth said. “Indeed, she’s not even in there.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The hearing on Wednesday, six years after he was forced from office, follows his success at forging a winning coalition out of his centre-right Forza Italia and two far-right parties – the Northern League and Brothers of Italy – in regional elections in Sicily earlier this month. The outcome of the ballot on the southern Italian island was largely seen as a rehearsal for how things might play out in national elections, which must be held before May next year. It also marked the beginning of an authentic political comeback for the 81-year-old, despite being plagued by a tax fraud conviction, sex scandals and allegations of corruption. Considering the length of time it takes for the court to deliver a verdict, it is unlikely to come before the general elections. The current five-year term for the Italian government officially expires on 15 March, although the vote could be held as late as May. “I hope that the Strasbourg court will accept my appeal,” Berlusconi wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “But my role in the next electoral campaign is clear regardless: I will be in the field looking to take the centre-right into government.” The billionaire, who was forced to resign from his third term as prime minister in 2011 over claims he paid for sex with an underage sex worker, has hired top lawyers from London’s Doughty Street Chambers to fight his case. He was ejected from parliament and banned from running for office for six years in 2013 due to his tax fraud conviction. “We’ll have just 30 minutes to set out our argument, the same goes for the government,” Andrea Saccucci, one of the lawyers who will represent Berlusconi in the Strasbourg court, told the Guardian.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n ‘My motto is: try everything, life is short,” says John Dwyer, the leader of San Francisco garage rockers Thee Oh Sees. “We are growing at every turn. Every day you get a little older, a little closer to the grave – you should taste it all.” A master of contemporary garage rock, he came into prominence as part of the fruitful San Francisco scene of the early 2000s. Since then Thee Oh Sees have rattled out 21 LPs of bewilderingly consistent quality, under various iterations of their name, and Dwyer has written, recorded and released another 20 albums with other collaborators, encompassing everything from industrial electronics to improvised jazz and death metal. In a recent interview with Marc Maron, Dwyer talked of his love of Scott Walker and, in particular, a scene in the Walker documentary 30th Century Man when a percussionist is recorded punching a side of beef; Dwyer has similarly tried to master new sounds, be it a flute on Thee Oh Sees’ Dog Poison or electronic bagpipes on his most recent Damaged Bug LP. His career is full of examples of how to explore genres on a shoestring, too – there are projects that are just drums and vocals (the Drums) or a hefty death metal record squeezed out of three people (Dig That Body Up, It’s Alive). We asked him where to begin in his vast back catalogue. Coachwhips – Bangers vs Fuckers (Narnack, 2003) Coachwhips rewrote the punk aesthetic for the 21st century. Raw, stripped back to the bones of guitar, drums and keys, their shows were chaotic and rambunctious. Bangers vs Fuckers epitomises that, squeezing 11 tracks into 18 minutes, and was notable for Dwyer’s use of a telephone transducer rather than a microphone.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

        "input": "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n ‘My motto is: try everything, life is short,” says John Dwyer, the leader of San Francisco garage rockers Thee Oh Sees. “We are growing at every turn. Every day you get a little older, a little closer to the grave – you should taste it all.” A master of contemporary garage rock, he came into prominence as part of the fruitful San Francisco scene of the early 2000s. Since then Thee Oh Sees have rattled out 21 LPs of bewilderingly consistent quality, under various iterations of their name, and Dwyer has written, recorded and released another 20 albums with other collaborators, encompassing everything from industrial electronics to improvised jazz and death metal. In a recent interview with Marc Maron, Dwyer talked of his love of Scott Walker and, in particular, a scene in the Walker documentary 30th Century Man when a percussionist is recorded punching a side of beef; Dwyer has similarly tried to master new sounds, be it a flute on Thee Oh Sees’ Dog Poison or electronic bagpipes on his most recent Damaged Bug LP. His career is full of examples of how to explore genres on a shoestring, too – there are projects that are just drums and vocals (the Drums) or a hefty death metal record squeezed out of three people (Dig That Body Up, It’s Alive). We asked him where to begin in his vast back catalogue. Coachwhips – Bangers vs Fuckers (Narnack, 2003) Coachwhips rewrote the punk aesthetic for the 21st century. Raw, stripped back to the bones of guitar, drums and keys, their shows were chaotic and rambunctious. Bangers vs Fuckers epitomises that, squeezing 11 tracks into 18 minutes, and was notable for Dwyer’s use of a telephone transducer rather than a microphone.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Poland has been given two weeks to stop illegal deforestation in the Unesco-protected Białowieża forest or face fines of at least €100,000 a day. In a precedent-setting ruling that will echo across the EU, the European court of justice ordered Poland to show it was acting lawfully in the ancient woodland, or face a €36.5m (£32m) annual penalty. Agata Szafraniuk, a lawyer for the green law firm ClientEarth, said that the court was acting after Poland’s environment minister, Jan Szyszko, showed “complete contempt” for an earlier emergency ban on logging in the ancient woodland. “Financial penalties are, unfortunately, an essential tool to ensure that the best-preserved primeval forest in Europe is protected from further harm,” she said. “Trees are still being cut down every day, so the court prescribed this measure to guarantee the full protection of this unique forest, and to avoid irreparable damage.” The court move will ratchet up pressure on Poland, which is already facing a suspension of its EU Council voting rights over a clampdown on the country’s independent press and judiciary. Women’s groups have also been targeted for police raids, and rights to protest have been curtailed, adding to concerns about the rule of law in the east European country. Donald Tusk, the EU Council president, condemned Poland’s nationalist-right Law and Justice party government on Sunday, suggesting it was following the “Kremlin’s plan”. The Polish government maintains that it always behaves lawfully and that logging in Białowieża is necessary to staunch a spruce bark beetle outbreak. “In the western media, everything is based on disinformation,” a Polish government spokesman told the Guardian. “We are doing everything right by law.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The UK, even today, is not well blessed with festivals devoted to new music. But when the Huddersfield contemporary music festival began, in 1978, the situation was much worse, with no annual showcase here for what living composers were producing. That such an event took root in an unprepossessing West Yorkshire industrial town in the late 70s was remarkable in itself, especially when most of the activity in new music then was centred on London. What began on a modest scale under the aegis of Huddersfield Polytechnic (now the University of Huddersfield) – where the festival’s tireless founding director, Richard Steinitz, was a lecturer in music – grew quickly into one of the most important dates in the British musical calendar. The HCMF really hit its stride in the early 80s, hosting a series of important premieres alongside residencies from many of the senior figures of postwar music, from Olivier Messiaen and Terry Riley to Hans Werner Henze and Elliott Carter. Gradually expanding its ambition and range, Steinitz’s programming was never narrowly doctrinal; from the early days, he tried to reflect the spectrum of what was going on across Europe and the US. Steinitz stood down as director after the 2000 festival. The current director, Graham McKenzie, has been there for more than a decade, not only steering the programming towards new generations of composers from across Europe, but also broadening the stylistic scope, including events that touch on jazz, electronica and rock. With these changes, so the atmosphere of the festival has altered. This is partly because the generation of postwar composers whose appearances made the early festivals so memorable has all but gone, but also because, in those days, festival audiences had a sense of a shared purpose.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Concordia International, the Canadian drug company, has overcharged the NHS by more than £100m in the past decade for a life-changing thyroid drug, according to Britain’s competition watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had provisionally found that Concordia had “abused its dominant position to overcharge the NHS” by hiking the price of liothyronine, used to treat patients with an underactive thyroid, by nearly 6,000% between 2007 and 2017. The regulator said the NHS had spent more than £34m on the drug last year, up from about £600,000 in 2006. The amount it paid per pack rose from £4.46 in 2007 to £258.19 by July 2017. The price of a single pill went up from 16p to £9.22, even though production costs remained broadly stable during that period, the CMA said. Concordia could be fined up to 10% of its worldwide annual turnover. Liothyronine tablets are used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition caused by a deficiency of the thyroid hormone that affects at least two in 100 people and can lead to depression, tiredness and weight gain. For many patients there is no alternative and, until this year, Concordia was the only supplier. This summer, the UK firm Morningside Healthcare and Israel’s Teva were granted licences to supply the drug. The medicine, a synthetic version of the hormone T3, is taken by patients who do not respond well to the cheaper alternative, levothyroxine.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Turnbull government has deployed new modelling on the national energy guarantee in an effort to step up pressure on state governments to sign up to its policy at a meeting of energy ministers on Friday. A summary of the modelling, circulated by the government in advance of the talks with the states, suggests household power bills between 2020 and 2030 would be “in the order of” $120 a year lower, in today’s dollars, than under a business-as-usual scenario, if the policy applied across the national electricity market. The material supplied by the government says wholesale electricity prices would be 23% lower than business-as-usual between 2020 and 2030, and it suggests the share of renewables in the market by 2030 “could range from 32% to 36%”. The full modelling, undertaken for the Energy Security Board by Frontier Economics, has not yet been distributed to state energy ministers and the documents circulated in Canberra are a summary of the findings, not the work itself. The Turnbull government announced in October it would dump the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and proceed with the national energy guarantee – a policy that imposes new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020. The policy requires cooperation from the states but some of the Labor governments, particularly South Australia, have been hostile. Part of the reason for that is the states were involved in the exhaustive consultations with Finkel about the clean energy target but were not kept in the loop about the national energy guarantee. Some state governments are also concerned the Turnbull policy will hard-bake coal into the system at the expense of renewables at a time when the energy market needs to transition to low-emissions power sources. A spokesman for the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, is continuing to insist that the state will not commit to sign on to the national energy guarantee in the absence of data showing its specific impact on the state. The Labor states have also commissioned their own work through the Council of Australian Governments energy council examining whether or not they could implement a clean energy target by themselves.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

NT coroner Greg Cavanagh has criticised police for failing to act on an internal report recommending CCTV cameras be installed in caged vehicles in 2013, following an earlier death in custody. In the three years between the two deaths, there were at least 16 attempted suicides in caged vehicles. “In six cases the persons were not detected until they were semi-conscious or unconscious,” Cavanagh found. “It wasn’t a matter of if a person would die in the back of a police van but when.” On 16 September last year, two officers were making their way through Darwin, on their way to investigate a noise complaint, when they came across the scene of a serious crash. A Toyota Hilux had smashed into a palm tree on the corner of the Stuart Highway and Bargot Road, not far from Darwin airport. Hiding behind some vegetation was Dale Scott Walkinshaw, 23. Walkinshaw was unharmed but held his passenger in his arms. The young woman, whom he had met earlier at a bar, was in and out of consciousness, having suffered an injury to her back.

In 1998, the year before she retired, Novotná became only the fifth female player to pass the $10m mark in career prize money and in the same year was within reach of being ranked No 1 in the world. As an athlete she was among the best of her era, possessed of consummate skill in the dying and difficult art of serve-and-volley and an ability to deliver a backhand smash that was the envy of her peers. And yet in her 14 years at the top of the women’s game she won only 24 tour singles titles. Even more disappointingly, she reached the last eight in 22 of the 50 grand slam singles events in which she competed but managed to convert that consistency into just one title. The American player and commentator Pam Shriver, who was a good friend, explained this by saying that Novotná was “as kind as she was athletic”. Others, mostly tennis writers such as myself, put it more brutally: she was a choker. Novotná herself said she hated the idea of choking, preferring instead to say that she “got a little tight”. Her most famous episode of getting a little tight is now a case study for sports psychologists. It came in the 1993 Wimbledon final when she led Steffi Graf 6-7, 6-1, 4-1, and at 40-30 in the sixth game of the deciding set had a service point for a 5-1 lead over the German.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

And yet in her 14 years at the top of the women’s game she won only 24 tour singles titles. Even more disappointingly, she reached the last eight in 22 of the 50 grand slam singles events in which she competed but managed to convert that consistency into just one title. The American player and commentator Pam Shriver, who was a good friend, explained this by saying that Novotná was “as kind as she was athletic”. Others, mostly tennis writers such as myself, put it more brutally: she was a choker. Novotná herself said she hated the idea of choking, preferring instead to say that she “got a little tight”. Her most famous episode of getting a little tight is now a case study for sports psychologists. It came in the 1993 Wimbledon final when she led Steffi Graf 6-7, 6-1, 4-1, and at 40-30 in the sixth game of the deciding set had a service point for a 5-1 lead over the German.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n EasyJet saw its profits fall 17% last year, with more than £100m lost due to the slump in the pound after the Brexit vote. The airline reported a record year for passenger numbers, flying 80.2 million people, almost 10% more than in 2015-16, on ever fuller planes. But while revenues exceeded £5bn in 2016-17, fares dipped to fill seats in what the chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said was “a difficult year for the aviation industry”. McCall said: “Our planned approach of achieving number one or two positions at Europe’s leading airports, friendly and efficient customer service and a continuous focus on sustainable cost control, has put easyJet at a strategic advantage during a period when there have been bankruptcies and some airlines have struggled operationally.” Profits before tax fell from £494m to £408m. Despite paying a lower dollar price for fuel, the continued weakness of sterling brought additional costs of £101m, easyJet said. The airline will also be prompted by Brexit to change its rules to ensure easyJet is majority owned and controlled by EU nationals after 2019. About a third of shares are owned by the easyJet founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who has dual UK-Cypriot nationality, and will be classed as EU-owned. But easyJet will ask at its 2018 AGM for new powers to force UK shareholders to sell up if necessary to allow it to continue operating in Europe. McCall said the move was “a technical, administrative thing” and the airline had “no concerns” about getting enough EU shareholders. Shares rose by more than 5% in early trading, on the back of the airline reporting high levels of forward bookings and better revenue so far in its 2017-18 financial year, which it said was “primarily as a result of some capacity leaving the market”.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.
