            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n It was the frog that pushed me over the edge. I’ve never been a Harry Potter fan myself – I was already out of kids’ books when they first came out, and those clever grown-up covers weren’t enough to tempt me back – but I’d always admired JK Rowling from afar. Who wouldn’t? A writer whose imagination transfixed the world, whose riches now exceed those of the Queen, but who has founded a children’s charity, pays her taxes in full, and remains both poised and politically engaged: as role models go, it is hard to think of a better one. So I was pleased when my seven-year-old son went Harry Potter crazy. Having never read to himself before, he was suddenly racing through book after book, his bedside light on late into the night. His brother and several of his friends caught the bug – just as the Suez canal flowed through Clarissa Eden’s drawing room, Hogwarts overshadowed our house, as children constantly dashed about on broomsticks, casting spells and looking for snitches. It was impressive to see the “Harry Potter effect” in action: the magical power that, in the two decades since its first publication, has revitalised the children’s publishing industry, encouraged millions of children to read, sold more than 400m copies across the world, and generated a cultural empire worth £20bn. Less pleasant, however, was the realisation that there was a marketing juggernaut poised to capitalise on my son’s enthusiasm. Unlike those first readers 20 years ago, the children discovering Harry Potter now are immediately faced with a multibillion-pound industry trading in Potter-themed “experiences” and paraphernalia.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Wage-earning women are also entitled to a maternity leave of 16 weeks, with compensation ranging from €9,29 ($10.94) to €84,90 ($100) per day (according to how much they made before taking leave). As for pregnancy and the weeks around childbirth, finances are no more a problem than outside this period: precarious households are still struggling, but not more than before, and well-off households remain well off. If we look at how supported a mother is, however – well, nothing is planned to help the young mother. Paternity leave lasts only 11 days, which is not even enough for mothers to recover from childbirth. Young mothers must therefore manage the daily, non-stop demands of their new life while they try and heal. They must also seek childcare, knowing that programs proposed by the state are not sufficient, especially in the Paris region. The cost of child care varies greatly. In daycare centers, the less well-off households can get by for €1,000 ($1,177.59) per year – but there is only one place for every eight children.

Featuring the work of high-profile and amateur designers, in campaign billboards, T-shirts and cartoons, it will show graphic design’s power as a tool for political discussion, debate and provocation. • Opens 28 March, Design Museum, London.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Cheyenne Mangold’s hands shook ever so slightly as she reached with a long metal instrument to catch hold of what looked like the cervix. The medical student was attempting, for the very first time, the rudiments of performing an abortion. As she inexpertly brought the pincers together on the soft flesh, you might have expected a little yelp of pain from the patient. There was silence. Not because the “patient” was brave, but because it was a papaya. Mangold was at a special workshop organized by a not-for-profit group whose mission is to make up for the lack of instruction on contraception and abortion at many US medical programs. But it doubled as a lesson in using a no-frills kit of basic instruments that, in the event of the practice becoming illegal in the US, could be stashed and carried discreetly, to perform covert abortions safely. And it so happens that the papaya, with its little fruity neck and a central cavity full of seeds and pulp, is a serviceable approximation of a woman’s cervix and womb for the purposes of basic initiation for a medic in training. Mangold was in a roomful of 60 rookies from across the country. They juggled fruit and tools as they began their journey, come what may, to become the next generation of abortion providers – an increasingly scarce species in some parts of the US.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The medical student was attempting, for the very first time, the rudiments of performing an abortion. As she inexpertly brought the pincers together on the soft flesh, you might have expected a little yelp of pain from the patient. There was silence. Not because the “patient” was brave, but because it was a papaya. Mangold was at a special workshop organized by a not-for-profit group whose mission is to make up for the lack of instruction on contraception and abortion at many US medical programs. But it doubled as a lesson in using a no-frills kit of basic instruments that, in the event of the practice becoming illegal in the US, could be stashed and carried discreetly, to perform covert abortions safely. And it so happens that the papaya, with its little fruity neck and a central cavity full of seeds and pulp, is a serviceable approximation of a woman’s cervix and womb for the purposes of basic initiation for a medic in training. Mangold was in a roomful of 60 rookies from across the country. They juggled fruit and tools as they began their journey, come what may, to become the next generation of abortion providers – an increasingly scarce species in some parts of the US.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

He can guess, though: it doesn’t take a genius. “He might not like what I do, but he has the decency not to say so,” admits the chess-playing, beach football international, former manager of Equatorial Guinea (for one night only) and defender of an aesthetic footballing faith who briefly made Las Palmas the best thing in the league and is now at Real Betis, if maybe not for much longer. “He might go: ‘Bloody hell, this bring-the-ball-out thing, I shit on its mother!’ He’s good enough not to say that, but I’m sure he thinks it.” So is everyone else, and more than before. Because if Simeone never told Setién, on Sunday afternoon he showed him. Really, really showed him.

Talking to the telly, Koke’s opening line couldn’t have been clearer: “Betis were spectacular,” he said. “They played very well, they play very nice football.” Antonio Adán, Betis’s goalkeeper, agreed: “The football we played was incredible,” he insisted, “our opponents were truly dominated.” The problem was, a ‘but’ hung in the air and it was a big one.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Roughly the length of War and Peace, The House of Government aims to capture the rise and fall of Bolshevism through a building and its residents, via a study in eschatology – the creation of an apocalyptic cult, its unexpected success, and its equally unexpected failure. It is a dizzying book, a hall of mirrors, panoramic and bizarre, as puzzlingly esoteric and thrillingly fervent as the doctrines it describes.

Slezkine is best known to non-specialists for The Jewish Century, a lively revisionist history that placed the Soviet Union at the heart of 20th-century Jewish experience, but in the academy he might be better known for his essay The USSR as a Communal Apartment, a pivotal study of Soviet multinationalism through the spatial/architectural metaphor of a crowded, thinly subdivided “kommunalka” flat. The House of Government was another, larger block of flats, completed in 1931, “a place where revolutionaries came home and the revolution came to die”.

The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron’s 2005 efforts to show the Tories cared about global warming. Ahead of this week’s climate change summit in Paris, May said: “There is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.” She described coal as “one of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power” and hailed the “enormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents”. May’s commitment to the issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real. However, the prime minister insists “tackling climate change and mitigating its effects for the world’s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces”. At the summit she will announce a £140m boost to funding for poorer communities affected by climate change through deforestation or vulnerability to natural disasters and extreme weather, plus £15m of additional support for reconstruction on Dominica in the Caribbean, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. It comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being asked by party officials to show off their green credentials after internal polling showed the level of concern among younger voters about environmental issues. The party has been alarmed by the backlash against May’s support for a free vote on foxhunting, the omission of a ban on the ivory trade from the manifesto and its lack of support for an amendment that would have recognised in UK law that animals feel pain. They have since backtracked on all three issues.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  At the end of your response, please explicitly add a postscript starting with P.S."

I tried to get it going again, I really did – I even wore my gym clothes to bed – but nothing worked.

So, could they help me keep my resolution this year? Charles Duhigg, the author of The Power of Habit, certainly thinks so. He tells me there is “a ton of research” to show that New Year resolutions are an effective way to make changes: they create a sense of expectation and ceremony, while the link to a particular day helps to fit our experiences into a narrative of before and after, which makes change more likely. “There are people who will decide on 1 January to lose two stone and who will keep it off for the rest of their lives, others who have been smoking two packs a day for over a decade who will decide to quit and who will still not smoke this time next year,” he says.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The prime minister made a concession on Monday by agreeing to set up a new committee of MPs to monitor any proposed legal changes as EU legislation is converted into the British statute book. She had been facing a parliamentary defeat over the issue during the debate on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday, after a widespread backbench revolt among remain- and leave-supporting MPs. However, the government has not backed down on its intention to fix the day of Brexit as 29 March 2019 or acceded to the demands of soft Brexit Tory MPs who wanted a meaningful vote on the terms of the final deal before that date. One Conservative rebel said May was in trouble over these two issues because there were enough dissatisfied Conservatives combined with Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and other opposition MPs to defeat the government. The MP said the government and the rebels were currently in a standoff with neither side prepared to back down. However, government sources were confident May had managed to convince enough of her backbenchers not to defy the whip by indicating that a vote was likely to happen well before the date of leaving and promising a second vote on legislation implementing the EU withdrawal agreement hammered out in Brussels on Friday. The appetite for rebellion among Conservative MPs will become clearer during the two days of debate and voting on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday and Wednesday. Up to 25 had threatened to revolt unless May promised more scrutiny over Brexit lawmaking, but No 10’s concessions appear to have allayed concerns among the would-be troublemakers. The government will agree to establish a new committee of MPs to help weed out the overuse of “Henry VIII powers”, which allow ministers to make changes to secondary legislation as it is transposed.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

You look around at all the people who are better than you, and get a vivid snapshot of the intense, technical precision, the practice and the perfectionism involved, which is what makes it work for them and not for you. Well, a Zuu class is the opposite of that. You move like an animal, it’s incredibly hard and everybody else covers way more ground, whether as a sideways gorilla or a crawling bear. But no matter how fast they are, how fit, how unruffled or how well-dressed, everybody looks ridiculous. It’s quite elaborate, the Virgin Active I visit: vast and futuristic, a bit like the spaceship in Wall-E, except there is nobody fat there. The instructors are the capital’s finest, sleek, slick, focused: and also, at least while doing a frog squat, ridiculous. The exercise is exactly what it sounds like: very short bursts of traversing a gym floor on your hands and knees. The frog squat starts much like a regular deep squat – think sitting on an imaginary step a few inches off the floor – except you press your elbows against your knees.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

You look around at all the people who are better than you, and get a vivid snapshot of the intense, technical precision, the practice and the perfectionism involved, which is what makes it work for them and not for you. Well, a Zuu class is the opposite of that. You move like an animal, it’s incredibly hard and everybody else covers way more ground, whether as a sideways gorilla or a crawling bear. But no matter how fast they are, how fit, how unruffled or how well-dressed, everybody looks ridiculous. It’s quite elaborate, the Virgin Active I visit: vast and futuristic, a bit like the spaceship in Wall-E, except there is nobody fat there. The instructors are the capital’s finest, sleek, slick, focused: and also, at least while doing a frog squat, ridiculous. The exercise is exactly what it sounds like: very short bursts of traversing a gym floor on your hands and knees. The frog squat starts much like a regular deep squat – think sitting on an imaginary step a few inches off the floor – except you press your elbows against your knees.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The US president refused in October to continue to certify the 2015 multilateral agreement under which Tehran accepted strict curbs on its activities in return for sanctions relief. Trump said that either Congress or US allies should fix the “serious flaws” in the deal, or he would “terminate it. The Senate has since opted out of dealing with the matter, and Washington’s allies have insisted that the 2015 agreement cannot be renegotiated. If Trump refuses to sign a six-monthly presidential waiver due on 15 January, nuclear-related sanctions against Iran will no longer be suspended and the US will be in violation of agreement. The other signatories, including the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China, would then have to decide whether to try to carry on without the US or allow the agreement to collapse. Either way, the Trump administration would have taken a very significant step toward open confrontation.

Football fanatics need not panic: polls show it’s still far ahead of both baseball and basketball in popularity. The 2017 NBA finals averaged 20.4m viewers (a 20-year record), which is roughly the same as the NFL’s regular Sunday night audience of 20.3m, and nowhere near the 2016 Super Bowl über-audience of 111m. Based on just those numbers, football is still kicking professional basketball, baseball and hockey through the goal posts. But America can be fickle. And the Magic 8-Ball of our cultural zeitgeist says, “All signs point to the NBA replacing the NFL as the league of America’s future.” This prediction has nothing to do with the athletes themselves, their level of skill, their heart, or their commitment to their sport. Professional athletes are generally the highest expression of what the human body is capable of doing and therefore inspiring to the fans to reach higher and strive harder. In that way, no sport is superior to any other sport. But when it comes to professional sports, some are more inspirational, more exciting and more entertaining to the general public than others and those sports take on a symbolic meaning for Americans.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The career of Keith Chegwin, who has died aged 60, is characterised by having presented both one of the most popular children’s TV shows in history and a contender for the medium’s most notorious adult entertainment. Viewers saw the best of him in Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (BBC1, 1976-82) and its successor, Saturday Superstore (1982-87), on which Chegwin became an honorary big brother to several generations of goggle-eyed British children, through his cheeky grin and giggle, high-pitched Liverpudlian-accented enthusiasm, and psychedelic knitwear. His presentational worst occurred when Chegwin threw off the novelty sweaters – and, indeed, all clothing except a hat – to front the naturist show Naked (Channel 5, 2000), described by a parliamentarian at the time as the “most disgusting programme ever shown” on British TV. But, while he should be remembered for the work he did with his jolly jumpers on, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for Chegwin, even in his most desperate televisual enterprises. This was due to a natural likability. Only the most sympathetic TV presenters earn nicknames from viewers, and, just as Bruce Forsyth transmuted into “Brucie”, Chegwin rapidly and indelibly became “Cheggers”. That identity was cemented by the title of the third huge success of his children’s career: the music-based gameshow, Cheggers Plays Pop (BBC1, 1978-86), which extended his presenting empire to weekdays. In less prosperous times, though, audiences also admired the impressive and affecting determination with which Cheggers, in the three decades after his Saturday morning career ended, tried to reinvent himself, often against considerable odds. In addition to a common problem for children’s presenters – becoming too old to maintain the required fantasy-sibling dynamic – Chegwin suffered health problems, including alcoholism. Apart from the established presenter-rehab route of reality TV – appearing on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity MasterChef – Chegwin also offered ironic spins on his showbiz rise and fall in 10 projects, including Ricky Gervais’s Extras and Life’s Too Short, and Kill Keith (2011), an improbable comedy-horror Brit film spoof of Tarantino’s Kill Bill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

But, while he should be remembered for the work he did with his jolly jumpers on, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for Chegwin, even in his most desperate televisual enterprises. This was due to a natural likability. Only the most sympathetic TV presenters earn nicknames from viewers, and, just as Bruce Forsyth transmuted into “Brucie”, Chegwin rapidly and indelibly became “Cheggers”. That identity was cemented by the title of the third huge success of his children’s career: the music-based gameshow, Cheggers Plays Pop (BBC1, 1978-86), which extended his presenting empire to weekdays. In less prosperous times, though, audiences also admired the impressive and affecting determination with which Cheggers, in the three decades after his Saturday morning career ended, tried to reinvent himself, often against considerable odds. In addition to a common problem for children’s presenters – becoming too old to maintain the required fantasy-sibling dynamic – Chegwin suffered health problems, including alcoholism. Apart from the established presenter-rehab route of reality TV – appearing on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity MasterChef – Chegwin also offered ironic spins on his showbiz rise and fall in 10 projects, including Ricky Gervais’s Extras and Life’s Too Short, and Kill Keith (2011), an improbable comedy-horror Brit film spoof of Tarantino’s Kill Bill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

I am still not sure whether myself and my children will be landlocked or will be able to live our lives as we did before the vote. I only hope we can continue to plan and have the same aspirations as any other EU citizen in the EU. My children will probably get Dutch citizenship: I think that is a good thing as they would have so many rights and benefits as EU citizens. I have worked so much abroad, and always in a very international environment, though I’m not fluent in Dutch yet. We were thinking of moving near Maastricht in a few years and it was definitely on our radar to move to Germany as I have to cross borders to Germany, Poland and France all the time for my work. Now we don’t know if we can do that. Will I need to get visas? The latest agreement means nothing has changed; we British citizens feel the least cared for group in the negotiations as nobody cares about us – not like the EU cares for EU nationals. ‘We are being ignored’ Ken Wood, 68, retired, has lived in France for four years.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Hard to predict a winner; might Mo Farah finally get the nod? Or Anthony Joshua for his epic defeat of Wladimir Klitschko? Is Adam Peaty high-profile enough to take the award?

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Police investigating a suspected arson attack that killed three people in Salford have arrested four men and a woman. Four fire engines were called to a street in Walkden, Greater Manchester, after the fire broke out at the house at about 5am on Monday. A 14-year-old girl was declared dead at the scene and an eight-year-old boy and seven-year-old girl died in hospital. A three-year-old girl was said to be in a critical condition on Monday afternoon, while a woman, 35, who is understood to be the children’s mother, was in a serious condition. Police are yet to formally identify the victims, but the mother and her 14-year-old daughter have been named locally as Michelle Pearson, 35, and Demi Pearson. Drew Povey, the headteacher at Harrop Fold school in Little Hulton, where Demi was a pupil, said: “We are devastated at the tragic loss of life today in our community. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family involved.” Greater Manchester police said they had arrested three men, aged 23, 20 and 18, and a 20-year-old woman on Monday on suspicion of murder. A 24-year-old man is also being questioned in custody on suspicion of assisting an offender. Police had previously urged a murder suspect to hand himself in, saying there was “an active manhunt” to find an individual who they did not name. “All I would say is he knows who he is and he should give himself up immediately,” said Ch Supt Wayne Miller.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is to launch plans for an opt-out system of organ donation, asking people to overcome their “fatal reluctance” to discuss the issue with family and friends. Under the plans, everybody in England would be presumed to be happy to donate their organs on their death, unless they have signed up to a register stating that they do not want that to happen. In practice, however, it is unlikely that organs would be taken against the wishes of the family. The government’s ambition to change the NHS organ donation programme was announced by Theresa May in her Conservative party conference speech in October. Last year, she said, “500 people died because a suitable organ was not available. And there are 6,500 on the transplant list today.” NHS Blood and Transplant’s figures show that 1,100 families in the UK decided not to allow organ donation because they were unsure, or did not know whether their relatives would have wanted to donate an organ or not. “Every day, three people die for want of a transplant, which is why our historic plans to transform the way organ donation works are so important. We want as many people as possible to have their say as we shape the new opt-out process,” said Hunt. “As well as changing the law, we also need to change the conversation – it can be a difficult subject to broach, but overcoming this fatal reluctance to talk openly about our wishes is key to saving many more lives in the future.” The consultation will ask three questions: how much say should families have in their deceased relative’s decision to donate their organs? When would exemptions to “opt-out” be needed, and what safeguards will be necessary?\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Answer with less than 271 words.

All the illumination is coming from seven strands of lights – one on the tree, six more around the walls; several hundred bulbs. I love them so much that the ones that aren’t on the tree stay up all year. Every year I buy a few more sets, for no good reason – I just find it hard to walk past a shelf of lights without buying a set. I’m not alone in my passion. Although John Lewis won’t give out exact figures, its spokeswoman tells me the chain sells hundreds of thousands of sets of lights each year, its bestseller being an 11m string of 480 white lights in a vine style, yours for 50 quid. People obsess over lights. Search online and you’ll find forums full of people debating bulb types, strand length, how to build their own strands without having to sully themselves with inferior shop lights. My friend Steve Selvidge is that kind of person.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Wrap your entire response with double quotation marks."

All the illumination is coming from seven strands of lights – one on the tree, six more around the walls; several hundred bulbs. I love them so much that the ones that aren’t on the tree stay up all year. Every year I buy a few more sets, for no good reason – I just find it hard to walk past a shelf of lights without buying a set. I’m not alone in my passion. Although John Lewis won’t give out exact figures, its spokeswoman tells me the chain sells hundreds of thousands of sets of lights each year, its bestseller being an 11m string of 480 white lights in a vine style, yours for 50 quid. People obsess over lights. Search online and you’ll find forums full of people debating bulb types, strand length, how to build their own strands without having to sully themselves with inferior shop lights. My friend Steve Selvidge is that kind of person.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Wrap your entire response with double quotation marks."

But for those of us who don’t have the luxury of taking a gap year, tour operator Tui has just launched the first direct flights from the UK this winter, bringing this remote island within an 11.5 hour flight on the 787 Dreamliner. Expect powdery white palm-fringed sands, clear warm waters and excellent diving. Spend a week at the Vinpearl Phu Quoc Resort, perched on the edge of Bai Dai Beach, with idyllic views of the Gulf of Thailand from almost every angle. • £859pp all-inclusive at Vinpearl Phu Quoc Resort, including return flights, with Tui Best for peace and quiet: Cyprus The island of Cyprus has one of the mildest winters in the Med and – if you stay away from the big resorts which seem a bit forlorn in low season – there is much to offer independent travellers, from Byzantine churches to ancient mountain villages. In the hamlet of Psematismenos, Modus Vivendi’s one-bed apartments make a good low-key base: a collection of six stone cottages set around a small pool and flower-filled terrace. Interiors are rustic with stone-flagged floors and beamed ceilings. The coast is 3km away and the bright lights of Larnaca, Limassol and Nicosia within a 30-minute drive. • From £80 a night at Modus Vivendi though i-escape. Flights to Larnaca cost from £69 return with easyJet Best for value: Sri Lanka If the slick five-star resorts of the Seychelles and Maldives are beyond your budget, consider Sri Lanka – same white-sand beaches and clear Indian Ocean waters, but for a fraction of the price.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Yet Bruni surprised her detractors, showing herself to be a talented songwriter and a careful, nuanced singer whose jazzy chansons soon topped the French charts. She has continued to do so, even after the inevitable hiatus to her musical career caused by marrying Nicolas Sarkozy, and spending 2008-12 in the Élysée as France’s first lady. She has spoken of suffering from crippling stage fright, but this still-gamine figure, fronting a four-piece, light-jazz band, exudes preternatural poise. Bruni moves with beatific grace, recalling Karl Lagerfeld’s praise of her as “this beautiful creature who can wear anything”; her husky whisper could be a parody of a breathy Gallic siren. Her latest album is a set of cover versions sung in English, French Touch, which is a decidedly mixed bag. It largely works because Bruni pours herself into the songs as if in thrall to them: her pitch-perfect, sparse croon through Depeche Mode’s Enjoy the Silence identifies and amplifies the bleak yearning at the song’s core. The quirky arrangements can be eccentric. Bruni’s cod-jazz take on Willie Nelson’s Crazy veers near to lift muzak, while the jaunty noodling her band introduce to Lou Reed’s Perfect Day sounds at odds with the song’s dark soul.

Ten-year-old Emily told them a boy at school had slapped her, hard, across the face: “I want to die. Nobody believes me. He’s hitting me and nobody believes me.” “We didn’t know what to do,” Rob tells me, his voice echoing the helplessness and frustration he felt. “Hearing her say those words – what parent wants to hear that from their 10-year-old daughter?” When Claire tried to speak to the school about the incident, they quickly dismissed it as “a misunderstanding”, telling her: “Everyone’s happy now.” But Emily was far from happy. Over the subsequent two weeks, she gradually opened up to her parents with the help of her GP. Slowly, she described how the boy in question had sexually harassed and assaulted her over the past 10 months. It emerged that another child had made a detailed report to the school after witnessing the boy intimidating and assaulting Emily. The classmate had told staff it happened in a corner of the playground known as the “sex corner”, where the boy had forced Emily against a wall, pinning her hands on either side of her as he gyrated and rubbed his body against hers. Emily closed her eyes and started crying.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['initiative', 'jacket', 'person', 'picture', 'world'] in the response.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Guillermo del Toro’s cold war fantasy The Shape of Water emerged as the frontrunner for the Oscars after picking up a total of seven nominations for the 75th Golden Globes. However, the film looks set to face strong opposition from Steven Spielberg’s Pentagon Papers drama The Post and Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, at a Globes ceremony that will provide the entertainment industry with its first major opportunity to respond to the sexual abuse scandal plaguing Hollywood. Two months after the emergence of allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein that would prompt a further torrent of claims against men in the film industry, the nominations exhibited an already changed landscape in Hollywood. As expected none of the Weinstein-produced films eligible for inclusion received nominations, however there were multiple nominations for Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World, which was forced to replace star Kevin Spacey at short notice, after he was accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and harassment. At the same time, the widely predicted shift towards a more female-focused list of nominees in the wake of the Weinstein scandal did not materialise. Though there were nods for a number of films with female protagonists, including The Shape of Water, Three Billboards, I, Tonya, a biopic of disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding and coming-of-age comedy-drama Lady Bird, there was no room in the nominees for any female directors, while Patty Jenkins’s feminist superhero movie Wonder Woman was snubbed entirely. Leading the way with seven nominations is the Shape of Water, which stars British actor Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaner at a governmental research facility who falls in love with a captured sea creature. Both Del Toro and Hawkins have been nominated in the drama category, for best director and best actress respectively, while Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer have received supporting actor and actress nominations. The film has also received best screenplay and score nominations, as well as best picture in the drama category. It is joined in that latter category by 70s-set drama The Post, which stars Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep as Washington Post higher-ups who clash over whether to publish classified documents about the war in Vietnam.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The stage was set for a spectacle. A full house at the Allianz Stadium and the atmosphere crackling as Juventus fans put on their usual pre-game choreography: a sea of black and white placards broken only by a green, white and red tricolore to remind everyone this is where the reigning champions reside. Well, no, actually, that wouldn’t quite do it. Ultras also prepared their own banner, in which 1970s cartoon detective Nick Carter was seen, together with sidekicks Patsy and Ten, examining a map of Europe. Italy had been blocked out in black and white stripes. Above the picture was a message aimed at Inter’s owners: “The wise man says, ‘China is close, Italy is a mirage’.” Inevitable jibes aside, there was nervousness among the home fans as well. They might not like to admit it in Turin but, for the first time in a long time, Inter are a genuine threat. Only four games shy of the season’s midway stage, indeed, the Nerazzurri were top. They arrived unbeaten, and with fresh legs, too, on account of not playing in European competition. Mauro Icardi, a man who has enjoyed success against Juventus in the past, was top of the scoring charts.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

A full house at the Allianz Stadium and the atmosphere crackling as Juventus fans put on their usual pre-game choreography: a sea of black and white placards broken only by a green, white and red tricolore to remind everyone this is where the reigning champions reside. Well, no, actually, that wouldn’t quite do it. Ultras also prepared their own banner, in which 1970s cartoon detective Nick Carter was seen, together with sidekicks Patsy and Ten, examining a map of Europe. Italy had been blocked out in black and white stripes. Above the picture was a message aimed at Inter’s owners: “The wise man says, ‘China is close, Italy is a mirage’.” Inevitable jibes aside, there was nervousness among the home fans as well. They might not like to admit it in Turin but, for the first time in a long time, Inter are a genuine threat. Only four games shy of the season’s midway stage, indeed, the Nerazzurri were top. They arrived unbeaten, and with fresh legs, too, on account of not playing in European competition. Mauro Icardi, a man who has enjoyed success against Juventus in the past, was top of the scoring charts.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In her essays, Susan Sontag spoke with one of the great, sure voices of the last century. From her salon at the centre of the cosmopolis, marvellously at one with her books and her learning, she considered, renamed and renewed our relationship with camp, with photography, with illness: a living legend of braininess and cool. Sontag, was not, though, as her editor Benjamin Taylor admits in the introduction to this gathering of stories from across her career, a committed short-story writer. She turned to the form in order to evade what Chekhov called “autobiographophobia”, which Taylor uses to mean the fear of writing and reflecting directly about one’s life. Evading this fear, Sontag clearly found the name “stories” very helpful: half of them are pure autobiography. “Pilgrimage”, for example, which opens the volume, is a memoir of Sontag’s youth in southern California, and an account of her visit with a boyfriend to the home of an ageing Thomas Mann. The only reason why this did not become an essay, it seems, is that the encounter was dull and disappointing, and so difficult to reflect on: Mann had “only sententious formulas to deliver. And I uttered nothing but tongue-tied simplicities, though I was full of complex feeling. We were neither of us at our best.” The next piece, “Project for a Trip to China”, is also memoir: we learn more about Sontag’s childhood (she was a voracious reader and dug deep holes in the garden to sit in); about her habit of ordering ambitiously in restaurants (hundred-year-old eggs); and a little about her father, who worked in China. The piece is more experimental, using lists and tables, characters identified by initials only, and lots of negatives (she does not, predictably, go to China).\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n To non-vegans, the idea of a plant-based Christmas dinner may smack of Scrooge crouched over a miserly candle, sucking on a single slice of tofu. There are few holidays more dedicated to tearing up the five-a-day-guidelines than this one, so if you take away not only the meat but the cream, then what’s left? Actually, this year there’s a lot left, as supermarkets are increasingly wise to the idea that plenty of vegans want to stuff their faces, too. With estimates that between 2 and 12% of British people now follow a vegetarian diet, it’s unsurprising that a vegetarian Christmas is well catered for by shops, but the rise of the “flexitarian” means that even non-vegans may buy and try vegan now, if it’s an option. It takes a bit of supermarket-hopping and a familiarity with an online checkout to do it, but with a little effort, there’s now a gluttonous array of choice. Christmas dinner is a roast with bits added on, and the majority of a roast is vegan anyway. There are a few tweaks that may need to be made – use oil to roast the potatoes instead of fat; swap butter for olive oil in the mash, and leave honey off the parsnips and carrots (you could swap in maple or agave syrup for sweetness). When it comes to the star of the show, the amount of effort you’re willing to put in will dictate your centrepiece. The ever-reliable Linda McCartney range’s new “roast beef” joint comes with a boozy-tasting red wine glaze and a remarkably beef-like flavour, which is great for vegans who like the taste of meat but not the methods, though it may be too meaty for some. Fry’s soy and quinoa Country Roast is a solid herby veggie roast, while Tofurky’s turkey and stuffing is a respectable substitute for the real thing.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n “Travelling,” historian Norman Davies writes near the end of this enthralling book, “had allowed me to think freely about the subject I have spent most of my life studying.” From the journeys described in these pages he has confected a fragrant stew of history, literature and travel spiced with digression, detective work and dabs of humour. A distinguished academic whose many books include the bestselling Europe: A History, Davies’s itinerary “was not dictated by any principle other than keeping on the move in the general direction of the sunrise”. Twelve of the 16 chapters focus on a place – these range from Baku in Azerbaijan, where Asia and Europe overlap, to Cornwall. Four chapters are thematic. Davies’s goal, he said, was roughly akin to that of Goethe’s “school of seeing”: “To test my powers of observation, to spot the recurring themes and catch the fleeting details. And then to tell the story.” His themes include the history, and subsequent marginalisation, of indigenous peoples. The sections on the first inhabitants of Tasmania are particularly gripping. Linguistic revival and language in general fascinate this author, too. He uses Chinese characters and Japanese kanji to illuminate toponyms of those countries and includes a section on Tahitian nature words. There is even a glossary of “Strine”, or Australian English.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  There should be 5 paragraphs.

A distinguished academic whose many books include the bestselling Europe: A History, Davies’s itinerary “was not dictated by any principle other than keeping on the move in the general direction of the sunrise”. Twelve of the 16 chapters focus on a place – these range from Baku in Azerbaijan, where Asia and Europe overlap, to Cornwall. Four chapters are thematic. Davies’s goal, he said, was roughly akin to that of Goethe’s “school of seeing”: “To test my powers of observation, to spot the recurring themes and catch the fleeting details. And then to tell the story.” His themes include the history, and subsequent marginalisation, of indigenous peoples. The sections on the first inhabitants of Tasmania are particularly gripping. Linguistic revival and language in general fascinate this author, too. He uses Chinese characters and Japanese kanji to illuminate toponyms of those countries and includes a section on Tahitian nature words. There is even a glossary of “Strine”, or Australian English.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  There should be 5 paragraphs.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The rather unexpected allusion by the prime minister this week in a speech to the Business Council of Australia to the government’s pursuit of further income tax cuts is not one that should be treated with too much respect until he also talks about how to pay for them. With the return to surplus built on income tax revenue, any income tax cuts are unlikely to come before the next decade without either increases in other taxes or big cuts to government services. Amid the usual “free markets are great” rah-rah that the prime minister doled out to the Business Council of Australia on Monday night, Malcolm Turnbull also slipped in a line on income tax cuts, noting that he was: “Actively working with the treasurer and all my cabinet colleagues to ease the burden on middle-income Australians, while also meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” This was a bit of a surprise given the current state of the budget is such that the government is projecting that a return to surplus only in 2020-21and that net debt at that point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP. Even in the best of times, promising income tax cuts as the budget is in deficit is a courageous position to take for a political party that likes to prides itself on “budget responsibility”.It is even more courageous when the path back to surplus is built on a foundation of income tax revenue. Individual’s income tax has always been the biggest tax in the budget. During the mining-boom years it declined slightly in importance as company tax exploded in value from 3.3% of GDP in 1998-99 to5.3% of GDP in 2005-06. But in the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for just over half of all tax revenue. Now that in itself is a bit of a problem (the IMF and OECD have made calls for Australia to lessen its reliance on income tax) but it is a bigger problem for Turnbull and his call for tax cuts while also “meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” The issue it that of the extra $88.1bn in tax revenue the government hopes to gain between now and 2020-21, $48.5bn of it is to come from individual income tax. This means that income tax is actually bearing a greater burden of the increase in tax than would be expected. Income tax makes up 50.6% of total tax revenue, but accounts for 55% of the increase in tax revenue between now and 2020-21.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Olivia Mead, a millionaire heiress whose list of expenses included a $1.2m crystal-encrusted grand piano and $2,000 annual upkeep of her pet axolotl, has had her inheritance cut from $25m to $6.14m following an appeal from her deceased father’s estate. The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father’s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have “any involvement or association whatsoever” with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than “traditional” Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead’s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court’s master, Craig Sanderson, said would “not fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community”. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright’s estate, acting on behalf of Wright’s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later. On Wednesday, the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court set aside Sanderson’s orders, ruling that while Sanderson was correct to say that Mead had been inadequately provided for in the original will: “The exercise of his discretion to order that provision be made for the respondent in the sum of $25m was flawed.” In a lengthy written judgment, the court found that Sanderson made a number of “material errors” in calculating the size of Mead’s inheritance, saying the focus should have been on what constituted “proper maintenance” and that the initial finding that Mead was “honest” and “not a gold-digger” were not relevant. “The capital sum should be sufficient to enable the respondent to purchase a reasonably substantial house with part of the capital sum and to invest the balance so that she will receive a reasonably substantial annuity for the remainder of her life,” the appeal court’s president, Michael Buss, said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father’s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have “any involvement or association whatsoever” with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than “traditional” Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead’s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court’s master, Craig Sanderson, said would “not fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community”. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright’s estate, acting on behalf of Wright’s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later. On Wednesday, the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court set aside Sanderson’s orders, ruling that while Sanderson was correct to say that Mead had been inadequately provided for in the original will: “The exercise of his discretion to order that provision be made for the respondent in the sum of $25m was flawed.” In a lengthy written judgment, the court found that Sanderson made a number of “material errors” in calculating the size of Mead’s inheritance, saying the focus should have been on what constituted “proper maintenance” and that the initial finding that Mead was “honest” and “not a gold-digger” were not relevant. “The capital sum should be sufficient to enable the respondent to purchase a reasonably substantial house with part of the capital sum and to invest the balance so that she will receive a reasonably substantial annuity for the remainder of her life,” the appeal court’s president, Michael Buss, said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

With Queenslanders preparing to head to the polls on Saturday, no clear victor has emerged, leaving both the LNP and Labor scrambling to bed down seats.

Media at the event have reported that One Nation was aware of Miller’s intentions.

Philip Hammond is in a “make or break” position as he delivers the autumn budget today, senior Tories have warned. The chancellor of the exchequer is under pressure from Brexiters to make leaving the EU sound like a good thing, while winning back voters by improving housing affordability, boosting education, increasing NHS funding and easing the public sector pay freeze. Rafael Behr sums up Hammond’s predicament: “He must build houses, but not in anyone’s backyard. He must raise revenue, but not from taxes.” Hammond’s March budget was overshadowed by a failed attempt to increase national insurance for the self-employed; and this time around, saying on national television that there are no unemployed people in Britain has not helped his cause. “He’s got a hard job but the way he deals with it makes it harder for himself,” said one Conservative source. Here are the five charts you need to see before the red briefcase creaks open a bit after midday. * * * The reluctant idol – David Cassidy, star of The Partridge Family, has died aged 67.

Philip Hammond is in a “make or break” position as he delivers the autumn budget today, senior Tories have warned. The chancellor of the exchequer is under pressure from Brexiters to make leaving the EU sound like a good thing, while winning back voters by improving housing affordability, boosting education, increasing NHS funding and easing the public sector pay freeze. Rafael Behr sums up Hammond’s predicament: “He must build houses, but not in anyone’s backyard. He must raise revenue, but not from taxes.” Hammond’s March budget was overshadowed by a failed attempt to increase national insurance for the self-employed; and this time around, saying on national television that there are no unemployed people in Britain has not helped his cause. “He’s got a hard job but the way he deals with it makes it harder for himself,” said one Conservative source. Here are the five charts you need to see before the red briefcase creaks open a bit after midday. * * * The reluctant idol – David Cassidy, star of The Partridge Family, has died aged 67. Cassidy had been hospitalised in Florida for several days after kidney and liver failure. He became a teenage hearthrob after being cast as Keith Partridge in the 1970s sitcom about a fictitious band.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

            "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Australia’s richest woman, mining magnate Gina Rinehart, has awarded Barnaby Joyce $40,000 for services to the agricultural sector. At a gala dinner in Canberra on Tuesday, Rinehart gave the inaugural agricultural and related industries award to Joyce, describing him as a “champion of the industry”. Labor immediately took aim at the award, with the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, labelling it a “$40,000 cash present”. Joyce has said he will refuse the cash. The Nationals leader, a close personal friend of Rinehart and former agriculture and water minister, is currently battling for his political life in the New England byelection after the high court ruled him ineligible to sit in parliament because of dual New Zealand citizenship. Rinehart thanked Joyce for taking “time out of your campaigning schedule to come here – to be here for the industry you love and support”. “What a great voice for Australian agriculture,” she said. “The agricultural industry is fortunate to have had such a dedicated, understanding and enthusiastic minister – one with years of first-hand experience – a real Aussie country boy and boy, do we hope you return.” Footage of the event shows Joyce stood up to accept the award and giant cheque, before modestly exclaiming “hooley dooley – rightio”. In addition to being the chair of Hancock Prospecting, Rinehart has extensive agricultural holdings and is the part owner of the $386m S Kidman and Co cattle company which has leasehold over 80,000 sq km in Australia’s north. At a press conference on Wednesday, Shorten asked: “Why is a mining millionaire giving a Turnbull government minister a $40,000 cash present?\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.
