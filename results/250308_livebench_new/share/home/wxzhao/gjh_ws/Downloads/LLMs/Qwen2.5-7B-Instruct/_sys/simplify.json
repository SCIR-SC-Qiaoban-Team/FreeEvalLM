      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n What does it mean when dancers express emotion on stage? Do they bring real-life experiences to those highly choreographed moments when they’re leaping with ecstasy, racked by grief or, as in the climax of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring, dancing themselves to death on behalf of a fearful, threatened community? These are some of the questions posed by Goat, the raw, funny and occasionally searing new piece of dance theatre that Ben Duke has made for Rambert. The setting is an ambiguous space that is part meeting hall, part performance arena, and its “characters” are a group of dancers and musicians who have gathered to enact some kind of cathartic emotional ritual. Miguel Altunaga plays a reporter sent to describe it, and the tone at first is wickedly funny as Altunaga – a pitch perfect combination of intrusive and bewildered – tries to make sense of what’s happening. “Amazing energy,” he pronounces as the group rock through a happy-clappy ensemble. Then as the group divide into individual solos, contorting their bodies into expressions of private feeling, he trails after the dancers, hoping for elucidation. One of them, her limbs tied into an agonised knot, explains breathlessly that she’s dancing about the “stigma of addiction”. Another, his eyes rolling back in his head with exertion, says he’s expressing a sense of betrayal. It’s a brilliant riff on the worst cliches of interpretative modern dance but Duke is soon flipping the work into something deeper, darker and more personal.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "response":"Section 1\nThe text discusses a new dance performance called \"Goat\" created by Ben Duke for the Rambert company. The performance explores the emotions expressed by dancers in their choreographed movements. These movements can represent real-life experiences, such as happiness, grief, or even characters facing personal challenges like addiction or betrayal.\n\nSection 2\nThe setting of the performance is described as a space that combines a meeting hall and a performance area. There are characters in the form of dancers and musicians, who seem to gather for some kind of emotional ritual. Miguel Altunaga, a reporter, observes them and tries to understand their actions, finding humor in some moments while seeking deeper meanings from others.\n\nSection 3\nThe text mentions that the performance initially feels witty and entertaining, with the ensemble dances being particularly lighthearted and joyful. However, the solo performances that follow reveal more personal and intense emotions, such as pain and betrayal, suggesting a deeper exploration of human feelings.\n\nSection 4\nThe description of the dancing focuses on specific dancers' attempts to communicate their inner struggles through their leaps and contortions on stage. One dancer talks about her struggle with addiction, showing her agony through her body language. Another explains that his exertion represents a feeling of being betrayed, mirroring some of the clichés often seen in modern dance.\n\nSection 5\nThe performance appears to use these individual and group dance sequences as tools to convey a message. The message seems to be an exploration of emotional catharsis and personal challenges through highly expressive and choreographed dance. What the audience takes away from this (the \"message\") might influence the \"outcome\" of the performance and, in turn, help them understand the complexities of human emotions more deeply.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Ministers have sought to see off a potential rebellion by Conservative MPs that could have brought a first defeat over the EU withdrawal bill by partially backing down on the future status of EU human rights measures in UK law. Following another day of debate about the bill, which seeks to transpose EU statute into UK law post-Brexit, the government faced possible defeat over amendments intended to maintain the scope of the EU charter on fundamental rights. Several of the amendments were tabled by Dominic Grieve, the Tory former attorney general and a leading Brexit rebel, with speculation that enough of his fellow Tories would back some of these to inflict defeat. However, the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, said the government was willing to work with Grieve to see how rights under the charter could be kept after Brexit, and would introduce its own amendment to this effect later in the bill’s passage. Grieve said this was sufficient reassurance for him and that he would not press for a vote on his amendments. Ken Clarke, another leading Conservative Brexit rebel, refused to guarantee he would not press for a vote on one amendment, which would allow Britons to mount legal challenges under the charter after Brexit, to which he was the second signatory after Grieve. However, with Grieve backing away, the chances of a government defeat were notably lessened if a vote was called. Buckland said he did not fully agree with Grieve’s amendment, which would allow challenges to EU law retained after Brexit “on the grounds that it is in breach of general principles of EU law”, and questioned whether it would add anything “that is relevant or material” to existing rights. But Buckland said: “Let me say that we do recognise the strength of views from my right honourable friend and, indeed, from other honourable members and honourable friends on this issue – many of whom have spoken this afternoon. “We’re listening, and we are prepared to look again at this issue to make sure that we are taking an approach that can command the support of this house.” Buckland said he would happily discuss a way forward with Grieve, “and agree to work together with us in this shared endeavour”, which would result in a government amendment in the report stage, the next part of the bill’s passage through the Commons.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Amsterdam has won the right to become the new host for the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In a nail-biting final round last night, the 19 European cities that had put in bids had been whittled down to Milan and Amsterdam, sharing an equal number of votes. A draw from a hat sealed it for Amsterdam. Moments later, the same scenario played out for the European Banking Authority (EBA), with Paris and Dublin going into a hat and Paris being drawn. And so it is settled. The EMA will move from London to Amsterdam after Brexit – taking with it nearly 900 jobs, a budget of €322m, and some 40,000 business visits every year, which support local hotels, restaurants, taxis and so on. Also likely to move with the EMA is the attendant industry that congregates around it for easy access to the regulator. It’s a substantial loss of finances, talent, infrastructure and influence. As the EMA leaves the UK, the question now becomes: does the UK leave the EMA? The EMA is the regulatory body for the single market for medicines, and the two are entwined.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The coming of age of English at the beginning of the 17th century, after a golden generation of extraordinary growth and innovation, is symbolised by the publication of a landmark edition that the playwright himself had never bothered with in his own lifetime.

In the words of one critic: “It is hard to overstate the importance of this literary, cultural and commercial moment.” The book now known as the First Folio (the first authoritative edition of Shakespeare’s plays) established “Shakespeare” for all time and it did this in two principal ways.

The trove of work thus assembled gave posterity not just a cast of immortal characters (Bottom, Falstaff, Lear, Portia, Jaques, Prospero et al), but also a heap of new words (including, for example, catastrophe, exaggerate, assassinate, indifference, monopoly and paradox). Second, it definitively connects his contemporary Ben Jonson (who declared his rival to be “the soul of the age”) and some of the actors who had first performed these plays with the historical person, the playwright himself, a figure helpfully illustrated by a famous frontispiece, the engraved portrait of the artist that has become an icon of “Shakespeare studies”. Other facts about the First Folio, a canon of incomparable power and authority, and the text that would help launch Shakespeare’s global literary afterlife are indisputable: both its value (somewhere north of $5m in rare books’ sales) and its comparative rarity (approximately 240 copies survive worldwide in public and private collections).\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "response":"<<The Birth of Shakespeare's Legacy>>\n\nIn 1612, playwright Thomas Heywood wrote \"An Apology for Actors,\" praising the English language, stating that it had evolved from being harsh and uneven to a refined and perfect language. This marks the beginning of the 17th century when the English language matured after a period of significant growth and innovation.\n\nIn 1623, seven years after Shakespeare’s death, a bookseller named Edward Blount published a book, known today as the First Folio. It was a groundbreaking collection of Shakespeare's plays, including 18 works not previously published, such as \"Macbeth,\" \"Julius Caesar,\" \"As You Like It,\" and \"The Tempest.\" This publication was crucial for several reasons:\n\n1. **Preservation of Future Classics**: The First Folio preserved many of Shakespeare's plays, ensuring their survival and recognition for future generations. Without this volume, many of these plays might have been lost.\n\n2. **Introduction of New Words**: The book introduced audiences to new and innovative words like \"catastrophe,\" \"exaggerate,\" and \"assassinate,\" enriching the English language.\n\n3. **Establishing Shakespeare's Fame**: The First Folio officially connected Shakespeare's plays to the figures who originally performed them—Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and the actors. It also featured a famous frontispiece—an engraved portrait of Shakespeare that would become iconic.\n\n4. **Historical Value**: The First Folio is extremely valuable and rare, with only about 240 copies surviving worldwide. These copies are considered a cornerstone of \"Shakespeare studies\" and hold immense cultural and literary significance.\n\nThe publication of the First Folio not only preserved Shakespeare's legacy but also played a critical role in transforming him from a playwright into a literary icon, and it laid the groundwork for his global literary influence.",

It was a groundbreaking collection of Shakespeare's plays, including 18 works not previously published, such as \"Macbeth,\" \"Julius Caesar,\" \"As You Like It,\" and \"The Tempest.\" This publication was crucial for several reasons:\n\n1. **Preservation of Future Classics**: The First Folio preserved many of Shakespeare's plays, ensuring their survival and recognition for future generations. Without this volume, many of these plays might have been lost.\n\n2. **Introduction of New Words**: The book introduced audiences to new and innovative words like \"catastrophe,\" \"exaggerate,\" and \"assassinate,\" enriching the English language.\n\n3. **Establishing Shakespeare's Fame**: The First Folio officially connected Shakespeare's plays to the figures who originally performed them—Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and the actors. It also featured a famous frontispiece—an engraved portrait of Shakespeare that would become iconic.\n\n4. **Historical Value**: The First Folio is extremely valuable and rare, with only about 240 copies surviving worldwide. These copies are considered a cornerstone of \"Shakespeare studies\" and hold immense cultural and literary significance.\n\nThe publication of the First Folio not only preserved Shakespeare's legacy but also played a critical role in transforming him from a playwright into a literary icon, and it laid the groundwork for his global literary influence.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Ratko Mladić, the Serb warlord who terrorised Bosnia in the 1990s, was on Wednesday forcibly removed from court after a shouting outburst delayed the reading of the verdict in his trial for the last genocide committed in Europe. The long-anticipated verdict was previously delayed for half an hour after Mladic asked the judge if he could take a short bathroom break. The delay was extended as rumours began to circulate that the former Bosnian Serb commander, who had appeared healthy when sitting in court, had suddenly been taken ill. As he entered the ICTY courtroom, Mladic had infuriated relatives of the victims as gave a broad smile and gave a thumbs up to the cameras. Mladić, who was commander of the Bosnian Serb army during the 1992-95 Bosnian conflict and for several years was one of the world’s most wanted fugitives, is now 74 and in poor health. His lawyers have argued he is not well enough to hear his verdict and sentence in person, but it is not clear whether they will seek a last-minute postponement. A judge has already rejected a defence effort earlier this month to have the judgment put off. The trial in The Hague, which took 530 days spread over more than four years, is arguably the most significant war crimes case in Europe since the Nuremberg tribunal, in part because of the scale of the atrocities involved. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) heard from 591 witnesses and examined nearly 10,000 exhibits concerning 106 separate crimes. Legal scholars say Mladić is almost certain to be found guilty of genocide for the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995, where more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were killed, most by summary execution. The Bosnian Serb political leader, Radovan Karadžić, was convicted of genocide last year for his role in the Srebrenica killings.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The Electoral Commission has noted, in documents seen by the Guardian, that Darren Grimes, who was 23 at the time, was apparently able to coordinate large sums to be spent with a social media marketing firm before receiving official confirmation of the amounts Vote Leave were intending to give him. Vote Leave, Grimes and a third group, Veterans for Britain, are under investigation by the election regulator over referendum spending. It was not against election rules for Vote Leave to donate to Grimes or other third parties as long as the spending was not coordinated.

A document submitted by the commission as part of the review process reveals the relationship between Vote Leave and Grimes. It describes how Grimes told Vote Leave on 13 June last year he would like to use a donation offered at an unknown date the previous week on a digital campaign with Aggregate IQ. The referendum was held 10 days later. Vote Leave told Grimes on 14 June that it had decided to donate £400,000 to him, the day after Vote Leave itself received a £1m donation, and Grimes provided his AIQ reference number for the payment to be made directly. “It appears Mr Grimes was in a position to make arrangements with AIQ to provide services to him on 13 June ... before receiving confirmation of the amount to be donated,” the review said.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

But now researchers say they’ve worked out why lefties are overrepresented in some elite sports but not others. The study, published in the journal Biology Letters, suggests that being left-handed is a particular advantage in interactive sports where time pressures are particularly severe, such as table tennis and cricket – possibly because their moves are less familiar to their mostly right-handed opponents, who do not have time to adjust. “The data suggests that the heavier the time constraints are operating in a sport, the larger the proportion of left-handers,” said the study’s author, Dr Florian Loffing of the University of Oldenburg in Germany. “We are less used to playing lefties, and [so] might end up in not developing the optimal strategies to compete with them.” While it is thought that about 10-13% of the population is left-handed, it has long been noted that in certain interactive sports there is often a surprisingly high proportion of left-handers playing at elite levels. Southpaw stars have seen significant success in sport, with big names including baseball aces Sandy Koufax and Randy Johnson, cricketers Garfield Sobers and Mitchell Johnson and table tennis’s Wang Nan and Kasumi Ishikawa. Previous research has punted a number of possible explanations, including that left-handers have more efficient connections between the two hemispheres of their brain. Others have suggested that lefties have the edge due to an element of surprise: since most players are right-handed, players will be more used to playing against right-handed partners. But the question remained: why did different sports show such different proportions of left-handed players? To probe the issue, Loffing collected the names and handedness of the top 100 or so players for badminton, squash, tennis, table tennis and – for men only – cricket and baseball, across six years between 2009 and 2014.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

To probe the issue, Loffing collected the names and handedness of the top 100 or so players for badminton, squash, tennis, table tennis and – for men only – cricket and baseball, across six years between 2009 and 2014.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Unlike traditional archaeology that involves digging and unearthing ancient artifacts, this discipline often deals with surface materials and societal remnants that persist today.

Despite the less enthusiastic title, the detailed review praises various aspects of the show, including the conducting, the playing and choral singing, and even the staging. The review also notes that the performance sticks to the book rather than the movie adaptation but clarifies this is due to the composer and librettist's choices.\n\nIn the second part, a statement is made about a Labour party member, Kezia Dugdale, speaking about political conduct in different countries. It humorously contrasts the Pakistani and British approaches to economic activities during and after political service.\n\nIn the third part, the performance of political parties in a specific region, Cornwall, is highlighted. There's a mystery as to why it, being one of the poorest regions in northern Europe, has a significant number of Conservative MPs, prompting the question of whether this situation reflects false consciousness, a concept from Marxist thought referring to people's incorrect perception of their social and economic circumstances.\n\nThroughout these passages, the author highlights discrepancies and contrasts in various contexts, suggesting underlying themes that might be interpretation or explanation bonuses rather than straightforward narratives.

Dugdale was reportedly told by the party not to go, but went anyway, joining a roll of parliamentarians from Nadine Dorries to Penny Mordaunt who have tried reality TV as a career accelerant, with, it is only fair to say, mixed results. Dugdale herself has not yet landed in the jungle, where the other contestants – not including many household names – are already breakfasting on bugs, weeping silently on camera etc etc. My money is on Stanley Johnson, father of Boris, who at some point will reveal that at his prep school funnel-web spiders were a delicacy and the washing facilities in the bush are a definite improvement. Everyone who goes on a show like I’m a Celebrity takes a particular risk that is now so familiar from repeated experience it can only trigger a cacophany of mental warning klaxons, however limited a contestant’s perception of their place in the world.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Taylor Swift’s Reputation has become the biggest-selling album of the year in the US in a single week, with 1.23m sales. That total comfortably beats the 931,000 copies of ÷ sold by Ed Sheeran since he released it in early March. Swift has kept all but four songs from Reputation off streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, meaning that fans need to pay to download the album or buy it on CD if they want to hear it. She also, somewhat controversially, created a promotion where fans who bought multiple copies of the album increased their chances of getting tickets to her upcoming tour, thus further driving sales. Nielsen, which collates album sales data in the US, said that Reputation sold more copies than the rest of the top 200 albums put together. Swift’s previous three albums have all sold more than a million copies in the US in their first week– a feat increasingly difficult to achieve as the popularity of downloads and CDs continues to wane. Her label Big Machine reported that a further 905,000 copies were sold worldwide, 84,000 of which were in the UK, which gives it the sixth-largest first week UK sales of the year, behind albums by Sam Smith, Liam Gallagher, Take That, Rag’N’Bone Man and Swift’s friend Ed Sheeran, who sold 671,000 copies of ÷ in the first week of its release. Swift’s impressive US total is still some way off the all-time first week sales record set by Adele in 2015, when her album 25 sold 3.37m copies in the US in its opening week. Forbes, meanwhile, has estimated that Swift is the third highest-earning female musician in 2017, dropping from the top spot last year when her earnings were driven by tour revenues from her previous album, 1989. She was estimated to have earned $44m (£33m) this year, below Beyoncé, whose Formation world tour helped generate earnings of $105m (£79m), and Adele, who earned $69m (£52m).\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "response":" Mention Taylor Swift's latest album, Reputation, has achieved a remarkable success by selling 1.23 million copies in the US within a week, topping those of Ed Sheeran's album ÷, which sold about 931,000 copies. This impressive performance can largely be attributed to Swift's unique promotional strategy. By excluding almost all songs from Reputation on streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music, Swift compelled fans to purchase the album for listening, selling the rights either by download or CD purchase. To entice even more buyers, Swift implemented a promotion where those who bought multiple copies gained a chance to secure spots in her upcoming tour. The album's first-week US sales significantly exceeded those of most albums in the top 200 charts, indicating its overwhelming popularity. Interestingly, Swift's previous three albums have also reached over a million US sales in their first week, a feat that has become progressively harder due to declining downloads and CD sales. Crucially, Reputation's first-week sales globally clocked in at 905,000, including 84,000 in the UK, placing it as the sixth-best selling debut of the year in Britain. When it comes to the first-week sales record, only Adele's 2015 album 25 stands higher, which sold an astonishing 3.37 million copies in the US. Forbes has also recognized Swift's stellar earnings, listing her as the third highest-earning female musician in 2017, with an estimated income of $44 million ($33 million in British pounds).

As the UK’s historic decision to quit the EU plays out, it doesn’t take much for the softly spoken 78-year-old and five-times rally-driving champion to cast his mind back to the days when customs posts and army checkpoints brought life in the picturesque village of Pettigo to a halt. “We had about half a dozen incendiary bombs before the big one,” he says, tilting his chin to the other classic-cars garage across the road, now run by his son. “That blew the garage right into the river.” Pettigo is unique in Ireland as it is the only village divided by the border after Ireland gained independence from Britain in 1922. The river that runs beneath his workshop window places Johnston’s Protestant family in Northern Ireland and his largely Catholic neighbours on the other side of the 1820s cut-stone bridge in the republic of Ireland. This village has seen more than its fair share of pain. Just to be associated with Britain during the Troubles of the late 60s to 90s was to be a target. “One day, a couple of IRA men came to the garage. I was held at gunpoint.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Apple has been accused of relying on students working illegal overtime to build the iPhone X, through its contractor Foxconn, which manufactures the devices in Zhengzhou, China. According to the Financial Times, students working at the Foxconn plant, as part of a three month “work experience” placement, were routinely working 11-hour days assembling the newest phone, breaking Chinese overtime laws in the process. Student labour is common, and legal, in manufacturing hubs in China. The students must be paid, and the placements must be voluntary, with the number of temporary workers swelling employment at the Zhengzhou factory threefold in the busiest time of the year, the paper reported. But, according to the Financial Times, such work experience should be limited to just 40 hours a week.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Apple has been accused of relying on students working illegal overtime to build the iPhone X, through its contractor Foxconn, which manufactures the devices in Zhengzhou, China. According to the Financial Times, students working at the Foxconn plant, as part of a three month “work experience” placement, were routinely working 11-hour days assembling the newest phone, breaking Chinese overtime laws in the process. Student labour is common, and legal, in manufacturing hubs in China. The students must be paid, and the placements must be voluntary, with the number of temporary workers swelling employment at the Zhengzhou factory threefold in the busiest time of the year, the paper reported. But, according to the Financial Times, such work experience should be limited to just 40 hours a week.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n It is a £700m cathedral to biomedical science, where scientists work together to make breakthroughs in cancer, neuroscience, pandemics and genetics. But the Francis Crick Institute is not proving to be the easiest place to concentrate. A year after opening, some of the 1,250 people working at the Crick Institute, in its central London laboratory, have complained that the open plan design, intended to assist informal collaboration, means some areas set aside for thinking and writing up research are too noisy. Chattering members of the public and colleagues celebrating PhD awards have been cited by those who, anecdotal evidence suggests, have been struggling to adapt to working alongside the building’s cavernous atrium. “There are individuals that complain,” said Nicholas Luscombe, leader of one of the Crick’s research groups. “Some people like the background noise as if they were working in a cafe. Some want absolute silence and it’s not great for that. My view is the layout has been extremely successful in terms of what it set out to achieve. You keep bumping into people and that has created new collaborations for me.” The Crick is carrying out tests on noise levels and examining whether the acoustics need to be improved, a spokeswoman said. Dr Kerstin Sailer, reader in social and spatial networks at University College London’s Bartlett School of Architecture, who is researching the way the building is performing, said “some people say it is very loud, specifically those spaces close to the atrium”.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

But the Francis Crick Institute is not proving to be the easiest place to concentrate. A year after opening, some of the 1,250 people working at the Crick Institute, in its central London laboratory, have complained that the open plan design, intended to assist informal collaboration, means some areas set aside for thinking and writing up research are too noisy. Chattering members of the public and colleagues celebrating PhD awards have been cited by those who, anecdotal evidence suggests, have been struggling to adapt to working alongside the building’s cavernous atrium. “There are individuals that complain,” said Nicholas Luscombe, leader of one of the Crick’s research groups. “Some people like the background noise as if they were working in a cafe. Some want absolute silence and it’s not great for that. My view is the layout has been extremely successful in terms of what it set out to achieve. You keep bumping into people and that has created new collaborations for me.” The Crick is carrying out tests on noise levels and examining whether the acoustics need to be improved, a spokeswoman said. Dr Kerstin Sailer, reader in social and spatial networks at University College London’s Bartlett School of Architecture, who is researching the way the building is performing, said “some people say it is very loud, specifically those spaces close to the atrium”.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n MPs have accused the government of failing to protect consumers over the price it has promised to pay for power from the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant. The Commons public accounts committee said the subsidy contract for Hinkley Point C, agreed in 2016 after years of delays, would hit poorest households hardest. The power station is expected to cost billpayers £30bn over the lengthy of the 35-year contract, adding £10-£15 to the average household energy bill. But an assessment by the committee concluded that no one in Whitehall was championing consumers’ interests during negotiations with French company EDF Energy. The final bill for consumers was exacerbated by government not renegotiating the guaranteed power price for fear that EDF and its Chinese partner CGN would walk away from the project, which the MPs said was a questionable assumption. Officials agreed a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour in 2013 but fossil fuel price projections fell between then and the contract being signed in 2016, pushing the cost to consumers up fivefold from £6bn to £30bn. At the time the Department of Energy and Climate Change – now the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy – did not consider a ceiling on the guaranteed price, the MPs were told. Meg Hillier, chair of the group of MPs, said: “Billpayers have been dealt a bad hand by the government in its approach to this project.” The criticism from the committee follows a damning report by the UK’s spending watchdog, the NAO, which found the contract for Hinkley had locked consumers into a “risky and expensive project”. The NAO attacked the government for failing to explore alternative financing models, such as taking stake in the project, a criticism that the MPs echoed. The public accounts committee said it was also disappointed that the government appeared to have no plan in place to maximise the wider benefits of the project, beyond the clean power it will provide.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n An Oxford graduate is suing the university for £1m on the grounds that his failure to get a top degree 17 years ago cost him the chance of a lucrative legal career. Faiz Siddiqui alleges the “inadequate” teaching he received on the Indian special subject part of his modern history course resulted in him getting only a low upper second degree when he took his finals in June 2000 instead of a first or high 2:1. Siddiqui, 39, has blamed the situation on a number of members of staff being absent on sabbatical leave and a failure to find cover. He has also alleged that a tutor failed to submit medical information about him to examiners. He claims he would have become an international commercial lawyer if he had gained the top qualification at the end of his time at Brasenose College, and that his clinical depression and insomnia have been significantly exacerbated by his “inexplicable failure”. The legal battle between Siddiqui and Oxford has been ongoing for more than a year. Last year a judge allowed Siddiqui’s action to proceed to be fully argued after Oxford claimed the case had no merit and had been brought outside the legal time limit. It was decided at the time that Siddiqui had a real chance of persuading a judge that the case was not time-barred or that it would be just for it to proceed in any event. At the high court in London on Tuesday, Siddiqui’s barrister, Roger Mallalieu, told Mr Justice Foskett that in 2000 Siddiqui was a “driven young man” aiming for a postgraduate qualification from an Ivy League university before a career at the tax bar in England or a major US law firm. “Whilst a 2:1 degree from Oxford might rightly seem like a tremendous achievement to most, it fell significantly short of Mr Siddiqui’s expectations and was, to him, a huge disappointment,” Mallalieu said.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n An Oxford graduate is suing the university for £1m on the grounds that his failure to get a top degree 17 years ago cost him the chance of a lucrative legal career. Faiz Siddiqui alleges the “inadequate” teaching he received on the Indian special subject part of his modern history course resulted in him getting only a low upper second degree when he took his finals in June 2000 instead of a first or high 2:1. Siddiqui, 39, has blamed the situation on a number of members of staff being absent on sabbatical leave and a failure to find cover. He has also alleged that a tutor failed to submit medical information about him to examiners. He claims he would have become an international commercial lawyer if he had gained the top qualification at the end of his time at Brasenose College, and that his clinical depression and insomnia have been significantly exacerbated by his “inexplicable failure”. The legal battle between Siddiqui and Oxford has been ongoing for more than a year. Last year a judge allowed Siddiqui’s action to proceed to be fully argued after Oxford claimed the case had no merit and had been brought outside the legal time limit. It was decided at the time that Siddiqui had a real chance of persuading a judge that the case was not time-barred or that it would be just for it to proceed in any event. At the high court in London on Tuesday, Siddiqui’s barrister, Roger Mallalieu, told Mr Justice Foskett that in 2000 Siddiqui was a “driven young man” aiming for a postgraduate qualification from an Ivy League university before a career at the tax bar in England or a major US law firm. “Whilst a 2:1 degree from Oxford might rightly seem like a tremendous achievement to most, it fell significantly short of Mr Siddiqui’s expectations and was, to him, a huge disappointment,” Mallalieu said.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Saying the NHS was already in crisis, as I – and a few other Jeremiahs – did two years ago, meant going out on a limb. Today, hardly anyone says anything else, not least because virtually all our dire predictions have become realities. Even public officials responsible for running and inspecting the NHS, who couldn’t be seen for dust then (the heads of NHS England, NHS Improvement and the Care Quality Commission), are going public on the gravity of the situation and begging the chancellor to do something in this week’s budget. Indeed, how could anyone say things are OK when, in response to an increase in the past seven years of at most 15% in A&amp;E attendances and admissions, waits in A&amp;E have gone up by 350% and waits for admission by 550%? Increasing waiting times are the canary in the mine. However, the Department of Health, whenever challenged with a another example of increasingly poor performance, excessive waits or other pressures, retorts not that this is incorrect but (without irony) that other things in the NHS are fine. In reality, all is not well. Once again, I am afraid, those who have just started to complain are saying too little and too late. The NHS isn’t getting into crisis, as they cautiously say. It is way beyond that and already failing, despite its internationally accepted efficiency.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.  Answer with at least 109 words.

Today, hardly anyone says anything else, not least because virtually all our dire predictions have become realities. Even public officials responsible for running and inspecting the NHS, who couldn’t be seen for dust then (the heads of NHS England, NHS Improvement and the Care Quality Commission), are going public on the gravity of the situation and begging the chancellor to do something in this week’s budget. Indeed, how could anyone say things are OK when, in response to an increase in the past seven years of at most 15% in A&amp;E attendances and admissions, waits in A&amp;E have gone up by 350% and waits for admission by 550%? Increasing waiting times are the canary in the mine. However, the Department of Health, whenever challenged with a another example of increasingly poor performance, excessive waits or other pressures, retorts not that this is incorrect but (without irony) that other things in the NHS are fine. In reality, all is not well. Once again, I am afraid, those who have just started to complain are saying too little and too late. The NHS isn’t getting into crisis, as they cautiously say. It is way beyond that and already failing, despite its internationally accepted efficiency.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.  Answer with at least 109 words.

The disclosure has prompted calls for the regulator to stop companies passing the cost of a discredited medieval practice on to their customers. Ofwat said any firm failing to meet its commitments to customers faced a financial penalty.

Le Page asked Severn Trent why it was still using divining rods to find pipes when there was no evidence that it worked. Replying on Twitter, the company said: “We’ve found that some of the older methods are just as effective than the new ones, but we do use drones as well, and now satellites.” Le Page then asked the other 11 water companies whether they were using water dowsing.

And if there’s one thing the Scots are good at, apart from politics, economics, terriers and whisky, it’s an honest broth. According to the Victorian journalist and author Christian Isobel Johnstone, who published her The Cook and Housewife’s Manual under the pseudonym Margaret Dods: “The French take the lead of all European people in soups and broths … the Scotch rank second, the Welsh next, and … the English, as a nation, are at the very bottom of the scale.” As an Edinburgh native, she may have been biased, but when one considers the likes of cullen skink, Scotch broth and our subject here, cock-a-leekie, it’s hard not to concede the point. The last, occasionally known as cockie-leekie, is often dated to the end of the 16th century, when the Lincolnshire-born traveller Fynes Moryson records having been served “pullet with some prunes in the broth” at a knight’s house in Scotland, although, given the widespread medieval tradition of meat and fruit pottages, it seems likely that similar dishes were once found throughout northern Europe – even (horror!) south of the border.

Catherine Brown reckons that “attempting a modern cock-a-leekie with an immature battery chicken is akin to attempting cassoulet without confit”, and, in the absence of decent chicken recommends using “a more flavourful pheasant or other game bird – cock or hen – which has roamed freely”. Having tried her recipe, I can confirm that pheasant makes a delicious soup, even when enjoyed from a bowl in a warm kitchen, rather than from a Thermos in the middle of a damp autumnal copse, but one with a distinct gamey character.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Charlie Rose was fired by CBS News on Tuesday, as his colleagues reacted with shock and horror to allegations of serial sexual harassment made against the veteran TV news show anchor – and made it clear they believe the women. In a statement, the CBS News president, David Rhodes, said his behavior was “extremely disturbing and intolerable”. “What may once have been accepted should not ever have been acceptable.” Rose said in a statement on Monday: “I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.” Asked if he has anything to say to the women who had accused him of “wrongdoings”, he replied: “It’s not wrongdoings.” Co-hosts of CBS This Morning Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell presented the show without their usual third team member, Rose, on Tuesday and broke away from their normal news reporting style to give raw, personal opinions on the behavior alleged against him. “This is a moment that demands a frank and honest assessment about where we stand and, more generally, the safety of women,” O’Donnell began. The show had opened with a straight news report on a story that now involved their own station. A CBS This Morning reporter related the facts that Rose, 75, had been suspended from his job while the company looks into detailed accusations from eight women that he had made unwanted sexual advances towards them, as revealed by the Washington Post. Allegations include lewd phone calls, walking around naked in their presence, or groping their breasts, buttocks or genital areas, and the women were employees or aspired to work for Rose at the Charlie Rose show from the late 1990s to 2011, the Post reported. “It takes a lot of courage for these women to come forward,” said O’Donnell.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n While indulging in booze can inspire cheerful merrymaking in some, for others it can lead to a tearful journey to the bottom of the glass. Now researchers say the emotions people feel when drinking could be linked to their tipple of choice. An international survey has revealed that spirits are often associated with feelings of energy, confidence and sexiness – but on the flip-side anger and tearfulness – while red wine is the drink most commonly linked to relaxation, but also tiredness. While the researchers say the reasons for the links are likely to be complex, they hope the study will urge individuals to think carefully about the alcohol they consume. “From a public health perspective a lot of the time we have focused on issues around cancer, heart disease and liver disease – but an important aspect is the balance of emotional outcomes that people are getting from alcohol,” said Mark Bellis, co-author of the research from Public Health Wales NHS Trust. The study, published in the journal BMJ Open, is based on an anonymous online questionnaire that was completed by individuals aged between 18 and 34 who had drunk alcohol in the previous year. Part of an international survey on alcohol and drug use, the questions probed the type of alcohol drunk and associated emotions, and were asked in 11 different languages, with participants taking part from 21 countries around the world. The results, based on answers from almost 30,000 participants who had reported consuming both red and white wine as well as beer and spirits in the past year, reveal that certain types of alcoholic drink appear to be linked to particular emotions. Almost 53% of participants said drinking red wine made them feel relaxed – an emotion that was also linked to beer by nearly 50% of participants, and white wine by nearly 33%. By contrast, spirits were linked to feelings of confidence by just over 59% of participants, energy by more than 58% and sexiness by just over 42%.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Now researchers say the emotions people feel when drinking could be linked to their tipple of choice. An international survey has revealed that spirits are often associated with feelings of energy, confidence and sexiness – but on the flip-side anger and tearfulness – while red wine is the drink most commonly linked to relaxation, but also tiredness. While the researchers say the reasons for the links are likely to be complex, they hope the study will urge individuals to think carefully about the alcohol they consume. “From a public health perspective a lot of the time we have focused on issues around cancer, heart disease and liver disease – but an important aspect is the balance of emotional outcomes that people are getting from alcohol,” said Mark Bellis, co-author of the research from Public Health Wales NHS Trust. The study, published in the journal BMJ Open, is based on an anonymous online questionnaire that was completed by individuals aged between 18 and 34 who had drunk alcohol in the previous year. Part of an international survey on alcohol and drug use, the questions probed the type of alcohol drunk and associated emotions, and were asked in 11 different languages, with participants taking part from 21 countries around the world. The results, based on answers from almost 30,000 participants who had reported consuming both red and white wine as well as beer and spirits in the past year, reveal that certain types of alcoholic drink appear to be linked to particular emotions. Almost 53% of participants said drinking red wine made them feel relaxed – an emotion that was also linked to beer by nearly 50% of participants, and white wine by nearly 33%. By contrast, spirits were linked to feelings of confidence by just over 59% of participants, energy by more than 58% and sexiness by just over 42%.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Yet from poinsettias to potted Christmas trees, many of these festive favourites can be extremely hard to keep alive in the conditions of the average living room for just a few weeks, let alone year to year. There is, however, a really old-school, and often overlooked, seasonal houseplant that is made from much tougher stuff: the beautiful and exotic Christmas cactus (Schlumbergera truncata and S x buckleyi). These two species (which look so similar that they share a common name) hail from the cool mountains of southeastern Brazil, where they are pollinated by hummingbirds. Unusually for a cactus, they aren’t a desert plant, but have adapted to grow on the boughs of tall rainforest trees, festooning their branches with weeping foliage and dazzling flowers. This relatively cool-weather habitat is surprisingly similar to the conditions of our British living rooms, making them perfectly adapted to thrive in hanging baskets or trail over windowsills everywhere. But what does a cactus have to do with Christmas? Not a great deal, really. In fact, in their native habitat their winter-flowering period doesn’t even coincide with Christmas. However, fortunately for gardeners like me, their habit of bursting into the most spectacular of floral displays from November to January occurs just when I need it most.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

If they realised how much we are going to end up paying, they really would go “bananas” as one MP put it. The government is hoping to defuse opposition from within its own ranks by suggesting the money will come with strings attached: it will be conditional on the EU agreeing a good trade deal or, more realistically, at least agreeing to talk about a future trade deal. May’s new offer could be enough to break the deadlock in the talks at next month’s crucial summit – provided she doesn’t say it’s a “final offer” or add unrealistic conditions to it.
