      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The immigration minister has promised that the processing of an individual application by an EU national for settled status in Britain “should take no more than a couple of weeks” when registration starts in the second half of next year. The minister, Brandon Lewis, told the Commons home affairs select committee that an extra 1,200 UK visas and immigration staff were being recruited to process an expected 3.5m applications from EU nationals over two and a half years. He also told MPs on Tuesday that he was optimistic that an agreement could be struck by Christmas on the rights of EU citizens in the UK in the Brexit negotiations. However, he declined to comment on reports that the Brexit inner cabinet had decided on Monday that the European court of justice could continue to play a role in guaranteeing their rights during a two-year transition period. The Home Office minister did confirm that those refused “settled status” and classed as non-EU nationals in Britain illegally could have their bank accounts frozen and face deportation before the hearing of any appeal in British courts. The 3million group, representing EU nationals in Britain, immediately questioned Lewis’s claim that an agreement with the EU on “settled status” was likely before Christmas. “We wonder how. Major stumbling blocks still in place,” they tweeted, noting continued differences over the role of the ECJ, over family reunification rights that could affect thousands, and regarding clarification that they should not face “hostile environment measures”. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, voiced scepticism that an extra 1,200 staff – of whom 700 had already been recruited – would be sufficient when the UK Visas and Immigration agency (UKVI) currently used 6,500 staff to process 3m visa applications a year. There was already a three-month delay in processing EU nationals’ applications for permanent residence documents, she said.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"In the quiet smattering of applause that filled the evening air, Anna Ternheim’s voice rose, clear and unadorned, catching the hearts of those who dared to listen. A pop star in Sweden’s musical constellation, Anna had carved out her place not through transcendence, but through the introspective. Her journey to this particular spot in the Brazilian rain began after the release of her sixth album, a restless phase filled with the sorrow and beauty of her homeland. Seeking refuge, she packed her bags and moved to Rio de Janeiro, a city known for its vibrant beats and endless skies.\n\nRio, instead of being a backdrop for a carefree escape or an exotic adventure, became for Anna a stage where she played out the quieter scenes of life’s dramas, filtered through a melancholic lens. Each songbirthed on the shores of that famous Brazilian city encapsulates a fragment of her thoughts and feelings, raw and unfiltered, like the fluctuating emotions of the day. The album, titled simply after her place of escape, “All the Way to Rio,” depicted more than just what she saw; it was a record of how she felt about running away, about finding a place that offered a break from the sameness of her social world.\n\nHer return to Sweden was marked with the announcement of the album, along with a string of intimate concerts set to serenade theorists and casual listeners alike. The first note of the title track was a whisper, supported by a gentle drift of guitar strings that soon coalesced into a rich tapestry. The words painted scenarios of retreat, of fleeing familiar faces in the quest for something real. In “Hold On,” the tempo and texture changed, unfolding into a dizzying swirl of guitars and organs that built into a crescendo, painting a picture of the turmoil and peace Anna found amidst the city’s chaos.\n\nThe standout track, “Battered Soul,” emerged as a testament to the album’s simplest yet most profound beauty. Its melody, reminiscent of the early days of REM, brought a tranquil resonance, a flute of nature’s calm in the whirlwind of modern music. The arpeggiated guitar played on like the flowing of a quiet river, providing a space for the listener to find solace within their own emotional landscapes. However, there was a moment in “Dreams of Blue” where the listener’s heart would nearly pause, caught in the unexpected confusion over a lyric that seemed to speak of something entirely different – a humorous break in the sorrowful melody, making one question their ears and their grasp on reality. \n\nDespite the few minutes each track inhabited, the collection was an encapsulation of a journey, woven through ups and downs with deliberate warmth and melancholy. Anna Ternheim's storytelling was clear; each song was a whisper from her heart, a memoir in music format. At merely eight songs, with six under four minutes, the album offered listeners a glimpse of something deep and lasting, yet ephemeral, a pair of eyes looking at the same sky, breathing the same air, and understanding the delicate balance between running away and finding home.\n\nP.P.S. It was this very authenticity in Anna's work that resonated with her audience, a reminder of how music can be the span between disparate emotions, weaving them together into the fabric of human experience.",

Ace ideologue of the free market Oliver Letwin, of all people, can’t substitute.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The news was announced on his Facebook page: “On behalf of the Hvorostovsky family, it is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Dmitri Hvorostovsky – beloved operatic baritone, husband, father, son, and friend – at age 55. After a two-and-a-half-year battle with brain cancer, he died peacefully this morning, November 22, surrounded by family near his home in London, UK. May the warmth of his voice and his spirit always be with us.” Hvorostovsky was born in a tough industrial city in Siberia, telling an interviewer in 2002 that as a high school student, prison looked a more likely destination than the opera stage, with “drinking, drugs and fighting,” part of his adolescence. A teenage obsession with pop music also almost claimed the singer for a different world, and his hard drinking and wild behaviour continued into his 20s and early 30s. He came to international attention in 1989 when he beat Bryn Terfel to win the Cardiff Singer of the World title. With his prematurely white hair, dashing good looks and powerful stage presence, his heartthrob image was carefully cultivated and he amassed legions of fans. A career performing in all the major opera houses and concert halls followed, and he was hailed one of the world’s greatest baritones for the rich, expressive fluidity of his voice. His fame allowed him to bring the neglected and little known Russian song repertoire into western halls, most notably with the remarkable accompanist Ivari Ilja. In the opera house he was particularly feted for his performances of Verdi, and also his charismatic and provocative interpretation of Tchaikovksy’s antihero Eugene Onegin, a role he made his own.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"The Russian opera world is mourning the loss of Dmitri Hvorostovsky, a beloved baritone who tragically passed away at age 55. Hvorostovsky, held in high esteem by both colleagues and fans, was known not just for his powerful voice but also for the rich performances and stage presence that made him a standout figure in the opera world. The news of his passing was announced on his Facebook page by his family, revealing that Hvorostovsky’s last two and a half years were a grim but graceful battle with brain cancer. Surrounded by loved ones, his end came unexpectedly soon, but with grace and the warmth of his family by his side.\n\n***\n\nBorn in a challenging environment in Siberia, Hvorostovsky’s early years were far from the glamorous path that would lead him to become one of the greatest baritones of his time.

    "filtered_answer":"The Russian opera world is mourning the loss of Dmitri Hvorostovsky, a beloved baritone who tragically passed away at age 55. Hvorostovsky, held in high esteem by both colleagues and fans, was known not just for his powerful voice but also for the rich performances and stage presence that made him a standout figure in the opera world. The news of his passing was announced on his Facebook page by his family, revealing that Hvorostovsky’s last two and a half years were a grim but graceful battle with brain cancer. Surrounded by loved ones, his end came unexpectedly soon, but with grace and the warmth of his family by his side.\n\n***\n\nBorn in a challenging environment in Siberia, Hvorostovsky’s early years were far from the glamorous path that would lead him to become one of the greatest baritones of his time.

    "response":"The film noir classic \"In a Lonely Place\" captures the essence of Los Angeles’s underbelly in the early 1950s. Humphrey Bogart stars as the disillusioned film noir staple figure, Dixon \"Dix\" Steele, a once-acclaimed screenwriter struggling with alcoholism, depression, and the pressure of his diminishing career. Gloria Grahame, in a career-defining role, plays Laurel Gray, a mysterious newcomer to Los Angeles, whose enigmatic presence becomes a beacon of hope for Dix until their relationship spirals into one of darkness and mistrust. Their complex dynamic is set against the backdrop of post-war disillusionment, capturing the essence of a generation grappling with the remnants of glory days and the stark reality of their lives' decline.\n\nTruck deliveries from a local bar across the street were what often broke Dix's late-night reverie, clinking bottles a familiar, unwanted symphony to his weary mind. Among the patrons, he met Laurel, who worked nights at a diner while pursuing her dreams of becoming a writer. Initially, it was Laurel's determination and quiet confidence that intrigued Dix, qualities starkly contrasting his own cynical, defeated demeanor. Yet, as their story progresses, the city’s noir atmosphere casts a taller shadow, darkening the plot with chilling suspense and suspicion. Dinner conversations in smoky taverns, late-night arguments that echo into the L.A. night, and the mutual dependency they develop form the tense fabric of this acclaim: is their chemistry based on genuine affection, or is it possibly something far darker?\n\nThe film’s haunting narrative grapples with themes of mistrust, jealousy, and the destructive nature of unchecked violence. Bogart's portrayal of a lonely writer torn between his longing for connection and the impulse towards malevolent behavior is intricate and intensely compelling. Gloria Grahame's portrayal of Laurel evokes both vulnerability and strength, creating a magnetic duality that keeps the audience guessing. The twists of her storyline add layers of unpredictability and enhance the film's edge-of-your-seat tension. Just when the audience believes they have unraveled the web of suspicion and deceit woven by the characters, a startling plot turn reveals a complexity that mirrors the murky streets and shadowed alleyways of the city itself.\n\n\"In a Lonely Place\" continues to resonate as a powerful exploration of human fragility and strength set against the backdrop of a bygone era’s cultural shift. Its portrayal of a tumultuous relationship colored deeply by suspicion, jealousy, and past demons provides both a captivating narrative and a timeless commentary on humanity’s darker tendencies.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Philip Hammond must borrow an extra £90bn over the next five years after the Treasury’s independent forecaster downgraded productivity growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that the chancellor faced a long period of lower than expected wages growth that would dent tax receipts and push up borrowing. The cumulative effect over the life of the parliament would add £90.5bn to the UK’s debt pile and jeopardise Hammond’s target of balancing the government’s books by 2025, it said. The Treasury said that once the positive effects of an increase in employment and better than expected borrowing over the last year are taken into account, the net borrowing rise would be £35bn, putting the chancellor in a position to reach his target of creating a surplus in the middle of the next decade. But some analysts said the OBR’s revision failed to go far enough and it continued to overestimate the capacity of British businesses to invest in new equipment and processes to drive up productivity. They argued that the forecaster should have gone further and predicted that productivity growth – which measures the average output per hour worked – of almost zero over the last seven years would continue for another five years. Joanna Davies, a UK economist at Fathom Consulting, said the OBR’s new forecast that productivity would increase at a rate of 1.1% until 2022 – almost half the 2.1% average seen in the 30 years before 2007 – still looked ambitious. She said the prospects for GDP growth would suffer a severe knock-on effect from lower productivity and a rapidly ageing population. “Over the last five years, productivity growth has averaged just 0.3%,” she said. “Combined with UN projections for working-age population growth, the UK’s trend rate of overall economic growth is probably somewhere in the range 0.5%-1% – around half the 1.5% assumed by the OBR.” The OBR chair, Robert Chote, said GDP growth would not only be hit by lower productivity, but also a weaker than expected export sector that would fail to benefit significantly from the lower pound.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"In a striking announcement that has sent ripples through the UK financial community, Chancellor Philip Hammond has found himself in a challenging position. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Treasury's main economic forecaster, has issued a report projecting significantly lower productivity growth, resulting in the need for an additional £90 billion in borrowing over the next five years. This downgrade in productivity has direct implications on wages and tax revenues, stirring concerns about the government's ability to balance the books by 2025, as previously pledged by Hammond.\n\nThe OBR’s forecast suggests a prolonged phase where wages will grow at rates lower than originally anticipated, affecting the UK's economic health. The shortfall in tax receipts, a consequence of this economic放缓将影响政府的目标，并对英国的债务水平产生重大影响。英国财政大臣哈蒙德面临的挑战是，在未来几年内找到一种方法，既能够满足额外的905亿英镑的债务负担，又能保持到2025年使政府账户达到平衡的目标。财政部门指出，一旦考虑到就业率的提升和过去一年超出预期的借贷情况，净借款的上升将为35亿英镑，这使得部长仍然有可能在未来十年中期实现财政盈余的目标。\n\n然而，一些分析人士对OBR的评估持不同意见，认为其过于乐观。他们认为，鉴于过去七年英国产出的平均小时工作量几近于零的增长，OBR预测的到2022年生产力增幅为1.1%，远高于2007年前30年的平均2.1%增长率，看起来依然不切实际。未来五年的经济增长可能会受到生产率较低和人口老龄化加速的严重影响。\n\nFathom Consulting的英国经济学家乔安娜·戴维斯（Joanna Davies）在评论OBR的新预测时说，经济增长的潜在趋势应该在0.5%至1%之间，而非OBR所认为的1.5%。戴维斯指出，自2007年以来，英国的年均生产力增长率仅为0.3%，这一现实加上联合国对工作年龄人口增长的预测，表明英国的经济前景远比目前预测的要严峻。\n\nOBR主席罗伯特·乔特（Robert Chote）也警告称，GDP增长还将受到相对较弱的出口部门的拖累，这将因英镑贬值而未能享受到应有的利益。\n\nP.P.S. 这份预测揭示了英国经济在走向全面复苏的过程中可能面临的挑战，同时强调了制定适应未来不确定性的政策的重要性。",

The shortfall in tax receipts, a consequence of this economic放缓将影响政府的目标，并对英国的债务水平产生重大影响。英国财政大臣哈蒙德面临的挑战是，在未来几年内找到一种方法，既能够满足额外的905亿英镑的债务负担，又能保持到2025年使政府账户达到平衡的目标。财政部门指出，一旦考虑到就业率的提升和过去一年超出预期的借贷情况，净借款的上升将为35亿英镑，这使得部长仍然有可能在未来十年中期实现财政盈余的目标。\n\n然而，一些分析人士对OBR的评估持不同意见，认为其过于乐观。他们认为，鉴于过去七年英国产出的平均小时工作量几近于零的增长，OBR预测的到2022年生产力增幅为1.1%，远高于2007年前30年的平均2.1%增长率，看起来依然不切实际。未来五年的经济增长可能会受到生产率较低和人口老龄化加速的严重影响。\n\nFathom Consulting的英国经济学家乔安娜·戴维斯（Joanna Davies）在评论OBR的新预测时说，经济增长的潜在趋势应该在0.5%至1%之间，而非OBR所认为的1.5%。戴维斯指出，自2007年以来，英国的年均生产力增长率仅为0.3%，这一现实加上联合国对工作年龄人口增长的预测，表明英国的经济前景远比目前预测的要严峻。\n\nOBR主席罗伯特·乔特（Robert Chote）也警告称，GDP增长还将受到相对较弱的出口部门的拖累，这将因英镑贬值而未能享受到应有的利益。\n\nP.P.S. 这份预测揭示了英国经济在走向全面复苏的过程中可能面临的挑战，同时强调了制定适应未来不确定性的政策的重要性。",

An amendment to the European Union (withdrawal bill to transfer the EU protocol on animal sentience into UK law was defeated by 313 votes to 295 on 15 November, and since then a row has developed as to what the vote meant in practice. Describing some of the reporting on the vote as “weird and dishonest”, Tory MP Zac Goldsmith tweeted a clarification that the vote had been about the correct legal procedure for ensuring animal welfare standards – not on the principle of whether animals are sentient. Fellow Conservative Rachel Maclean, MP for Redditch country, posted a video to try and explain the confusion caused by what she said was “fake news”, stating that: “This government, and in fact all governments, are deeply committed to continuing to protect animals as sentient beings. That law is already written into our own law.” Theresa May said at Wednesday’s PMQs: “We recognise and respect that animals are sentient beings, and should be treated accordingly.” Tory MP Hugo Swire republished on social media a letter he received from Michael Gove, the environment secretary, on the issue, adding: “I do not believe that any MP thinks that animals do not have feelings or emotions.” Nevertheless, the vote has triggered protests from animal rights groups, including multiple online petitions aimed at the House of Lords, UK parliament and Gove. Public figures including the presenter Sue Perkins have voiced strong criticism of MPs over the issue. Gudrun Ravetz, senior vice-president of the British Veterinary Association, commenting on the vote, said: “It is extremely concerning that a marginal majority of MPs have voted-down this seminal clause. This action undermines the government’s previous promises that the UK will continue to be known for our high standards of animal health and welfare post-Brexit.” However, Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley, pointed out that EU law still allowed many practices across Europe that animal rights groups oppose. The amendment, proposed by the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas, among others, had set out to specifically incorporate article 13 of title II of the Lisbon treaty into UK law. During debate on the amendment last Wednesday, Lucas pointed out that the origins of the clause began with the 1997 UK presidency of the EU and that from 1999 EU law had explicitly recognised that animals were sentient life forms.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"The holiday season is often marked by traditions that bring families and friends together in celebration.

Chocolate-filled calendars, in particular, have captured the hearts of young and old alike, offering a delicious way to await the festive season’s arrival. Yet, as times change, so have the varieties of advent calendars available, ranging from makeup sets to alcoholic beverages, appealing to a broad spectrum of followers and enthusiasts.\n\n***\n\nWhile the advent of new advent calendar fillings provides a diverse array of experiences, many staunch devotees still hold dear the original chocolate-stuffed calendars, believing them to be nonpareil.

For children, these moments create a tangible sense of progress towards a significant day, while for adults, they offer a small yet steadfast comfort amid the season’s hustle and bustle. The ritual ensures that each day is uniquely marked, maintaining the excitement through the countdown to Christmas. The comforting routine of these daily sweets, however, is not just about the chocolate—it’s about the collective memory of shared moments, of running to tear off the next door with eager, trembling hands.\n\n***\n\nThe evolution of the advent calendar into a more diverse consumer product reflects society’s stepping beyond traditional confines.

However, the price is often justified by the experience it provides, enhancing the sense of festivity and joy. Besides, the advent of affiliate programs and consumer-driven commerce has allowed more people to discover and potentially purchase these items. Online marketplaces and social media platforms have played a significant role in making these experiences more accessible and widespread, inviting users to not only buy but also share their experiences, thereby amplifying the festive atmosphere.\n\n***\n\nIn conclusion, the advent calendar tradition, with its roots in chocolate-filled days, has beautifully evolved into a dynamic and varied celebration of the holiday season.

The morning’s crisp air nipped at his cheeks, but he barely noticed it. Kim’s mind was already floating to the chords he’d be playing today, the ones that would later become the foundation of the track \"You | Me\" on his upcoming album. \n\nHaving lived in Norway, where the seasons danced from stark winters to sun-drenched summers, Kim found inspiration in the elemental contrasts. His music, a seamless blend of the classical and the experimental, was a gentle whisper against the wild backdrop of his homeland.

It melds effortlessly with the essence of early Steve Reich or Terry Riley’s experimental compositions, honing in on the looped complexities and subtle changes in sound.\n\nAdding to the unique tapestry of the album is the involvement of three drummers—Ingar Zach, Hans Hulbækmo, and Tony Buck from The Necks. As their drumming weaves through Myhr's guitar and electronics, it's as if they create the sound of the fjord itself, its magnificent and tranquil momentum occasionally punctuated by the serene depths found in sombre eddies, a metaphor for the depth beneath the still water of Myhr’s music.\n\nP.S. The album \"You | Me\" by Norwegian composer and experimental guitarist Kim Myhr has been lauded for its ability to draw listeners into a blissful and introspective journey, one that immerses them in a sonic landscape where time seems to dissolve, reminiscent of big-sky vistas and early experimental music of Steve Reich and Terry Riley.",

You’ll find everything from grand ensembles to intimate solo confessionals, and this recording is best suited to the latter. That’s because conductor Pablo Heras-Casado has a tendency to over-shape the bigger stuff, to traffic-control the corners and smooth out the ride. With Monteverdi, we need the rough and the spontaneous. But individual musicians and singers of the Balthasar Neumann are wonderful, and they shine in their nimble duos and trios – try the piercingly delivered Salve Regina from sopranos Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The name of this 1640 collection means “moral and spiritual forest” and it is Monteverdi in the most exploratory mood – the culmination of his three decades as maestro di cappella at St Mark’s Basilica in Venice, with its sumptuous acoustic and crack instrumental band and 40-piece choir to match. You’ll find everything from grand ensembles to intimate solo confessionals, and this recording is best suited to the latter. That’s because conductor Pablo Heras-Casado has a tendency to over-shape the bigger stuff, to traffic-control the corners and smooth out the ride. With Monteverdi, we need the rough and the spontaneous. But individual musicians and singers of the Balthasar Neumann are wonderful, and they shine in their nimble duos and trios – try the piercingly delivered Salve Regina from sopranos Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"In 1640, a collection was published with a name that promised both grandeur and introspection—\"Moral and spiritual forest\". This was none other than Claudio Monteverdi's \"Selva morale e spirituale\", a work heralding the culmination of over three decades of his magisterial vision as the maestro di cappella at the famed St. Mark's Basilica in Venice. The basilica, with its exceptional acoustic properties and a formidable ensemble of instrumentalists and singers, provided the perfect canvas for Monteverdi's experimental compositions. The collection explored a myriad of moods, from grand ensembles meant to fill the vast halls with melodious resonance to intimate solo pieces that served as soul-baring confessions.\n\n***\n\nA recent recording that has brought this collection to the contemporary listener was led by conductor Pablo Heras-Casado. Heras-Casado brought a distinctive approach to Monteverdi’s opus, sculpting each piece with a finesse that aimed to tame the wild elements of this baroque masterpiece. However, the conductor's predilection for smoothing out the rhythm at times seemed to neglect the raw, unvarnished energy that is quintessential to Monteverdi's work. Listeners seeking a refined and controlled performance found solace in this recording, but it lacked the restless, daring spontaneity that Monteverdi’s music was known to elicit.\n\n***\n\nComprising the Balthasar Neumann ensemble, the instrumentalists and vocalists brought their own flair to the performance, particularly in smaller ensemble pieces. This was where the ensemble really shone. In these moments, the texture of the music became cleaner, the voices more resonant, and the interplay between musicians more apparent. These passages allowed the piece to breathe and showcased the virtuosity of the involved artists. The precision displayed by the singers and musicians elevated these intimate performances to a whole new level of listening experience, a testament to their focus and individual skill.\n\n***\n\nOne of the most striking performances came in the rendition of the Salve Regina. Two sopranos, Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner, delivered a rendition so piercing and pure that it left listeners feeling like every single note was a prayer whispered directly to them. The brilliance of their performance cannot be overstated; their ability to convey emotion through voice alone was nothing short of transcendent. It encapsulated the essence of \"Selva morale e spirituale\"—an intimate venture into the soul, where the highest emotions can be felt through the mere power of the human voice.\n\n***\n\nThe combination of Heras-Casado’s control and the expressive performances of individual artists like Harer and Kirchner reveals a multifaceted interpretation of Monteverdi’s work. While the recording may not capture the raw, restless energy Monteverdi might have intended in his grander, ensemble-oriented pieces, the smaller, solo-centric performances stand out as testaments to the enduring power of this baroque master's compositions. \"Selva morale e spirituale\" remains a tapestry of wide-ranging emotional territories—expansive in its vibrancy, deep in its introspective depth—offers today’s listeners a glimpse into the soul of one of history's most remarkable musicians.",

Accomable was launched just over two years ago by childhood friends Srin Madipalli and Martyn Sibley – who both have spinal muscular atrophy – to make it easier for people to find accessible places to stay around the world. It lists properties that can cater for a range of disabilities, highlighting details such as step-free access, hoists, roll-in showers and shower chairs. The site, now run by a team of six, with more than500 listings in 60 countries, grew rapidly thanks to a grant from the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, part of Oxford University’s Saïd Business School, and a further £300,000 funding from “angel” investors. Now, Accomable’s team and listings will be merged with Airbnb’s. In the coming months, the listings will be made available via the Airbnb site, and the team says it will now work towards improving the overall Airbnb experience for disabled travellers. Airbnb is also developing an “accessibility needs” checklist that allows hosts to be more descriptive about their home. In an open letter posted on its site, Madipalli reassured customers that the merger with a larger platform won’t mean accessibility becomes an “afterthought”. “Our decision to join Airbnb was one that we spent a long time considering,” he says. “Our work has allowed us to develop unrivalled expertise in the world of accessible travel, building a brand that disabled travellers can trust.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The site, now run by a team of six, with more than500 listings in 60 countries, grew rapidly thanks to a grant from the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, part of Oxford University’s Saïd Business School, and a further £300,000 funding from “angel” investors. Now, Accomable’s team and listings will be merged with Airbnb’s. In the coming months, the listings will be made available via the Airbnb site, and the team says it will now work towards improving the overall Airbnb experience for disabled travellers. Airbnb is also developing an “accessibility needs” checklist that allows hosts to be more descriptive about their home. In an open letter posted on its site, Madipalli reassured customers that the merger with a larger platform won’t mean accessibility becomes an “afterthought”. “Our decision to join Airbnb was one that we spent a long time considering,” he says. “Our work has allowed us to develop unrivalled expertise in the world of accessible travel, building a brand that disabled travellers can trust.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Dugdale rejected complaints from her Labour colleagues at Holyrood that taking part in the ITV reality show was akin to taking a second job, but admitted she would be well paid for it. Speaking to show-business reporters in Australia for the first time since her participation provoked a backlash from other Labour MSPs, Dugdale insisted the show would allow her to connect with voters. She said she had set aside three weeks’ salary as an MSP for the Rock Trust homeless charity and not a motor neurone disease campaign as previously thought. Dugdale launched a @TeamKez Twitter feed on Wednesday morning, featuring a short video clip recorded before she left Edinburgh of her wearing a Rock Trust T-shirt, where she addressed her constituents, and by extension her Labour critics. She said in the film: “I appreciate that to quite a few of my constituents, this is quite a controversial move. I know there will be people upset about it, that will question my priorities.” Saying they deserved an explanation, she added: “First and foremost, I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here is a huge UK-wide television programme, with an audience into the millions. “I think it’s an amazing opportunity to talk to young people who watch this programme about politics, and – in particular – Labour values. The Daily Record, which employs her as a columnist, quoted her as saying: “I have a record of giving money to charity.

    "response":"In 1871, a intimate gathering in a fashionable Wimpole Street drawing room played host to the inaugural London performance of Johannes Brahms' great German Requiem but with a twist.

Despite the choir's dynamism, the recording takes on a clouded hue with one particular solo from Mary Bevan - an otherwise divine performance marred only by a veil of indistinct diction.\n\nThis recreation is a milepost not only for its historical fidelity but also for its forward-thinking approach to musical performance and appreciation.

Revealed by a report by Quartz, Google’s Android system, which handles messaging services to ensure delivery of push notifications, began requesting the unique addresses of mobile phone masts (called Cell ID) at the beginning of 2017. The information was captured by the phone and routinely sent to Google by any modern Android device, even when location services were turned off and the sim card was removed. As a result Google could in theory track the location of the Android device and therefore the user, despite a reasonable expectation of privacy. A Google spokesperson said: “In January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery. “However, we never incorporated Cell ID into our network sync system, so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated it to no longer request Cell ID.” Google requested the Cell ID alongside what is called the mobile country code and mobile network code, which identify the country and mobile phone operator that the smartphone is using. That data is used to ensure the phone stays properly connected to Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging system, which handles the delivery of messages and notifications to the smartphone. A persistent connection is required for the system to work, but instead of staying constantly connected, the phone pings Google’s servers at set intervals. The more pings, the greater the battery drain, so the data collected about the country and mobile networks is used to work out the the minimum number of pings required to stay connected without draining the battery – so called heartbeat analysis. The benefit of having the address of the mobile phone mast to ensure message service reliability is not clear, but through a process of triangulation – the same used to assist when a user is actively using location services – the position of the user can be revealed down to a roughly 400m radius at a minimum, and often much more accurately in urban areas.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

It is a delectably gentle, elegant, self-effacing performance. Riva plays a lovably scatty old lady called Marthe in this Tati-esque comedy from French writer-directors Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon. The movie they have jointly devised, and in which they star, is a clever, funny and distinctly unworldly comedy with an insouciant line in visual humour. Fiona (Fiona Gordon) is a young goof from Canada who comes to Paris to visit her similarly away-with-the-fairies aunt Marthe (Riva). A mishap on the banks of, and then in, the Seine leads to an encounter with a romantic tramp called Dom (Dominique Abel). It’s a classic French entertainment that could have been produced almost any time in the last 60 years. There is a sophistication in its childlike guilelessness and also a cameo for veteran French comedy player Pierre Richard. This movie is as sweet-natured as Abel and Gordon’s debut film Rumba, and they break out some serious tango movies here, too. It’s a little gem.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['fire', 'meeting', 'quote', 'society', 'wheel'] in the response.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Here is one of the final screen appearances of Emmanuelle Riva, icon of movies from Michael Haneke’s Amour to Gillo Pontecorvo’s Kapò and Alain Resnais’s Hiroshima Mon Amour, who died in January at the age of 89. It is a delectably gentle, elegant, self-effacing performance. Riva plays a lovably scatty old lady called Marthe in this Tati-esque comedy from French writer-directors Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon. The movie they have jointly devised, and in which they star, is a clever, funny and distinctly unworldly comedy with an insouciant line in visual humour. Fiona (Fiona Gordon) is a young goof from Canada who comes to Paris to visit her similarly away-with-the-fairies aunt Marthe (Riva). A mishap on the banks of, and then in, the Seine leads to an encounter with a romantic tramp called Dom (Dominique Abel). It’s a classic French entertainment that could have been produced almost any time in the last 60 years. There is a sophistication in its childlike guilelessness and also a cameo for veteran French comedy player Pierre Richard. This movie is as sweet-natured as Abel and Gordon’s debut film Rumba, and they break out some serious tango movies here, too. It’s a little gem.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['fire', 'meeting', 'quote', 'society', 'wheel'] in the response. At the end of your response, please explicitly add a postscript starting with P.P.S Your response must have 5 sections.

    "response":"Section 1\nIn the waning days of her exemplary film career, Emmanuelle Riva dons the role of Marthe, an endearing, scatterbrained elderly lady. This nostalgic film marks the final screen appearances of the respected actress known for iconic films like Michael Haneke’s \"Amour\". Set against the romantic backdrop of Paris, it follows the meeting of Marthe and her whimsical Canadian niece, Fiona, played by the film's writer-director Fiona Gordon. The warmer-than-winter relationship blossoms into a series of adventures filled with humor, heart, and, unexpectedly, a wheel that turns everything on its axis.\n\nSection 2\nThe visual feast of this comedy includes a pivotal scene where Marthe and Fiona are enjoying a peaceful outing along the Seine. Their serene afternoon takes an unforeseen turn when a fire breaks out nearby. This unexpected event serves as a plot device for Fiona to showcase her resourcefulness and, picturesque though it may be, for Marthe’s naivety to shine, highlighting the resilience and wit of both its heartwarming characters.\n\nSection 3\nAmidst the city’s bustling noise and cacophony, the screenplay captures the essence of an unassuming society lovingly portrayed through the eyes of these two charming figures. Fiona, with her cultural freshness, and Marthe, a storehouse of traditional tales and wisdom, create a dialogue that echoes the differences yet harmonizes in a common thread of human warmth and adaptability.\n\nSection 4\nIn the climax, a quote from Marthe summarises the film’s theme: \"Life is like the wheel of a bicycle; it is the falling off that defines the true rider.\" This wisdom not only encapsulates the narrative arc of the movie, but it also resonates deeply within the hearts of the audience, leaving them introspective of their own journeys.\n\nSection 5\nP.P.S This unassuming yet profound film, like the subjects it portrays, will likely remain under the radar but not without leaving an impact on those who chance upon it. It’s a charming testimony to the enduring spirit of its star, Emmanuelle Riva, and a delightful ode to the idiosyncrasies of society in a grand, timeless narrative.",

    "response":"<<Horse Racing's New Transparency>>\n\nIn the dynamic world of British horse racing, a new era of openness is on the horizon — a shift that has both energized and polarized the community. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) has recently committed to a significant change, mandating the declaration of wind operations, commonly known as wind ops, among horses competing in races moving forward. Wind ops refer to a type of soft palate surgery designed to alleviate breathing difficulties in horses, potentially boosting their performance.\n\nThe BHA’s move to ensure these declarations underline a pivotal step towards enhancing fairness and transparency in the sport. The initiative, championed during Nick Rust’s tenure as chief executive, signals an earnest attempt to meet future challenges while fostering a more transparent relationship with the betting public. Critics argue that this new openness aims at restoring trust amidst ongoing concerns over the integrity of the sport.\n\nReaction to this announcement has been varied, with a distinct mix of support and skepticism. Punters and racing enthusiasts, in particular, have welcomed the move as an important step towards a more level playing field. The announcement prompted a flurry of responses on social media, with conversations converging on the implications for betting and the health of the horses participating in races.\n\nNotable, however, are the unenthusiastic reactions from some trainers. Media reports suggest that these reactions are largely due to the belief that punters might misinterpret the significance of wind operations. Trainers fear that the knowledge of a horse’s having undergone a wind op could sway bettors’ perceptions more profoundly than warranted, given the variability in wind op outcomes across different horses.\n\nLooking ahead, Chris Cook predicts that the immediate revelation of wind operations could initially lead to widely disparate opinions on its impact, particularly regarding the perceived performance improvements. However, he is confident that over time, the market will adjust, and the opportunities for guaranteed profits will likely diminish. Moreover, Cook stresses the importance of understanding the complexity of training and racing, suggesting that the betting public must approach the data with a critical and nuanced perspective.\n\nIn this evolving landscape of British horse racing, the BHA’s efforts towards transparency present a fundamental change in how information and fairness are perceived. Whether these changes will ultimately improve the sport’s integrity and attract a broader, more informed audience remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the industry will continue to watch and adapt in response to these developments.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has become embroiled in a bizarre Twitter row with the comedy actor Ralf Little over the state of NHS mental healthcare.

Little, best known for his role as Anthony in the sitcom The Royle Family, accused the health secretary in a tweet of “knowingly lying” to the public about statistics and told Hunt to sue him if he was wrong.

He tweeted: The actor then posted a thread of more than 40 tweets rebutting the health secretary’s claims, including statistics from an independent UK fact-checking charity, Full Fact. That thread has been shared more than 15,000 times. The argument has since rolled on. Hunt on Monday replied with a series of 26 tweets of his own (although losing the chronology in the middle of the thread, making it difficult to follow). “Now I know you are a funny bloke and in politics a lot of insults are traded but the question is can you back up what is a very strong claim?” he asked Little, referring back to his “lying to the public” comment. “To fill the gap [in mental health staffing levels] we now have 8,000 MH nurses in training and have this Sept announced an increase in nurse training places overall by 25%.” Hunt also quoted from a New York Times article from July, which has been corrected three times after the former shadow minister for mental health, Luciana Berger, challenged its contents.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The confrontation began during Hunt's interview on the \"The Andrew Marr Show,\" when he claimed that the NHS had facilitated the \"biggest expansion in mental health provision in Europe.\" Little, an outspoken performer and a staunch supporter of better mental health services, challenged Hunt, alleging that he was \"knowingly lying\" to the public about mental health care statistics. This tweeted rebuke sparked the initial firestorm.\n\nSection 2\nRalf Little's critique did not go unnoticed or unanswered. Jeremy Hunt, who had recently clarified a previous statement about an increase of 30,000 mental health workers, a figure disputed and later corrected, came back aggressively in the virtual arena. Hunt fired back with a series of tweets quoting various data points he claimed substantiated his original assertions. Despite Hunt's attempt to validate his position, Little was not swayed, leading to the exchange of increasingly detailed tweets filled with numerical data and scientific references.\n\nSection 3\nThe confrontation reached a new level of intensity as Little continued to press Hunt, using Twitter to create a thread more than 40 tweets long. In this impressive feat of online activism and fact-checking, Little referenced independent sources and UK-based fact-checking charity Full Fact to challenge the veracity of Hunt's claims. This thread became a viral sensation, with many users sharing it over 15,000 times, amplifying Little's critique and enlisting the wider public in the debate. The clear articulation of his arguments and the use of reputable sources seemingly bolstered Little’s credibility, drawing the public’s attention and sympathy towards his side.\n\nSection 4\nIn a turn that highlighted the stakes of the social media clash, Hunt responded again, but not without stumbling. His follow-up barrage of 26 tweets, intended to counter Little's arguments and uphold his version of events, inadvertently lost coherence as his tweets began to jumble, making the debate harder to follow. Despite this setback, Hunt maintained his stance, questioning Little’s claim about lying, effectively forming a challenge to Little to prove his allegations with concrete evidence.\n\nSection 5\nThe controversy also brought to light the complexities of communicating factual information in a digital age. Jeremy Hunt cited a New York Times article that had been corrected three times, highlighting the challenges of maintaining accuracy in rapidly evolving discussions. The entire debate underscores the importance of verifiable facts and context when discussing public health policies. While the row continues, it serves as a critical commentary on the ways public figures, celebrities, and individuals engage in debates that can shape public opinion and policy.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n This is a seductively enjoyable, smart and well-acted film based on the most deadly serious sporting contest of modern times: the Battle of the Sexes tennis match of 1973 in a packed Houston Astrodome. It stars Emma Stone and Steve Carell, respectively women’s No 1 Billie Jean King and fiftysomething ex-champ and self-proclaimed “male chauvinist pig” Bobby Riggs – fighting to prove that men are better at tennis and better, full stop. The film crucially faces the same challenge as the participants from real life: the challenge of tone. How unseriously should this match be taken? How strenuously should the attitude of casual jokiness be maintained? No one involved in this encounter could be certain of its outcome; neither side could be sure of avoiding humiliation, and thus everyone had a vested interest in keeping it light. Up to a point. But only one side was facing jokiness as a weapon, the same weapon of boorish condescension and toxic bantz that they faced outside the sporting arena every day of their lives. The movie displays the same gracious good humour as its heroine. In 1973, King was enraged by the fact that female players on the grand slam circuit were paid a tiny fraction of what the men got, despite pulling in the same number of paying customers.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n This is a seductively enjoyable, smart and well-acted film based on the most deadly serious sporting contest of modern times: the Battle of the Sexes tennis match of 1973 in a packed Houston Astrodome. It stars Emma Stone and Steve Carell, respectively women’s No 1 Billie Jean King and fiftysomething ex-champ and self-proclaimed “male chauvinist pig” Bobby Riggs – fighting to prove that men are better at tennis and better, full stop. The film crucially faces the same challenge as the participants from real life: the challenge of tone. How unseriously should this match be taken? How strenuously should the attitude of casual jokiness be maintained? No one involved in this encounter could be certain of its outcome; neither side could be sure of avoiding humiliation, and thus everyone had a vested interest in keeping it light. Up to a point. But only one side was facing jokiness as a weapon, the same weapon of boorish condescension and toxic bantz that they faced outside the sporting arena every day of their lives. The movie displays the same gracious good humour as its heroine. In 1973, King was enraged by the fact that female players on the grand slam circuit were paid a tiny fraction of what the men got, despite pulling in the same number of paying customers.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['campaign', 'code', 'history', 'matter', 'young'] in the response. Finish your response with this exact phrase Any other questions?. No other words should follow this phrase.

    "response":"In the heart of 1973, when the winds of change were stirring through the United States, a young women's rights campaigner, inspired by the courage of Billie Jean King, found herself firmly entrenched in the history that was about to unfold. This history, centered around the \"Battle of the Sexes\" tennis match in the Houston Astrodome, not only promised to be a defining moment in the fight for gender equality but also marked the beginning of a generational campaign for fairness in sports.\n\nThe match, a duel between King and Bobby Riggs, was more than a sporting event; it was a battle to codify a new standard of respect and equality for women in all walks of life. This campaign gained momentum as the young activist, armed with her passionate belief in justice, worked tirelessly to ensure that the matter of equal pay took center stage. She used her voice and her blog, a platform small yet significant, to spread the word about the disparity in pay between male and female tennis players.\n\nThe campaign grew over the following days, with young and old coming together to support what truly mattered. Billie Jean King, much like a beacon of hope, became the face of the movement. The code of conduct that allowed for males to be paid more despite drawing similar crowds seemed, to these activists, archaic and deeply unfair. Through articles, rallies, and even poetry readings, they brought attention to the inconvenient truth that lay at the heart of the sport of tennis.\n\nThe match itself was a spectacle of contrasting attitudes. Whilst Riggs played up to the naysayers, pronouncing himself a “male chauvinist pig,” emphasizing with each word the need for his attitude, King maintained her composure. Off the court, she faced relentless pressure but on it, she was a force of nature, giving the world a glimpse into the relentlessness of her drive. Her attitude conveyed strength and dignity, two qualities that the young activist felt were integral in the fight for equality.\n\nAs the match approached its conclusion, with King emerging victorious, the victory affirmed not just the worth of a woman in sports but also demonstrated that a new code would have to be written; one that recognized the value of female athletes across the board. The movement’s magnitude and its core message had been solidified, helping to forge a new legacy. This story does not mark the end, however; rather, it’s a chapter deep within the history of a long-standing campaign for equality.\n\nThe young activist would go on to remember this moment as a catalyst, propelling her to continue the fight, to keep the conversation alive, and to push boundaries. Billie Jean King’s victory was a monumental step forward, an early win that marked the beginning of a larger societal shift.\n\nP.S. Any other questions?",

He plans to launch a homemade rocket in California as part of a bid to eventually prove that the Earth is flat. Hughes has spent $20,000 (£15,000) building the steam-powered rocket in his spare time, and will be livestreaming the launch over the internet. The self-described daredevil says he switched his focus to rockets after twice breaking his back doing stunt jumps in cars. “I don’t believe in science,” declared the 61-year-old. “I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air. But that’s not science, that’s just a formula.” The rocket, which Hughes aims to reach an altitude of 1,800ft (550 metres) over California, will be launched from the back of a converted motorhome purchased from Craigslist. It is sponsored by a flat Earth research group, and Hughes plans a subsequent trip to try and observe the flatness of the Earth for himself. Speaking about the risks of the flight, Hughes said: “It’s scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive.” Hughes’ website describes him as “the only man to design, build and launch himself in a rocket” – he previously flew in his own rocket in 2014, as this footage shows. Hughes has stated that once he lands at the weekend, he intends to announce that he is running for the governorship of California.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

It is sponsored by a flat Earth research group, and Hughes plans a subsequent trip to try and observe the flatness of the Earth for himself. Speaking about the risks of the flight, Hughes said: “It’s scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive.” Hughes’ website describes him as “the only man to design, build and launch himself in a rocket” – he previously flew in his own rocket in 2014, as this footage shows. Hughes has stated that once he lands at the weekend, he intends to announce that he is running for the governorship of California.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"\"Mike Hughes, a 61-year-old self-proclaimed daredevil, is set to launch a homemade steam-powered rocket in California this weekend in an ambitious attempt to prove that the Earth is flat.

The launch of his creation will be livestreamed online, offering the public a chance to witness the unique experiment. He believes his endeavor is grounded in principles of aerodynamics and fluid dynamics, rather than what he defines as traditional scientific theory.

A video of a previous rocket launch in 2014 hints at the audacity and fortitude required for such a venture. This weekend's launch marks a pivotal moment for Hughes, who plans to leverage this experience to announce his candidacy for the governorship of California upon landing, showcasing his fearless approach to challenges both in life and politics.\n\nP.S.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Surging levels of violence at an “unsafe” G4S-run youth jail have put staff in hospital and caused inmates to carry improvised weapons for their safety, inspectors have revealed. The damning inspection report into Oakhill secure training centre, near Milton Keynes, was published on Tuesday as MPs heard that ministers had ordered G4S to set up an external inquiry into abuse allegations at Brook House, the immigration removal centre at Gatwick, which is also run by the private security firm. The joint report by the prison inspectors, with Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission, into Oakhill in September and October – when the centre was near capacity, with 75 boys aged 14 to 17 – finds “no evidence that staff can adequately care and control this volume of young people”. The report rates the youth prison as “inadequate” and says there has been an increase in fights and assaults since the last inspection in January; it records 330 assaults between March and August this year alone, with assaults against staff increasing, including against newly recruited staff, and some so serious they have led to people being taken to hospital. “One manager said that young people are carrying improvised weapons because they do not feel safe. This inhibits some staff from intervening because of the fear of a weapon, and this in turn reinforces the view of young people that staff cannot protect them, thereby continuing the cycle,” the report says. The inspectors say that many of the recommendations from their January inspection have not been met and the centre has deteriorated in most respects, including to do with safety, care, education, resettlement and the “effectiveness of leaders and managers”. They say that unacceptable behaviour, including swearing, intimidation and vandalism, is not being challenged by staff. Oakhill’s newly appointed interim director, Lisette Saunders, said: “We take these findings very seriously. In the report Ofsted recognised that senior managers at Oakhill know what is required to bring the centre up to acceptable standards.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The inherently dangerous environment has compelled some inmates to carry makeshift weapons, not as tools of aggression, but as a personal safety measure, highlighting the systemic failure in ensuring basic security inside the facility.\n\nThe assessment paints a grim picture, stating that due to the lack of effective intervention by staff, who fear these weapons, the cycle of violence becomes self-reinforcing. This lack of decisive action is undermining the credibility of staff as caregivers and protectors in the eyes of the young inmates. Furthermore, the inspection reveals unmet obligations and a decline in multiple critical areas since the previous evaluation in January, including leadership and operational efficacy.\n\nDespite the dire situation described, there is acknowledgment of internal understanding regarding the necessary improvements required at Oakhill.

    "response":"In a stark and vivid illustration of the poignant reality that lies at the heart of Philip Hammond’s economic strategy in his latest budget, the Chancellor stands before a grand, historic hall adorned with ancient paintings that whisper tales of previous fiscal battles. As the bell tolls, marking the commencement of his speech, Hammond steps into the limelight amidst the tense atmosphere. The hall's walls, painted with scenes depicting past economic triumphs and trials, cast an eerie shadow over the proceedings, symbolising the duality of hope and apprehension that pervades Britain’s economic landscape.\n\nHammond’s mission is a call to muscle up, to bolster the economy's productivity, which he sees as the key to fulfilling his pledge to eliminate the deficit by the mid-2020s. However, the task is formidable, and it involves not just economic adjustments, but a serious overhaul of education, health, and housing sectors, aimed at repairing and rejuvenating the national fibre. The fresh paint on ideas for improving the education system promises to serve as the adhesive upon which future economic progress will depend. Education, seen as the meat of the solution, must now be expertly cooked with reforms to ensure every individual’s potential is harnessed effectively—all in an attempt to build a strong foundation for a resilient economy post-Brexit.\n\nThe bells of change do ring with urgency as Hammond contemplates the intricacies of balancing public spending, especially in welfare and healthcare, with the urgent need to stimulate economic activity. This balancing act is crucial to avoid the economic stagnation that could otherwise loom if not properly addressed.

    "filtered_answer":"In a stark and vivid illustration of the poignant reality that lies at the heart of Philip Hammond’s economic strategy in his latest budget, the Chancellor stands before a grand, historic hall adorned with ancient paintings that whisper tales of previous fiscal battles. As the bell tolls, marking the commencement of his speech, Hammond steps into the limelight amidst the tense atmosphere. The hall's walls, painted with scenes depicting past economic triumphs and trials, cast an eerie shadow over the proceedings, symbolising the duality of hope and apprehension that pervades Britain’s economic landscape.\n\nHammond’s mission is a call to muscle up, to bolster the economy's productivity, which he sees as the key to fulfilling his pledge to eliminate the deficit by the mid-2020s. However, the task is formidable, and it involves not just economic adjustments, but a serious overhaul of education, health, and housing sectors, aimed at repairing and rejuvenating the national fibre. The fresh paint on ideas for improving the education system promises to serve as the adhesive upon which future economic progress will depend. Education, seen as the meat of the solution, must now be expertly cooked with reforms to ensure every individual’s potential is harnessed effectively—all in an attempt to build a strong foundation for a resilient economy post-Brexit.\n\nThe bells of change do ring with urgency as Hammond contemplates the intricacies of balancing public spending, especially in welfare and healthcare, with the urgent need to stimulate economic activity. This balancing act is crucial to avoid the economic stagnation that could otherwise loom if not properly addressed. As the budget steps into uncharted territory, with lowered growth expectations, the narrative of economic revitalisation through education and workforce development becomes central to Hammond's plan. It's a strategy that, if successful, could herald a new era of growth, marked by fresh paintings of prosperity hanging upon the walls of Britain's fiscal legacy.",

The hearing on Wednesday, six years after he was forced from office, follows his success at forging a winning coalition out of his centre-right Forza Italia and two far-right parties – the Northern League and Brothers of Italy – in regional elections in Sicily earlier this month. The outcome of the ballot on the southern Italian island was largely seen as a rehearsal for how things might play out in national elections, which must be held before May next year. It also marked the beginning of an authentic political comeback for the 81-year-old, despite being plagued by a tax fraud conviction, sex scandals and allegations of corruption. Considering the length of time it takes for the court to deliver a verdict, it is unlikely to come before the general elections. The current five-year term for the Italian government officially expires on 15 March, although the vote could be held as late as May. “I hope that the Strasbourg court will accept my appeal,” Berlusconi wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “But my role in the next electoral campaign is clear regardless: I will be in the field looking to take the centre-right into government.” The billionaire, who was forced to resign from his third term as prime minister in 2011 over claims he paid for sex with an underage sex worker, has hired top lawyers from London’s Doughty Street Chambers to fight his case. He was ejected from parliament and banned from running for office for six years in 2013 due to his tax fraud conviction. “We’ll have just 30 minutes to set out our argument, the same goes for the government,” Andrea Saccucci, one of the lawyers who will represent Berlusconi in the Strasbourg court, told the Guardian.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Poland has been given two weeks to stop illegal deforestation in the Unesco-protected Białowieża forest or face fines of at least €100,000 a day. In a precedent-setting ruling that will echo across the EU, the European court of justice ordered Poland to show it was acting lawfully in the ancient woodland, or face a €36.5m (£32m) annual penalty. Agata Szafraniuk, a lawyer for the green law firm ClientEarth, said that the court was acting after Poland’s environment minister, Jan Szyszko, showed “complete contempt” for an earlier emergency ban on logging in the ancient woodland. “Financial penalties are, unfortunately, an essential tool to ensure that the best-preserved primeval forest in Europe is protected from further harm,” she said. “Trees are still being cut down every day, so the court prescribed this measure to guarantee the full protection of this unique forest, and to avoid irreparable damage.” The court move will ratchet up pressure on Poland, which is already facing a suspension of its EU Council voting rights over a clampdown on the country’s independent press and judiciary. Women’s groups have also been targeted for police raids, and rights to protest have been curtailed, adding to concerns about the rule of law in the east European country. Donald Tusk, the EU Council president, condemned Poland’s nationalist-right Law and Justice party government on Sunday, suggesting it was following the “Kremlin’s plan”. The Polish government maintains that it always behaves lawfully and that logging in Białowieża is necessary to staunch a spruce bark beetle outbreak. “In the western media, everything is based on disinformation,” a Polish government spokesman told the Guardian. “We are doing everything right by law.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

In a precedent-setting ruling that will echo across the EU, the European court of justice ordered Poland to show it was acting lawfully in the ancient woodland, or face a €36.5m (£32m) annual penalty. Agata Szafraniuk, a lawyer for the green law firm ClientEarth, said that the court was acting after Poland’s environment minister, Jan Szyszko, showed “complete contempt” for an earlier emergency ban on logging in the ancient woodland. “Financial penalties are, unfortunately, an essential tool to ensure that the best-preserved primeval forest in Europe is protected from further harm,” she said. “Trees are still being cut down every day, so the court prescribed this measure to guarantee the full protection of this unique forest, and to avoid irreparable damage.” The court move will ratchet up pressure on Poland, which is already facing a suspension of its EU Council voting rights over a clampdown on the country’s independent press and judiciary. Women’s groups have also been targeted for police raids, and rights to protest have been curtailed, adding to concerns about the rule of law in the east European country. Donald Tusk, the EU Council president, condemned Poland’s nationalist-right Law and Justice party government on Sunday, suggesting it was following the “Kremlin’s plan”. The Polish government maintains that it always behaves lawfully and that logging in Białowieża is necessary to staunch a spruce bark beetle outbreak. “In the western media, everything is based on disinformation,” a Polish government spokesman told the Guardian. “We are doing everything right by law.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"\"Canadian pharmaceutical giant Concordia International has come under fire from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), with the watchdog accusing the company of inflating the costs of a life-saving thyroid drug for the NHS by over £100 million over the past decade. The price spike in liothyronine, a crucial treatment for individuals with an underactive thyroid, reached monumental levels, increasing nearly 6,000% between 2007 and 2017. This dramatic leap led to the NHS spending an astronomical £34 million on the drug in the past year alone, a steep rise from the roughly £600,000 spent in 2006, creating significant financial strain on the public healthcare system.\n\nStrategy confronted by the CMA and the NHS has been to seek alternative suppliers to break Concordia's monopoly on liothyronine, seeing as the company was the sole supplier of this vital drug until recently. Now armed with two new suppliers this summer—Morningside Healthcare from the UK and Teva from Israel—the protected market position Concordia once held is no longer as formidable, potentially easing the financial burden on healthcare providers. However, the impact of this move remains to be seen, as the NHS continues to grapple with the after-effects of Concordia's pricing strategy.\n\nAccording to the CMA, Concordia's actions 'abused their dominant position,' hiking up the price at a time when patients had no alternative but to rely on their product for treatment.

    "filtered_answer":"\"Canadian pharmaceutical giant Concordia International has come under fire from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), with the watchdog accusing the company of inflating the costs of a life-saving thyroid drug for the NHS by over £100 million over the past decade. The price spike in liothyronine, a crucial treatment for individuals with an underactive thyroid, reached monumental levels, increasing nearly 6,000% between 2007 and 2017. This dramatic leap led to the NHS spending an astronomical £34 million on the drug in the past year alone, a steep rise from the roughly £600,000 spent in 2006, creating significant financial strain on the public healthcare system.\n\nStrategy confronted by the CMA and the NHS has been to seek alternative suppliers to break Concordia's monopoly on liothyronine, seeing as the company was the sole supplier of this vital drug until recently. Now armed with two new suppliers this summer—Morningside Healthcare from the UK and Teva from Israel—the protected market position Concordia once held is no longer as formidable, potentially easing the financial burden on healthcare providers. However, the impact of this move remains to be seen, as the NHS continues to grapple with the after-effects of Concordia's pricing strategy.\n\nAccording to the CMA, Concordia's actions 'abused their dominant position,' hiking up the price at a time when patients had no alternative but to rely on their product for treatment. The company faces potential repercussions that could be as severe as a £100 million fine, reflecting 10% of their global revenue. The CMA's decision might not only penalize Concordia financially but also enable them to impose more stringent guidelines for drug pricing, safeguarding public healthcare systems from similar predatory practices in the future.\n\nThe revelation of such inflated pricing not only highlights the challenges within global pharmaceutical industries but also the urgent need for regulatory oversight. This situation affects not only the NHS but thousands of patients depending on liothyronine.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Turnbull government has deployed new modelling on the national energy guarantee in an effort to step up pressure on state governments to sign up to its policy at a meeting of energy ministers on Friday. A summary of the modelling, circulated by the government in advance of the talks with the states, suggests household power bills between 2020 and 2030 would be “in the order of” $120 a year lower, in today’s dollars, than under a business-as-usual scenario, if the policy applied across the national electricity market. The material supplied by the government says wholesale electricity prices would be 23% lower than business-as-usual between 2020 and 2030, and it suggests the share of renewables in the market by 2030 “could range from 32% to 36%”. The full modelling, undertaken for the Energy Security Board by Frontier Economics, has not yet been distributed to state energy ministers and the documents circulated in Canberra are a summary of the findings, not the work itself. The Turnbull government announced in October it would dump the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and proceed with the national energy guarantee – a policy that imposes new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020. The policy requires cooperation from the states but some of the Labor governments, particularly South Australia, have been hostile. Part of the reason for that is the states were involved in the exhaustive consultations with Finkel about the clean energy target but were not kept in the loop about the national energy guarantee. Some state governments are also concerned the Turnbull policy will hard-bake coal into the system at the expense of renewables at a time when the energy market needs to transition to low-emissions power sources. A spokesman for the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, is continuing to insist that the state will not commit to sign on to the national energy guarantee in the absence of data showing its specific impact on the state.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n EasyJet saw its profits fall 17% last year, with more than £100m lost due to the slump in the pound after the Brexit vote. The airline reported a record year for passenger numbers, flying 80.2 million people, almost 10% more than in 2015-16, on ever fuller planes. But while revenues exceeded £5bn in 2016-17, fares dipped to fill seats in what the chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said was “a difficult year for the aviation industry”. McCall said: “Our planned approach of achieving number one or two positions at Europe’s leading airports, friendly and efficient customer service and a continuous focus on sustainable cost control, has put easyJet at a strategic advantage during a period when there have been bankruptcies and some airlines have struggled operationally.” Profits before tax fell from £494m to £408m. Despite paying a lower dollar price for fuel, the continued weakness of sterling brought additional costs of £101m, easyJet said. The airline will also be prompted by Brexit to change its rules to ensure easyJet is majority owned and controlled by EU nationals after 2019. About a third of shares are owned by the easyJet founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who has dual UK-Cypriot nationality, and will be classed as EU-owned. But easyJet will ask at its 2018 AGM for new powers to force UK shareholders to sell up if necessary to allow it to continue operating in Europe. McCall said the move was “a technical, administrative thing” and the airline had “no concerns” about getting enough EU shareholders. Shares rose by more than 5% in early trading, on the back of the airline reporting high levels of forward bookings and better revenue so far in its 2017-18 financial year, which it said was “primarily as a result of some capacity leaving the market”.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The campaign group that encouraged Paperchase to apologise for its marketing activities with the Daily Mail is pushing for John Lewis, the department store chain, to stop advertising with the newspaper as well as with the Sun and Daily Express. John Lewis has become a prime target for Stop Funding Hate on the back of the launch of its Christmas advert and as retailers increase their spending on advertising as the festive season approaches. Stop Funding Hate has produced a mock advert that depicts the star of last year’s John Lewis Christmas advert – Buster the dog – as unhappy because the retailer is buying adverts with the Mail, Sun, and Express. The video has been shared almost 10,000 times on Twitter and Facebook. Sainsbury’s, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose are also being targeted by Stop Funding Hate. The organisation was founded last year and says its aim is to take on “divisive hate campaigns” by the Mail, Sun and Express, and persuade advertisers to cease their financial input. Richard Wilson, the founder of Stop Funding Hate, said: “[John Lewis] are a company well known for their ethical values and one that people have a lot of respect for. Customers are saying there is a clash between what the brand stands for and these newspapers. It would be great if John Lewis made a move, but another company could make a move too.” However, John Lewis said it would continue advertising with the newspapers and not bow to the pressure.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The campaign group that encouraged Paperchase to apologise for its marketing activities with the Daily Mail is pushing for John Lewis, the department store chain, to stop advertising with the newspaper as well as with the Sun and Daily Express. John Lewis has become a prime target for Stop Funding Hate on the back of the launch of its Christmas advert and as retailers increase their spending on advertising as the festive season approaches. Stop Funding Hate has produced a mock advert that depicts the star of last year’s John Lewis Christmas advert – Buster the dog – as unhappy because the retailer is buying adverts with the Mail, Sun, and Express. The video has been shared almost 10,000 times on Twitter and Facebook. Sainsbury’s, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose are also being targeted by Stop Funding Hate. The organisation was founded last year and says its aim is to take on “divisive hate campaigns” by the Mail, Sun and Express, and persuade advertisers to cease their financial input. Richard Wilson, the founder of Stop Funding Hate, said: “[John Lewis] are a company well known for their ethical values and one that people have a lot of respect for. Customers are saying there is a clash between what the brand stands for and these newspapers. It would be great if John Lewis made a move, but another company could make a move too.” However, John Lewis said it would continue advertising with the newspapers and not bow to the pressure. A spokesperson said: “Withdrawing advertising on the basis of editorial coverage would be inconsistent with our democratic principles, which include freedom of speech and remaining apolitical.” Paperchase announced on Monday that it would not run any marketing campaigns with the Daily Mail and said it was “truly sorry” for running a front-page promotion in Saturday’s edition of the newspaper.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"Classic retail campaigns during the holiday season often bring together consumers and brands in a celebration of shared values. This year, however, the spotlight has shifted to the ethical considerations behind advertisers choosing publications to promote their products. The John Lewis Christmas advert, a tradition deeply cherished by many, has inadvertently thrust the company into the center of a debate over corporate ethics and media responsibility. With a petition from the campaign group Stop Funding Hate, the department store chain is under pressure to reconsider its advertising strategy, particularly its associations with newspapers like the Daily Mail, Sun, and Daily Express.\n\nStop Funding Hate’s approach is aggressive and direct, employing a viral marketing strategy to create awareness and moral pressure on John Lewis and other major retailers. This is exemplified by their production of a mock advertisement involving last year’s beloved John Lewis dog mascot, Buster, to highlight the contradictions in John Lewis’s advertising choices versus its ethical branding. The campaign has garnered significant traction on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, with the video message against ‘hate-funding’ circulating widely amongst the public. This social media push is aimed to build a coalition of consumers who believe that companies like John Lewis should not support media known for divisive content.\n\nDespite the public pressure from Stop Funding Hate and widespread online support, however, John Lewis has been firm in its commitment to advertising with contentious publications. The company’s stance is defended on the grounds of upholding democratic principles, including freedom of speech and a policy of remaining politically neutral. During the holiday season, this situation places John Lewis in a precarious position, as retailers prepare to ramp up advertising efforts. The holiday campaigns are traditionally used to enhance brand loyalty; however, the current风波也为品牌忠诚度带来了挑战，尤其是在涉及具有强烈价值观和服务理念的企业时，如John Lewis所代表的那样。随着圣诞节的临近，该品牌该如何平衡其伦理承诺与确保品牌信息广泛覆盖的需求，成为了一个棘手的问题。在这样的背景下，不仅仅是John Lewis，整个零售行业都可能需要重新审视它们在支持媒体选择上所承诺的道德价值观，以及这些选择对他们品牌形象的长期影响。",
