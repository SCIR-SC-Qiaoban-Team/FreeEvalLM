      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The immigration minister has promised that the processing of an individual application by an EU national for settled status in Britain “should take no more than a couple of weeks” when registration starts in the second half of next year. The minister, Brandon Lewis, told the Commons home affairs select committee that an extra 1,200 UK visas and immigration staff were being recruited to process an expected 3.5m applications from EU nationals over two and a half years. He also told MPs on Tuesday that he was optimistic that an agreement could be struck by Christmas on the rights of EU citizens in the UK in the Brexit negotiations. However, he declined to comment on reports that the Brexit inner cabinet had decided on Monday that the European court of justice could continue to play a role in guaranteeing their rights during a two-year transition period. The Home Office minister did confirm that those refused “settled status” and classed as non-EU nationals in Britain illegally could have their bank accounts frozen and face deportation before the hearing of any appeal in British courts. The 3million group, representing EU nationals in Britain, immediately questioned Lewis’s claim that an agreement with the EU on “settled status” was likely before Christmas. “We wonder how. Major stumbling blocks still in place,” they tweeted, noting continued differences over the role of the ECJ, over family reunification rights that could affect thousands, and regarding clarification that they should not face “hostile environment measures”. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, voiced scepticism that an extra 1,200 staff – of whom 700 had already been recruited – would be sufficient when the UK Visas and Immigration agency (UKVI) currently used 6,500 staff to process 3m visa applications a year. There was already a three-month delay in processing EU nationals’ applications for permanent residence documents, she said.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n This is a bankrupt budget. Not in the strictly financial sense, though how much more threadbare core public services can become without collapsing and causing social mayhem the next few years will prove, if the government lasts. Even with faltering economic growth, public spending is to go on falling as a proportion of GDP. It’s bankrupt in ideas, in understanding, in preparedness to examine what has been happening to public services. Housing offers a glaring example. For all the bells and whistles in the budget, and some welcome augmentation of council powers, the government fails to make an obvious connexion. Building houses, allocating land, encouraging development, and policing the delinquency of private developers all imply an active and financially lubricated local government. Housing is and always will be about places, streets, brownfields – and public acceptance of schemes that will abut on their property or where they walk their dog. That’s what councillors do. Ace ideologue of the free market Oliver Letwin, of all people, can’t substitute.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n This is a bankrupt budget. Not in the strictly financial sense, though how much more threadbare core public services can become without collapsing and causing social mayhem the next few years will prove, if the government lasts. Even with faltering economic growth, public spending is to go on falling as a proportion of GDP. It’s bankrupt in ideas, in understanding, in preparedness to examine what has been happening to public services. Housing offers a glaring example. For all the bells and whistles in the budget, and some welcome augmentation of council powers, the government fails to make an obvious connexion. Building houses, allocating land, encouraging development, and policing the delinquency of private developers all imply an active and financially lubricated local government. Housing is and always will be about places, streets, brownfields – and public acceptance of schemes that will abut on their property or where they walk their dog. That’s what councillors do. Ace ideologue of the free market Oliver Letwin, of all people, can’t substitute.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky has died aged 55. The news was announced on his Facebook page: “On behalf of the Hvorostovsky family, it is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Dmitri Hvorostovsky – beloved operatic baritone, husband, father, son, and friend – at age 55. After a two-and-a-half-year battle with brain cancer, he died peacefully this morning, November 22, surrounded by family near his home in London, UK. May the warmth of his voice and his spirit always be with us.” Hvorostovsky was born in a tough industrial city in Siberia, telling an interviewer in 2002 that as a high school student, prison looked a more likely destination than the opera stage, with “drinking, drugs and fighting,” part of his adolescence. A teenage obsession with pop music also almost claimed the singer for a different world, and his hard drinking and wild behaviour continued into his 20s and early 30s. He came to international attention in 1989 when he beat Bryn Terfel to win the Cardiff Singer of the World title. With his prematurely white hair, dashing good looks and powerful stage presence, his heartthrob image was carefully cultivated and he amassed legions of fans. A career performing in all the major opera houses and concert halls followed, and he was hailed one of the world’s greatest baritones for the rich, expressive fluidity of his voice. His fame allowed him to bring the neglected and little known Russian song repertoire into western halls, most notably with the remarkable accompanist Ivari Ilja. In the opera house he was particularly feted for his performances of Verdi, and also his charismatic and provocative interpretation of Tchaikovksy’s antihero Eugene Onegin, a role he made his own.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The news was announced on his Facebook page: “On behalf of the Hvorostovsky family, it is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Dmitri Hvorostovsky – beloved operatic baritone, husband, father, son, and friend – at age 55. After a two-and-a-half-year battle with brain cancer, he died peacefully this morning, November 22, surrounded by family near his home in London, UK. May the warmth of his voice and his spirit always be with us.” Hvorostovsky was born in a tough industrial city in Siberia, telling an interviewer in 2002 that as a high school student, prison looked a more likely destination than the opera stage, with “drinking, drugs and fighting,” part of his adolescence. A teenage obsession with pop music also almost claimed the singer for a different world, and his hard drinking and wild behaviour continued into his 20s and early 30s. He came to international attention in 1989 when he beat Bryn Terfel to win the Cardiff Singer of the World title. With his prematurely white hair, dashing good looks and powerful stage presence, his heartthrob image was carefully cultivated and he amassed legions of fans. A career performing in all the major opera houses and concert halls followed, and he was hailed one of the world’s greatest baritones for the rich, expressive fluidity of his voice. His fame allowed him to bring the neglected and little known Russian song repertoire into western halls, most notably with the remarkable accompanist Ivari Ilja. In the opera house he was particularly feted for his performances of Verdi, and also his charismatic and provocative interpretation of Tchaikovksy’s antihero Eugene Onegin, a role he made his own.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Philip Hammond must borrow an extra £90bn over the next five years after the Treasury’s independent forecaster downgraded productivity growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that the chancellor faced a long period of lower than expected wages growth that would dent tax receipts and push up borrowing. The cumulative effect over the life of the parliament would add £90.5bn to the UK’s debt pile and jeopardise Hammond’s target of balancing the government’s books by 2025, it said. The Treasury said that once the positive effects of an increase in employment and better than expected borrowing over the last year are taken into account, the net borrowing rise would be £35bn, putting the chancellor in a position to reach his target of creating a surplus in the middle of the next decade. But some analysts said the OBR’s revision failed to go far enough and it continued to overestimate the capacity of British businesses to invest in new equipment and processes to drive up productivity. They argued that the forecaster should have gone further and predicted that productivity growth – which measures the average output per hour worked – of almost zero over the last seven years would continue for another five years. Joanna Davies, a UK economist at Fathom Consulting, said the OBR’s new forecast that productivity would increase at a rate of 1.1% until 2022 – almost half the 2.1% average seen in the 30 years before 2007 – still looked ambitious. She said the prospects for GDP growth would suffer a severe knock-on effect from lower productivity and a rapidly ageing population. “Over the last five years, productivity growth has averaged just 0.3%,” she said. “Combined with UN projections for working-age population growth, the UK’s trend rate of overall economic growth is probably somewhere in the range 0.5%-1% – around half the 1.5% assumed by the OBR.” The OBR chair, Robert Chote, said GDP growth would not only be hit by lower productivity, but also a weaker than expected export sector that would fail to benefit significantly from the lower pound.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Describing some of the reporting on the vote as “weird and dishonest”, Tory MP Zac Goldsmith tweeted a clarification that the vote had been about the correct legal procedure for ensuring animal welfare standards – not on the principle of whether animals are sentient. Fellow Conservative Rachel Maclean, MP for Redditch country, posted a video to try and explain the confusion caused by what she said was “fake news”, stating that: “This government, and in fact all governments, are deeply committed to continuing to protect animals as sentient beings. That law is already written into our own law.” Theresa May said at Wednesday’s PMQs: “We recognise and respect that animals are sentient beings, and should be treated accordingly.” Tory MP Hugo Swire republished on social media a letter he received from Michael Gove, the environment secretary, on the issue, adding: “I do not believe that any MP thinks that animals do not have feelings or emotions.” Nevertheless, the vote has triggered protests from animal rights groups, including multiple online petitions aimed at the House of Lords, UK parliament and Gove. Public figures including the presenter Sue Perkins have voiced strong criticism of MPs over the issue. Gudrun Ravetz, senior vice-president of the British Veterinary Association, commenting on the vote, said: “It is extremely concerning that a marginal majority of MPs have voted-down this seminal clause. This action undermines the government’s previous promises that the UK will continue to be known for our high standards of animal health and welfare post-Brexit.” However, Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley, pointed out that EU law still allowed many practices across Europe that animal rights groups oppose. The amendment, proposed by the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas, among others, had set out to specifically incorporate article 13 of title II of the Lisbon treaty into UK law. During debate on the amendment last Wednesday, Lucas pointed out that the origins of the clause began with the 1997 UK presidency of the EU and that from 1999 EU law had explicitly recognised that animals were sentient life forms.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"In a dense and vibrant chapter of early Baroque music, a 1640 collection titled \"Malinconia e Spirituale Bosco\" (which translates to \"Moral and Spiritual Forest\") emerges as a testament to Claudio Monteverdi's enduring genius. This remarkable 1640 collection was born from Monteverdi's tenure as maestro di cappella at St Mark’s Basilica in Venice, a position he held for over three decades. During his time in this role, he crafted a sound world that was as luxurious as the basilica's interior, with its sumptuous acoustics and an accompanying ensemble that included a crack instrumental band and a choir of 40 voices, complementing each other perfectly. ***\n\nAt the heart of this collection, one finds a stunning variety of musical forms, ranging from majestic ensemble pieces to more intimate and personal confessional moments. This duality provides a rich tapestry of sound that captivates the listener. However, British conductor Pablo Heras-Casado's approach to conducting these works has been described as somewhat controlling, with an inclination to shape the larger pieces into finely tuned, if somewhat smooth and traffic-controlled, arrangements. This style, while professional and precise, sometimes fails to capture the rough spontaneity that many listeners deem essential in Monteverdi's work. ***\n\nNonetheless, the individual performances within the collection are nothing short of dazzling. The ensemble at the Balthasar Neumann label shine in their nimble duos and trios, especially in pieces like the piercingly delivered \"Salve Regina,\" performed by sopranos Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner. Their vocal agility and powerful delivery bring a fresh immediacy to these works, breathing life into each note and enhancing the authenticity of Monteverdi's vision. Despite the conductor's tendency to over-shape the larger works, the individual brilliance of the musicians and singers ensures that this collection remains a worthy exploration of Monteverdi's early Baroque essence. ***\n\nThis combination of controlled grandeur and spontaneous intimacy creates an engaging listening experience that highlights the evolution of Monteverdi's style over his long tenure at St Mark’s Basilica. The collection serves not only as a nostalgic look back at one of music's most influential periods but also as a testament to the enduring ability of individual musicians to lend their unique voices to a larger, collective sound. As listeners immerse themselves in the intricate and dynamic interplay of voice and instrument, they are reminded of the profound impact that Monteverdi had on the development of Western music. ***\n\nOverall, \"Malinconia e Spirituale Bosco\" stands as a fascinating snapshot of Monteverdi's artistry, a collection that balances the grandeur of its ensemble pieces with the subtle beauty of its more personal confessions. The performances by the Balthasar Neumann ensemble under the direction of Pablo Heras-Casado offer an intimate and accessible gateway into this seminal period of musical history, ensuring that the spirit and essence of Monteverdi's work continue to resonate with new generations of listeners.",

From his work with the renowned jazz pianists Misha Mengelberg and Paul Bley, to his embrace of Schubert’s songs, Honing's career is a testament to his musical depth and experience. His newest release, a seven-part suite dedicated to European integration, showcases his ability to blend these diverse influences into a cohesive and profound statement.\n\nThe suite, much like Honing’s earlier works, takes a subdued yet resonant approach. With his saxophone notes coloring in ruminative themes, Honing employs a patient and rich tonal palette, creating a sound reminiscent of Jan Garbarek’s work. However, beneath this surface, the music is vibrant with hidden spontaneity and ideas. \n\nIn collaboration with pianist Wolfert Brederode, bassist Gulli Gudmundsson, and long-time drummer Joost Lijbaart, Honing’s music gains a dimension of interplay and creativity that adds a layer of complexity. Each musician’s contribution is subtle yet significant, constantly offering quiet suggestions and steering the sax lines in unexpected directions. For instance, in Part I, a bass pulse gently pushes against the plaintive theme, while in Part II, small but strategic tweaks to the rocking piano vamp add depth. Part IV, inspired by the grandeur of Wagner and Richard Strauss, sees Brederode shadowing Honing’s deep, whispery sound, creating a rich and intricate mood.\n\nThis suite is not just an homage to past masters but a reflection of Honing’s own vision and seriousness. While it might appeal particularly to fans of Garbarek’s and Tord Gustavsen’s music, it stands on its own as a work of originality and thoughtfulness.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has promised to donate part of her fee from appearing in I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here to a homeless charity as she defended her decision to appear in the show. Dugdale rejected complaints from her Labour colleagues at Holyrood that taking part in the ITV reality show was akin to taking a second job, but admitted she would be well paid for it. Speaking to show-business reporters in Australia for the first time since her participation provoked a backlash from other Labour MSPs, Dugdale insisted the show would allow her to connect with voters. She said she had set aside three weeks’ salary as an MSP for the Rock Trust homeless charity and not a motor neurone disease campaign as previously thought. Dugdale launched a @TeamKez Twitter feed on Wednesday morning, featuring a short video clip recorded before she left Edinburgh of her wearing a Rock Trust T-shirt, where she addressed her constituents, and by extension her Labour critics. She said in the film: “I appreciate that to quite a few of my constituents, this is quite a controversial move. I know there will be people upset about it, that will question my priorities.” Saying they deserved an explanation, she added: “First and foremost, I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here is a huge UK-wide television programme, with an audience into the millions. “I think it’s an amazing opportunity to talk to young people who watch this programme about politics, and – in particular – Labour values. The Daily Record, which employs her as a columnist, quoted her as saying: “I have a record of giving money to charity. This isn’t a second job, this is three weeks out of my work.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Entire output should be wrapped in JSON format.

Dugdale rejected complaints from her Labour colleagues at Holyrood that taking part in the ITV reality show was akin to taking a second job, but admitted she would be well paid for it. Speaking to show-business reporters in Australia for the first time since her participation provoked a backlash from other Labour MSPs, Dugdale insisted the show would allow her to connect with voters. She said she had set aside three weeks’ salary as an MSP for the Rock Trust homeless charity and not a motor neurone disease campaign as previously thought. Dugdale launched a @TeamKez Twitter feed on Wednesday morning, featuring a short video clip recorded before she left Edinburgh of her wearing a Rock Trust T-shirt, where she addressed her constituents, and by extension her Labour critics. She said in the film: “I appreciate that to quite a few of my constituents, this is quite a controversial move. I know there will be people upset about it, that will question my priorities.” Saying they deserved an explanation, she added: “First and foremost, I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here is a huge UK-wide television programme, with an audience into the millions. “I think it’s an amazing opportunity to talk to young people who watch this programme about politics, and – in particular – Labour values. The Daily Record, which employs her as a columnist, quoted her as saying: “I have a record of giving money to charity.

    "response":"In the lush Victorian era of 1871, a small gathering convened in a fashionable drawing room on London’s Wimpole Street. Scant weeks earlier, Johannes Brahms had passed away, but his deep and stirring German Requiem had left an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of those present. The music, in its vernacular form, was a bold statement of art and patriotism, its somber yet hopeful nature breaking through the industry and convention of the time.\n\nAs the years rolled by, a dedicated group of performers, driven by a sense of reverence and legacy, decided to honor Brahms by introducing his hymn to the world in the language the composer himself loved—English. They chose to use the original piano (four hands) accompaniment, a rare and intimate touch that entwined the music with the very essence of Brahms’s artistry. This rendition, carefully orchestrated to capture the nuances of Brahms’s orchestration, produced a highly charged chamber performance. The setting was set, and the expected performance promised to be a superb showcase of musical empathy and artistry.\n\nHowever, as the evening approached, a small issue arose. The choir, although young, sang with a bright quality that brought a sense of energy and vitality to the piece. Nonetheless, the clarity of their diction was occasionally marred. Particularly disappointing was the solo from Mary Bevan, a voice initially divinely melodic, until her enunciation became clouded with moisture or perhaps doubt, tainting the otherwise divine performance. This flaw, despite the rest of the ensemble’s excellence, left a blemish in what was otherwise a magnificent meditation.\n\nThe gathering on Wimpole Street in 2023 captured the spirit of those first performances over a century ago, blending the old and the new in a way that paid homage to Brahms’s ideals. Despite the imperfections, the performance remained a testament to the enduring power of music to bridge time and space, connecting the present with the past.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Google has confirmed it has been able to track the location of Android users via the addresses of local mobile phone masts, even when location services were turned off and the sim cards removed to protect privacy. Revealed by a report by Quartz, Google’s Android system, which handles messaging services to ensure delivery of push notifications, began requesting the unique addresses of mobile phone masts (called Cell ID) at the beginning of 2017. The information was captured by the phone and routinely sent to Google by any modern Android device, even when location services were turned off and the sim card was removed. As a result Google could in theory track the location of the Android device and therefore the user, despite a reasonable expectation of privacy. A Google spokesperson said: “In January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery. “However, we never incorporated Cell ID into our network sync system, so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated it to no longer request Cell ID.” Google requested the Cell ID alongside what is called the mobile country code and mobile network code, which identify the country and mobile phone operator that the smartphone is using. That data is used to ensure the phone stays properly connected to Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging system, which handles the delivery of messages and notifications to the smartphone. A persistent connection is required for the system to work, but instead of staying constantly connected, the phone pings Google’s servers at set intervals. The more pings, the greater the battery drain, so the data collected about the country and mobile networks is used to work out the the minimum number of pings required to stay connected without draining the battery – so called heartbeat analysis. The benefit of having the address of the mobile phone mast to ensure message service reliability is not clear, but through a process of triangulation – the same used to assist when a user is actively using location services – the position of the user can be revealed down to a roughly 400m radius at a minimum, and often much more accurately in urban areas.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

It is a delectably gentle, elegant, self-effacing performance. Riva plays a lovably scatty old lady called Marthe in this Tati-esque comedy from French writer-directors Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon. The movie they have jointly devised, and in which they star, is a clever, funny and distinctly unworldly comedy with an insouciant line in visual humour. Fiona (Fiona Gordon) is a young goof from Canada who comes to Paris to visit her similarly away-with-the-fairies aunt Marthe (Riva). A mishap on the banks of, and then in, the Seine leads to an encounter with a romantic tramp called Dom (Dominique Abel). It’s a classic French entertainment that could have been produced almost any time in the last 60 years. There is a sophistication in its childlike guilelessness and also a cameo for veteran French comedy player Pierre Richard. This movie is as sweet-natured as Abel and Gordon’s debut film Rumba, and they break out some serious tango movies here, too. It’s a little gem.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['fire', 'meeting', 'quote', 'society', 'wheel'] in the response.

Riva plays a lovably scatty old lady called Marthe in this Tati-esque comedy from French writer-directors Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon. The movie they have jointly devised, and in which they star, is a clever, funny and distinctly unworldly comedy with an insouciant line in visual humour. Fiona (Fiona Gordon) is a young goof from Canada who comes to Paris to visit her similarly away-with-the-fairies aunt Marthe (Riva). A mishap on the banks of, and then in, the Seine leads to an encounter with a romantic tramp called Dom (Dominique Abel). It’s a classic French entertainment that could have been produced almost any time in the last 60 years. There is a sophistication in its childlike guilelessness and also a cameo for veteran French comedy player Pierre Richard. This movie is as sweet-natured as Abel and Gordon’s debut film Rumba, and they break out some serious tango movies here, too. It’s a little gem.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['fire', 'meeting', 'quote', 'society', 'wheel'] in the response. At the end of your response, please explicitly add a postscript starting with P.P.S Your response must have 5 sections.

    "response":"Section 1\nEmmanuelle Riva, celebrated for her roles in iconic films such as \"Amour,\" \"Kapò,\" and \"Hiroshima Mon Amour,\" captured the essence of a lovably scatty old lady named Marthe in a charming comedy. This film, directed by Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon, has its roots firmly embedded in the rich tapestry of French cinema. A mishap befalls Fiona (played by Fiona Gordon) and Marthe by the Seine, leading them to meet a romantic tramp named Dom. The movie blends sophisticated humor with childlike guilelessness, much like Riva's earlier performances.\n\nSection 2\nThe film showcases a classic French entertainment, reminiscent of the idyllic cinema of Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Jacques Tati. An unexpected turn in the story involves a serious tango performance, which adds an intriguing dimension to the narrative. The directorial duo succeeds in crafting a film that is both sweet-natured and clever, reflecting the enduring appeal of French cinema across different eras.\n\nSection 3\nIn the quaint streets of Paris, where Marthe and Fiona find themselves, they encounter not just Dom but a world filled with whimsical and heartfelt moments. Their journey is a reflection of society's capacity to adapt and find joy, even in unexpected situations. The story serves as a reminder that, much like a well-tuned wheel, our lives should run smoothly and be full of unexpected pleasures and discoveries.\n\nSection 4\nOne memorable quote from the film becomes a prophetic metaphor for the theme: \"When you find something worth living for, you have to live.\" It encapsulates the essence of the film's influence on viewers, encouraging them to appreciate the simple pleasures in life and find joy wherever it may be lurking. The scene where the character bursts into tango music, turning a simple European excursion into a dance of joy, resonates deeply with the film's message.\n\nSection 5\nIn the postscript of this narrative, we honor the legacy of Emmanuelle Riva, whose final screen appearance was nothing short of enchanting. As she played Marthe, the lovable scatty old lady, we are reminded of the profound effect that filmmaker Abel and Gordon sought to capture—childlike wonderment intertwined with an unworldly grace. P.P.S. This elegant blend of charm and depth continues to resonate, illustrating the enduring power of cinema to reflect and inspire.",

Commentators and trainers have responded with mixed reactions, with some expressing concern that horse owners or trainers might be seen as less knowledgeable if the public understands the intricacies of wind ops.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has become embroiled in a bizarre Twitter row with the comedy actor Ralf Little over the state of NHS mental healthcare. The standoff began two weeks ago after Hunt’s appearance on The Andrew Marr Show, when Hunt stated that the NHS had overseen “the biggest expansion of mental health provision in Europe”. Little, best known for his role as Anthony in the sitcom The Royle Family, accused the health secretary in a tweet of “knowingly lying” to the public about statistics and told Hunt to sue him if he was wrong. Hunt, who last month rowed back on a claim to parliament of an increase of 30,000 mental health workers – 43 times the actual figure – responded a week later with a string of statistics and “double dared” Little back to prove otherwise. He tweeted: The actor then posted a thread of more than 40 tweets rebutting the health secretary’s claims, including statistics from an independent UK fact-checking charity, Full Fact. That thread has been shared more than 15,000 times. The argument has since rolled on. Hunt on Monday replied with a series of 26 tweets of his own (although losing the chronology in the middle of the thread, making it difficult to follow). “Now I know you are a funny bloke and in politics a lot of insults are traded but the question is can you back up what is a very strong claim?” he asked Little, referring back to his “lying to the public” comment. “To fill the gap [in mental health staffing levels] we now have 8,000 MH nurses in training and have this Sept announced an increase in nurse training places overall by 25%.” Hunt also quoted from a New York Times article from July, which has been corrected three times after the former shadow minister for mental health, Luciana Berger, challenged its contents.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

On February 13th, Hunt addressed the matter during his appearance on The Andrew Marr Show, where he pronounced that the NHS had achieved \"the biggest expansion of mental health provision in Europe.\" However, this statement quickly became a subject of contention due to differing perspectives on the statistics and actual resources allocated.\n\nSection 2\nReacting to this statement, Ralf Little, a well-known English actor from the comedy series The Royle Family, publicly challenged Hunt's assertion. In a tweet, Little accused Hunt of \"knowingly lying\" to the public regarding the statistics related to mental health services. The actor's tweet implored Hunt to pursue legal action if he could not substantiate his claim, setting the stage for an online showdown between the two public figures.\n\nSection 3\nIn response to Little's challenge, Hunt took the opportunity to provide his own set of statistics. Notably, a week after Little's initial tweet, Hunt launched a series of tweets aimed at proving his point, which he referred to as a \"double dare\" against the actor. In these tweets, Hunt brought up the state of mental health staffing, stating that 8,000 mental health nurses were currently in training, and that there would be a 25% increase in overall nurse training places.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n This is a seductively enjoyable, smart and well-acted film based on the most deadly serious sporting contest of modern times: the Battle of the Sexes tennis match of 1973 in a packed Houston Astrodome. It stars Emma Stone and Steve Carell, respectively women’s No 1 Billie Jean King and fiftysomething ex-champ and self-proclaimed “male chauvinist pig” Bobby Riggs – fighting to prove that men are better at tennis and better, full stop. The film crucially faces the same challenge as the participants from real life: the challenge of tone. How unseriously should this match be taken? How strenuously should the attitude of casual jokiness be maintained? No one involved in this encounter could be certain of its outcome; neither side could be sure of avoiding humiliation, and thus everyone had a vested interest in keeping it light. Up to a point. But only one side was facing jokiness as a weapon, the same weapon of boorish condescension and toxic bantz that they faced outside the sporting arena every day of their lives. The movie displays the same gracious good humour as its heroine. In 1973, King was enraged by the fact that female players on the grand slam circuit were paid a tiny fraction of what the men got, despite pulling in the same number of paying customers.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n This is a seductively enjoyable, smart and well-acted film based on the most deadly serious sporting contest of modern times: the Battle of the Sexes tennis match of 1973 in a packed Houston Astrodome. It stars Emma Stone and Steve Carell, respectively women’s No 1 Billie Jean King and fiftysomething ex-champ and self-proclaimed “male chauvinist pig” Bobby Riggs – fighting to prove that men are better at tennis and better, full stop. The film crucially faces the same challenge as the participants from real life: the challenge of tone. How unseriously should this match be taken? How strenuously should the attitude of casual jokiness be maintained? No one involved in this encounter could be certain of its outcome; neither side could be sure of avoiding humiliation, and thus everyone had a vested interest in keeping it light. Up to a point. But only one side was facing jokiness as a weapon, the same weapon of boorish condescension and toxic bantz that they faced outside the sporting arena every day of their lives. The movie displays the same gracious good humour as its heroine. In 1973, King was enraged by the fact that female players on the grand slam circuit were paid a tiny fraction of what the men got, despite pulling in the same number of paying customers.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"In the bustling streets of Houston, the 'Battle of the Sexes' was not just about a tennis match but a historical campaign to challenge deeply rooted stereotypes and biases. Emma Stone, playing the role of Billie Jean King, emerged as the embodiment of the code that Championed women's rights throughout the 1970s. The match itself was a pivotal moment in the history of sports and gender equality. For many, it wasn't just a spectacle but a matter of self-respect and a significant step towards women's rights and recognition.\n\nThe movie's tone, while navigated with a light touch, was a striking reflection of the era’s tension and the struggle for acceptance. The film's creators had to balance the film's assailants, the casual jokiness and the serious undercurrents of sexism, ensuring that the audience was captivated without being patronized. The MESSAGE of the movie was clear; it was a struggle against the code of toxic masculinity and the battle for equality.\n\nEmma Stone's character, Billie Jean King, was a symbol of grace and determination, her victory not just in the tennis court but in the battle for pay equity. The film portrayed the young upstarts' determination to break the mold and change the code that had been imposed on women. It highlighted the way in which the pay gap was a matter of more than just money; it was a matter of basic human dignity and respect.\n\nThe movie was a celebration of the young generation’s reforms, their fight, and their unyielding spirit to challenge the established order. From the way the press treating women players like lesser beings to the incessant sexist comments from Riggs, the film became a reflection of the times. The 'Battle of the Sexes' was indeed a matter of more than just who could hit a ball across a net; it was a matter of who could change the world.\n\nThe film chronicled the history of how long the sport of tennis had been dominated by men, and how Billie Jean King was instrumental in breaking down these barriers. Her victory wasn't just a tennis victory; it was a cultural victory. The movie was a testament to her bravery and the courage of those who stood with her. There were moments of levity, yes, but they were carefully woven into the fabric of a determination to shine a light on a serious matter – the unequal treatment of women in sports and beyond.\n\nIn the end, King's victory was not just a personal triumph but a call to action for a generation. It was a reminder that the battle for equality was not just a matter for the past or the present; it was a pressing challenge for every young soul ready to take a stand. Any other questions?\n\nP.S. The film beautifully captured the essence of the early feminist movement and its impact on future generations.",

    "response":"Theater has the remarkable ability to bring forgotten memories to life, and in this instance, a powerful play by Natal’ya Vorozhbit serves as a vivid reminder of the conflicts that have raged in Ukraine, especially in Crimea. The play, translated by Sasha Dugdale, encapsulates the personal and harrowing journey of women caught in the crossfire of war. Natal’ya, a writer based in Kiev, takes the audience through a series of vignettes that each encapsulate a different facet of the war’s impact, but it is her own experience that becomes the most poignant story. \"In 2015, one year after the siege of Donetsk airport, I embarked on a research trip to the conflict zone,\" Natal’ya begins her story with a sense of dreadful familiarity. \"I was trying to understand the psychology of these so-called heroes, men who had willingly enlisted in the fight against separatists, but I was also battling my own demons.\"\n\nThe first vignette, which is the most impactful, is the segment where the fictionalized version of Natal’ya meets a military escort. This enthusiastic man, she shares, seemed to embody everything she had been taught about heroism and patriotism. \"At the time, I was easily swayed by the glamour of war, the sense of purpose and glory it promised,\" she recalls, her voice tinged with regret and sorrow. \"But as we delved deeper into the war zone, I witnessed the brutality firsthand, and it seared into my consciousness. The men who might have been my idealized heroes were now reduced to stumbling, maimed corpses. I struggled with the guilt of my attraction and the knowledge of the darkness I had almost embraced.\"\n\nThe rest of the play delves into the lives of other women caught up in the war. Teenage girls eager to find solace or companionship in the chaos of military camps, a devastated medic finding fragments of hope in moving a loved one's remains, and a young journalist fighting a dual battle against the enemy and her own captor. Each vignette, while stark and brutal, also reveals the human stories behind the headlines, the quiet moments of tenderness and despair amidst overwhelming destruction.\n\nThis play is a testament to the enduring impact of theater in bringing the personal into the public sphere, reminding us that wars are not just about geopolitical battles but human stories of love, loss, and survival. ******\n\nThe theater's ability to resurrect memories and emotions is as poignant as it is powerful. \"Theatre can sometimes jolt the memories,\" says Sasha Dugdale, who translated the play from Russian. \"This is not just a historical recounting; it’s personal and tragic, exploring the complexities of womanhood and heroism in the face of war.” The six vignettes, crafted by Natal'ya Vorozhbit, paint a nuanced picture of the conflict, examining the motivations and fates of women who find themselves entangled in its chaos.\n\nThe play’s narrative is perhaps most compelling in its first segment, where a fictionalized version of the playwright herself narrates a trip to the war zone. \"I was captivated by the men of the Russian army for their heroism, their willingness to fight,\" Natal’ya, who took on the role of her fictional self in the play, explains. \"Yet, I learned the hard way that their heroism is often hollow, their bravery misplaced in a war where survival and morality are dubious luxuries.\"\n\nThe following scenes provide more insight into the war’s psychological and physical toll. A young medic loses her composure as she moves her lover's remains, a teenage girl waits with untold hope for soldiers who will never return, and a journalist outwits her captor only to find herself questioning the very cause she was fighting for. Vorozhbit's portrayal of the soldiers reveals a mix of incompetence and necessity, conflicting with the romanticized notions of martial valor.\n\nWhile the play is a powerful narrative, it also leaves the audience with questions about the complexity of the war's political underpinnings. \"I wished for a deeper dive into the political motivations that led to this war,\" addresses the critic, highlighting the gaps in the play’s clinical portrayal. Despite this, the play’s personal testimonies underscore the profound human impact of the conflict, challenging readers to scrutinize their own perceptions of war and heroism.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Science is littered with tales of visionaries who paid for pioneering research to prove their theories, and this weekend “Mad” Mike Hughes is hoping to join them. He plans to launch a homemade rocket in California as part of a bid to eventually prove that the Earth is flat. Hughes has spent $20,000 (£15,000) building the steam-powered rocket in his spare time, and will be livestreaming the launch over the internet. The self-described daredevil says he switched his focus to rockets after twice breaking his back doing stunt jumps in cars. “I don’t believe in science,” declared the 61-year-old. “I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air. But that’s not science, that’s just a formula.” The rocket, which Hughes aims to reach an altitude of 1,800ft (550 metres) over California, will be launched from the back of a converted motorhome purchased from Craigslist. It is sponsored by a flat Earth research group, and Hughes plans a subsequent trip to try and observe the flatness of the Earth for himself. Speaking about the risks of the flight, Hughes said: “It’s scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive.” Hughes’ website describes him as “the only man to design, build and launch himself in a rocket” – he previously flew in his own rocket in 2014, as this footage shows. Hughes has stated that once he lands at the weekend, he intends to announce that he is running for the governorship of California.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The self-described daredevil says he switched his focus to rockets after twice breaking his back doing stunt jumps in cars. “I don’t believe in science,” declared the 61-year-old. “I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air. But that’s not science, that’s just a formula.” The rocket, which Hughes aims to reach an altitude of 1,800ft (550 metres) over California, will be launched from the back of a converted motorhome purchased from Craigslist. It is sponsored by a flat Earth research group, and Hughes plans a subsequent trip to try and observe the flatness of the Earth for himself. Speaking about the risks of the flight, Hughes said: “It’s scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive.” Hughes’ website describes him as “the only man to design, build and launch himself in a rocket” – he previously flew in his own rocket in 2014, as this footage shows. Hughes has stated that once he lands at the weekend, he intends to announce that he is running for the governorship of California.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Surging levels of violence at an “unsafe” G4S-run youth jail have put staff in hospital and caused inmates to carry improvised weapons for their safety, inspectors have revealed. The damning inspection report into Oakhill secure training centre, near Milton Keynes, was published on Tuesday as MPs heard that ministers had ordered G4S to set up an external inquiry into abuse allegations at Brook House, the immigration removal centre at Gatwick, which is also run by the private security firm. The joint report by the prison inspectors, with Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission, into Oakhill in September and October – when the centre was near capacity, with 75 boys aged 14 to 17 – finds “no evidence that staff can adequately care and control this volume of young people”. The report rates the youth prison as “inadequate” and says there has been an increase in fights and assaults since the last inspection in January; it records 330 assaults between March and August this year alone, with assaults against staff increasing, including against newly recruited staff, and some so serious they have led to people being taken to hospital. “One manager said that young people are carrying improvised weapons because they do not feel safe. This inhibits some staff from intervening because of the fear of a weapon, and this in turn reinforces the view of young people that staff cannot protect them, thereby continuing the cycle,” the report says. The inspectors say that many of the recommendations from their January inspection have not been met and the centre has deteriorated in most respects, including to do with safety, care, education, resettlement and the “effectiveness of leaders and managers”. They say that unacceptable behaviour, including swearing, intimidation and vandalism, is not being challenged by staff. Oakhill’s newly appointed interim director, Lisette Saunders, said: “We take these findings very seriously. In the report Ofsted recognised that senior managers at Oakhill know what is required to bring the centre up to acceptable standards.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The actor and Oscar-winning director, who has faced repeated damaging allegations of racist and misogynistic behaviour, said: “Things got shaken up a little bit and there is a lot of light being thrown into places where there were shadows and that is kind of healthy. It’s painful, but I think pain is a precursor to change.” Gibson was speaking while promoting his latest film, Daddy’s Home 2, his first family comedy in more than a decade after he was convicted of driving under the influence. He pleaded no contest to a misdemeanour battery charge in 2011 against his former girlfriend and mother of his child, Oksana Grigorieva. In 2010, it was reported that tapes had been submitted to the courts of Gibson allegedly using racist language and threatening to kill Grigorieva. He is also alleged to have said she deserved a beating. In one of the most notorious incidents involving the actor and director, Gibson unleashed an antisemitic rant in 2006 against a police officer in Malibu, California, who had pulled him over for drunk driving. He accused Jews of being responsible for “all the wars in the world”. He was convicted of driving under the influence.

Stephen Martin, director general of the business group, is to issue the ultimatum to the government at the IoD annual dinner on Tuesday, saying “all we want for Christmas is progress on Brexit”. He will say the time would come soon when the IoD may have to advise all of its members to be ready for no deal and urged the government to stop this outcome. “We know from our recent surveys that over half of you are already in the process of contingency planning,” Martin will say. “The number of businesses who have actually implemented these plans is currently low, around one in 10, but this will snowball if we don’t find out soon what is going to happen in March 2019. “It’s clear that the government has a small window of opportunity between now and the end of the first quarter of next year to secure a firm political agreement on transition. If we don’t have this commitment by the end of March, then business will come under pressure to implement contingency plans, even perhaps as far as relocating operations.” He will say companies supported the idea of a transitional period after March 2019 to help the UK and rest of the EU adjust to Brexit, but they needed to know that cross-border trade would effectively remain unchanged. Martin will say that businesses do not want to move to World Trade Organisation rules as it would be a “huge drop down from where we are now” but may soon have to start planning for that possibility. “WTO is not the simple option, it would involve massive complexity to adjust our customs procedures, and we would lose not just our level of access to the single market, but also potentially all of the trade and investment agreements we have with other countries through the EU,” he will say. “It’s not desirable, but it is possible.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"Ministers and analysts have gathered in London’s City for Philip Hammond’s first budget statement since the June general election, marking a significant moment as the UK economy tries to navigate the post-Brexit landscape. In a speech that will be closely scrutinized by financial markets and classrooms across the country, Hammond will attempt to bridge the gap between the government’s pledge to eliminate the UK’s deficit by the mid-2020s and the pressing issues in public services, welfare provision, and the housing market, which has effectively locked many young people out of home ownership. Among the many challenges, the economy’s productivity remains a key focus, with improvements required to meet ambitious fiscal targets.\n\nThe mood in the Treasury was one of cautious optimism as analysts prepared their projections for the budget, with one source likening the situation to the silent bell ringing in a classroom after a significant exam. Analysts expect to hear more about how the government plans to address the economy's stagnation, which has seen the UK grow by 1.7% in 2016 but by only 0.5% in the first half of this year, a development that has dampened confidence in the sector. In particular, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is expected to lower its GDP growth projections, stemming from concerns over the economic headwinds created by Britain's departure from the European Union.\n\nAmidst these economic challenges, Hammond needs to secure support on Capitol Hill, a reference to the House of Commons, for measures that will bolster productivity and improve the nation's chances of reaching its fiscal goals. However, he must tread carefully, as the economy’s performance, in part, hinges on the health of the services and manufacturing sectors, which will be closely watched. Education and painting, traditionally seen as key to economic growth, have been highlighted by experts as areas where support could be most effective, with education improving the skills of the workforce and painting contributing to infrastructure that supports businesses.\n\nOne of the more contentious points will be the funding for public services, which will need significant support to withstand cuts and maintain quality. There are also whispers of a meat shortage, a scenario reminiscent of muscle memory, where the body automatically recalls how to respond to a stressor, indicating a potential impact on the agricultural and food sectors. The government will be closely watched to see if it can provide additional resources to ensure a stable food supply, particularly as the self-employed face increased national insurance contributions, a move that sparked uproar at the March budget.\n\nAs the budget speech is about to unfold, eyebrows will be raised over how the government plans to address the looming welfare provision crisis, where the safety net for the most vulnerable is under threat. The budget must strike a balance between fiscal responsibility and social welfare, ensuring that the most marginalized in society are not left behind. The final piece of the puzzle, a stable housing market that doesn’t lock generations out of the opportunity to own a home, rests on a combination of economic strategy and political will, both of which will be tested in this landmark budget presentation.",

The government will be closely watched to see if it can provide additional resources to ensure a stable food supply, particularly as the self-employed face increased national insurance contributions, a move that sparked uproar at the March budget.\n\nAs the budget speech is about to unfold, eyebrows will be raised over how the government plans to address the looming welfare provision crisis, where the safety net for the most vulnerable is under threat. The budget must strike a balance between fiscal responsibility and social welfare, ensuring that the most marginalized in society are not left behind. The final piece of the puzzle, a stable housing market that doesn’t lock generations out of the opportunity to own a home, rests on a combination of economic strategy and political will, both of which will be tested in this landmark budget presentation.",

The hearing on Wednesday, six years after he was forced from office, follows his success at forging a winning coalition out of his centre-right Forza Italia and two far-right parties – the Northern League and Brothers of Italy – in regional elections in Sicily earlier this month. The outcome of the ballot on the southern Italian island was largely seen as a rehearsal for how things might play out in national elections, which must be held before May next year. It also marked the beginning of an authentic political comeback for the 81-year-old, despite being plagued by a tax fraud conviction, sex scandals and allegations of corruption. Considering the length of time it takes for the court to deliver a verdict, it is unlikely to come before the general elections. The current five-year term for the Italian government officially expires on 15 March, although the vote could be held as late as May. “I hope that the Strasbourg court will accept my appeal,” Berlusconi wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “But my role in the next electoral campaign is clear regardless: I will be in the field looking to take the centre-right into government.” The billionaire, who was forced to resign from his third term as prime minister in 2011 over claims he paid for sex with an underage sex worker, has hired top lawyers from London’s Doughty Street Chambers to fight his case. He was ejected from parliament and banned from running for office for six years in 2013 due to his tax fraud conviction. “We’ll have just 30 minutes to set out our argument, the same goes for the government,” Andrea Saccucci, one of the lawyers who will represent Berlusconi in the Strasbourg court, told the Guardian.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Poland has been given two weeks to stop illegal deforestation in the Unesco-protected Białowieża forest or face fines of at least €100,000 a day. In a precedent-setting ruling that will echo across the EU, the European court of justice ordered Poland to show it was acting lawfully in the ancient woodland, or face a €36.5m (£32m) annual penalty. Agata Szafraniuk, a lawyer for the green law firm ClientEarth, said that the court was acting after Poland’s environment minister, Jan Szyszko, showed “complete contempt” for an earlier emergency ban on logging in the ancient woodland. “Financial penalties are, unfortunately, an essential tool to ensure that the best-preserved primeval forest in Europe is protected from further harm,” she said. “Trees are still being cut down every day, so the court prescribed this measure to guarantee the full protection of this unique forest, and to avoid irreparable damage.” The court move will ratchet up pressure on Poland, which is already facing a suspension of its EU Council voting rights over a clampdown on the country’s independent press and judiciary. Women’s groups have also been targeted for police raids, and rights to protest have been curtailed, adding to concerns about the rule of law in the east European country. Donald Tusk, the EU Council president, condemned Poland’s nationalist-right Law and Justice party government on Sunday, suggesting it was following the “Kremlin’s plan”. The Polish government maintains that it always behaves lawfully and that logging in Białowieża is necessary to staunch a spruce bark beetle outbreak. “In the western media, everything is based on disinformation,” a Polish government spokesman told the Guardian. “We are doing everything right by law.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

In a precedent-setting ruling that will echo across the EU, the European court of justice ordered Poland to show it was acting lawfully in the ancient woodland, or face a €36.5m (£32m) annual penalty. Agata Szafraniuk, a lawyer for the green law firm ClientEarth, said that the court was acting after Poland’s environment minister, Jan Szyszko, showed “complete contempt” for an earlier emergency ban on logging in the ancient woodland. “Financial penalties are, unfortunately, an essential tool to ensure that the best-preserved primeval forest in Europe is protected from further harm,” she said. “Trees are still being cut down every day, so the court prescribed this measure to guarantee the full protection of this unique forest, and to avoid irreparable damage.” The court move will ratchet up pressure on Poland, which is already facing a suspension of its EU Council voting rights over a clampdown on the country’s independent press and judiciary. Women’s groups have also been targeted for police raids, and rights to protest have been curtailed, adding to concerns about the rule of law in the east European country. Donald Tusk, the EU Council president, condemned Poland’s nationalist-right Law and Justice party government on Sunday, suggesting it was following the “Kremlin’s plan”. The Polish government maintains that it always behaves lawfully and that logging in Białowieża is necessary to staunch a spruce bark beetle outbreak. “In the western media, everything is based on disinformation,” a Polish government spokesman told the Guardian. “We are doing everything right by law.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

While the NHS spent a mere £600, 000 on the drug in 2006, this figure escalated to more than £34m in 2017, with the price per pack climbing from £4. 46 in 2007 to a staggering £258. 19 by July 2017. This strategic overpricing, according to the CMA, was not driven by normal market conditions but rather by Concordia's leverage in a market where the company was, until recently, the sole supplier. Concordia could face a fine of up to 10% of its worldwide annual turnover for these practices. The situation has recently improved, as the UK firm Morningside Healthcare and Israel’s Teva were granted licenses to supply the drug, providing a much-needed competitive market in what was once a monopolistic field.",

A summary of the modelling, circulated by the government in advance of the talks with the states, suggests household power bills between 2020 and 2030 would be “in the order of” $120 a year lower, in today’s dollars, than under a business-as-usual scenario, if the policy applied across the national electricity market. The material supplied by the government says wholesale electricity prices would be 23% lower than business-as-usual between 2020 and 2030, and it suggests the share of renewables in the market by 2030 “could range from 32% to 36%”.

In 1998, the year before she retired, Novotná became only the fifth female player to pass the $10m mark in career prize money and in the same year was within reach of being ranked No 1 in the world. As an athlete she was among the best of her era, possessed of consummate skill in the dying and difficult art of serve-and-volley and an ability to deliver a backhand smash that was the envy of her peers. And yet in her 14 years at the top of the women’s game she won only 24 tour singles titles. Even more disappointingly, she reached the last eight in 22 of the 50 grand slam singles events in which she competed but managed to convert that consistency into just one title. The American player and commentator Pam Shriver, who was a good friend, explained this by saying that Novotná was “as kind as she was athletic”. Others, mostly tennis writers such as myself, put it more brutally: she was a choker. Novotná herself said she hated the idea of choking, preferring instead to say that she “got a little tight”. Her most famous episode of getting a little tight is now a case study for sports psychologists. It came in the 1993 Wimbledon final when she led Steffi Graf 6-7, 6-1, 4-1, and at 40-30 in the sixth game of the deciding set had a service point for a 5-1 lead over the German.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Even more disappointingly, she reached the last eight in 22 of the 50 grand slam singles events in which she competed but managed to convert that consistency into just one title. The American player and commentator Pam Shriver, who was a good friend, explained this by saying that Novotná was “as kind as she was athletic”. Others, mostly tennis writers such as myself, put it more brutally: she was a choker. Novotná herself said she hated the idea of choking, preferring instead to say that she “got a little tight”. Her most famous episode of getting a little tight is now a case study for sports psychologists. It came in the 1993 Wimbledon final when she led Steffi Graf 6-7, 6-1, 4-1, and at 40-30 in the sixth game of the deciding set had a service point for a 5-1 lead over the German.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Additionally, she stood on the verge of rising to the number one ranking in the world, an achievement no Czech woman had previously attained.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n EasyJet saw its profits fall 17% last year, with more than £100m lost due to the slump in the pound after the Brexit vote. The airline reported a record year for passenger numbers, flying 80.2 million people, almost 10% more than in 2015-16, on ever fuller planes. But while revenues exceeded £5bn in 2016-17, fares dipped to fill seats in what the chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said was “a difficult year for the aviation industry”. McCall said: “Our planned approach of achieving number one or two positions at Europe’s leading airports, friendly and efficient customer service and a continuous focus on sustainable cost control, has put easyJet at a strategic advantage during a period when there have been bankruptcies and some airlines have struggled operationally.” Profits before tax fell from £494m to £408m. Despite paying a lower dollar price for fuel, the continued weakness of sterling brought additional costs of £101m, easyJet said. The airline will also be prompted by Brexit to change its rules to ensure easyJet is majority owned and controlled by EU nationals after 2019. About a third of shares are owned by the easyJet founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who has dual UK-Cypriot nationality, and will be classed as EU-owned. But easyJet will ask at its 2018 AGM for new powers to force UK shareholders to sell up if necessary to allow it to continue operating in Europe. McCall said the move was “a technical, administrative thing” and the airline had “no concerns” about getting enough EU shareholders. Shares rose by more than 5% in early trading, on the back of the airline reporting high levels of forward bookings and better revenue so far in its 2017-18 financial year, which it said was “primarily as a result of some capacity leaving the market”.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"<<Transforming Horizons>>\n\nSection 1\nIn the ever-changing winds of the aviation industry, EasyJet, led by Chief Executive Carolyn McCall, navigated through a financially turbulent yet passenger-friendly year. Recognized as the king of punctuality and efficiency, EasyJet reported a record 80.2 million passengers, an impressive 10% more than in 2015-16, despite the challenges posed by Brexit and the subsequent pound depreciation. However, this journey was not without its complexities; the airline faced a 17% decline in profits to £408m, a fallout of nearly £101m extra costs due to the fall in the pound. This resulted in fares dipping, serving as a testament that it’s a 'difficult year for the aviation industry.'\n\nSection 2\nWith the looming specter of Brexit, EasyJet strategized to ensure its operational integrity and competitiveness in the EU. A potential threat arose when EasyJet may no longer be majority owned by EU nationals beyond 2019, due to Stelios Haji-Ioannou's dual UK-Cypriot nationality, with one-third of shares posed to become EU-owned. To navigate this risk, McCall proposed an ingenious yet simple solution, namely to remit power at the 2018 AGM, enforcing a mechanism to facilitate easyJet's operations by encouraging UK shareholders to sell their shares. A successful implementation of this move could very well solidify EasyJet's position within the European aviation market.\n\nSection 3\nIn the face of uncertainty and rapidly transforming society, EasyJet's proactive stance on staying relevant and adaptable shines like a beacon. Reflecting broader societal trends, the challenge for EasyJet is to maintain its allure and service excellence, much like a tower standing tall amidst the rough seas. In doing so, EasyJet exemplifies the ongoing journey of challenging the norm, akin to reeling in a big catch while ensuring the integrity of the structure, much like a dare to the fishing society. This quarter’s high-level bookings and improved revenue suggest that EasyJet is not just weathering but thriving in the turbulent seas of the aviation world.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The campaign group that encouraged Paperchase to apologise for its marketing activities with the Daily Mail is pushing for John Lewis, the department store chain, to stop advertising with the newspaper as well as with the Sun and Daily Express. John Lewis has become a prime target for Stop Funding Hate on the back of the launch of its Christmas advert and as retailers increase their spending on advertising as the festive season approaches. Stop Funding Hate has produced a mock advert that depicts the star of last year’s John Lewis Christmas advert – Buster the dog – as unhappy because the retailer is buying adverts with the Mail, Sun, and Express. The video has been shared almost 10,000 times on Twitter and Facebook. Sainsbury’s, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose are also being targeted by Stop Funding Hate. The organisation was founded last year and says its aim is to take on “divisive hate campaigns” by the Mail, Sun and Express, and persuade advertisers to cease their financial input. Richard Wilson, the founder of Stop Funding Hate, said: “[John Lewis] are a company well known for their ethical values and one that people have a lot of respect for. Customers are saying there is a clash between what the brand stands for and these newspapers. It would be great if John Lewis made a move, but another company could make a move too.” However, John Lewis said it would continue advertising with the newspapers and not bow to the pressure. A spokesperson said: “Withdrawing advertising on the basis of editorial coverage would be inconsistent with our democratic principles, which include freedom of speech and remaining apolitical.” Paperchase announced on Monday that it would not run any marketing campaigns with the Daily Mail and said it was “truly sorry” for running a front-page promotion in Saturday’s edition of the newspaper.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The campaign group that encouraged Paperchase to apologise for its marketing activities with the Daily Mail is pushing for John Lewis, the department store chain, to stop advertising with the newspaper as well as with the Sun and Daily Express. John Lewis has become a prime target for Stop Funding Hate on the back of the launch of its Christmas advert and as retailers increase their spending on advertising as the festive season approaches. Stop Funding Hate has produced a mock advert that depicts the star of last year’s John Lewis Christmas advert – Buster the dog – as unhappy because the retailer is buying adverts with the Mail, Sun, and Express. The video has been shared almost 10,000 times on Twitter and Facebook. Sainsbury’s, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose are also being targeted by Stop Funding Hate. The organisation was founded last year and says its aim is to take on “divisive hate campaigns” by the Mail, Sun and Express, and persuade advertisers to cease their financial input. Richard Wilson, the founder of Stop Funding Hate, said: “[John Lewis] are a company well known for their ethical values and one that people have a lot of respect for. Customers are saying there is a clash between what the brand stands for and these newspapers. It would be great if John Lewis made a move, but another company could make a move too.” However, John Lewis said it would continue advertising with the newspapers and not bow to the pressure. A spokesperson said: “Withdrawing advertising on the basis of editorial coverage would be inconsistent with our democratic principles, which include freedom of speech and remaining apolitical.” Paperchase announced on Monday that it would not run any marketing campaigns with the Daily Mail and said it was “truly sorry” for running a front-page promotion in Saturday’s edition of the newspaper.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Do not include keywords ['bottle', 'district', 'general', 'stroke', 'tap'] in the response. There should be 3 paragraphs. Paragraphs and only paragraphs are separated with each other by two new lines as if it was '\\n\\n' in python. Paragraph 1 must start with word classic.",
    "response":"Classic British values and ethical considerations are at the heart of the latest controversy in the advertising world. A campaign group known as Stop Funding Hate, founded last year, has intensified its efforts to persuade major retailers to advertise exclusively with newspapers it deems less \"divisive.\" The organization, which has already pushed Paperchase to issue an apology for its recent marketing campaign with the Daily Mail, is now targeting John Lewis, the department store chain, and other retail giants like Sainsbury’s, Marks & Spencer, and Waitrose. Following the launch of John Lewis’s Christmas advertisement and with the festive season approaching, the group has produced a mock advert depicting Buster the dog, the star of last year’s John Lewis Christmas campaign, as unhappy due to the retailer’s involvement with the Mail, Sun, and Express.\n\nThe campaign group's strategy involves leveraging social media to spread awareness and pressure. Their mock advert, which has been shared almost 10,000 times on Twitter and Facebook, is meant to reflect customer sentiment and highlight a perceived clash between John Lewis’s ethical values and its advertising practices. Richard Wilson, the founder of Stop Funding Hate, emphasizes John Lewis’s well-known commitment to ethical standards and the respect it commands from consumers, stating that it would be \"great if John Lewis made a move, but another company could make a move too.\" Despite the campaign's urging, John Lewis stands firm in its advertising strategy, arguing that withdrawing advertising based on editorial coverage would contradict its democratic principles, which include freedom of speech and political neutrality.",
