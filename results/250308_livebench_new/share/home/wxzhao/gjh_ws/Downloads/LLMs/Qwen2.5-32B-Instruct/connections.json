Limit and bill can be related as limits often measure the amount of something, and bill can mean a quantity or count of something.\n\n3. **fur, egg, curb, check**: Here we have a more abstract grouping, but one could be made based on the idea of containment or protection. Fur protects an animal's skin, an egg contains an embryo, curb can mean to restrain or control, and check in the sense of a financial document can be seen as a contained and secure form of currency transfer.\n\nSo, the items in groups sharing concepts of expansion, duration, and containment respectively would be:\n\n**venom, stretch, spell, contain, time, limit, period, bill, fur, egg, curb, check**",

I’ll analyze the list step-by-step:\n\n1. **Bounty, dip, honey, and carter**:\n   - These share a common feature related to food or storage. \"Bounty\" and \"honey\" are distinctly food-related. \"Dip\" can be a food dip as well. \"Carter\" could represent someone who transports goods, including food.\n\n2. **Bridge, queen, king, and duel**:\n   - This group can be associated with the game of chess. \"Bridge\" is not typically chess-related, but the others—queen, king, and duel—are heavily linked to a chess game as these are chess pieces and a form of contest typical in chess settings.\n\n3. **Tutu, spelling, busy, and saloon**:\n   - This one is trickier. \"Tutu\" is an item of clothing, \"spelling\" is about language skills, \"busy\" can be seen as an activity, and \"saloon\" is a place. To find a common theme, we can notice that all these words have at least 4 letters, but to be more specific, they are words that might be seen as items or concepts in a word game such as Scrabble (each term has interesting placement or scoring potential). \n\n4. **Gore, crunch, squat, and cowboy**:\n   - This might seem diverse, but \"gore\" could refer to the flesh of meat in a terrifying scene, akin to violence. \"Squat\" is a physical action, and \"crunch\" could be crushing something, again related to physical action. \"Cowboy\" might suggest a certain ruggedness or rough manual work action. All sorts of physical or brutal themes might unite these.\n\nConsidering the specific constraints about our groups, let’s review the items within these themes more tightly:\n\n- **Bounty, dip, honey, and carter** (all relate to food or moving goods).\n- **Bridge, queen, king, and duel** (elements from chess).\n- **Tutu, busy, saloon, and spelling** (potential words in Scrabble, non-physical common factor).\n- **Gore, crunch, squat, and cowboy** (physical actions or thematic violence).\n\nGiven emphasis on a \"best fit\", the solution might be closer to these:\n\n**bounty, dip, honey, carter, bridge, queen, king, duel, tutu, busy, saloon, spelling, gore, crunch, squat, cowboy**\n\nThe best suited thematic representation, given distinct groupings:",

Revisiting, if \"hairy\" is excluded, \"kneel\" fits perfectly with \"outage, surge, spike\" as actions or events.\n\n**Kneel, surge, spike, outage** is confirmed as a movement\/action-based group.\n\n**Buy, swallow, digest, believe** as actions of taking in.\n\n\"Abstract, outline, accept\" seems more conceptually aligned, making \"wane\" a potential outlier, but still grouped as conceptual actions.\n\nWith these categorizations:\n\n1. **Short, Curt, Brief:** Length or duration descriptors.\n2. **Kneel, surge, spike, outage:** Event or action descriptors.\n3. **Buy, Swallow, Digest, Believe:** Taking in actions.\n4. **Abstract, Outline, Accept, Wane:** General conceptual actions.\n\nThus, putting them all together in the correct order:\n\n**bold short, curt, brief, hairy, kneel, surge, spike, outage, buy, swallow, digest, believe, abstract, outline, accept, wane**",
