      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Here is a portrait of the primatologist as a young woman.

These are some of the questions posed by Goat, the raw, funny and occasionally searing new piece of dance theatre that Ben Duke has made for Rambert.

Then as the group divide into individual solos, contorting their bodies into expressions of private feeling, he trails after the dancers, hoping for elucidation. One of them, her limbs tied into an agonised knot, explains breathlessly that she’s dancing about the “stigma of addiction”. Another, his eyes rolling back in his head with exertion, says he’s expressing a sense of betrayal.

    "response":"Section 1\nThe news article from The Guardian discusses a dance performance titled \"Goat,\" created by Ben Duke for the Rambert dance company. It explores how dancers convey real emotions through movements and performances, questioning how they connect personal feelings to art. The piece is a blend of humor and serious emotion, making viewers think about the deeper meanings of dance expressions.\n\nSection 2\nThe performance is set in an open space, somewhere between a gathering place and a performance stage. The dancers and musicians act out a larger ritual, maybe healing or cathartic in nature. A character, a reporter named Miguel Altunaga, adds humor to the scene by commenting on the dancers' routines in an exaggerated fashion.\n\nSection 3\nThe journalist describes the energy and emotions portrayed by the different dancers in various sections of the piece. Each dancer demonstrates personal stories or struggles through their contorted movements, ranging from addiction to feelings of betrayal. This approach humorously exaggerates common clichés in interpretive dance, making fun of the often dramatic explanations dancers provide for their work.\n\nSection 4\nHowever, as the piece progresses, the tone shifts from lighthearted humor to a more somber, revealing exploration of personal stories and struggles. This transition helps the audience understand that while the humor is a tool to engage and entertain, there’s an underlying message about the depth of emotion and personal experiences dancers share through their performances on stage.\n\nSection 5\nIn summary, \"Goat\" uses the file of dance performance to explore the garden of human emotions, showcasing both the humorous and the deeply personal. It's a message about the power and difficulty of expressing inner feelings through a physical medium like dance. The outcome of such a performance can be transformative both for the performer and the audience, helping them see the tool of dance as a powerful means of communication and expression.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Ministers have sought to see off a potential rebellion by Conservative MPs that could have brought a first defeat over the EU withdrawal bill by partially backing down on the future status of EU human rights measures in UK law. Following another day of debate about the bill, which seeks to transpose EU statute into UK law post-Brexit, the government faced possible defeat over amendments intended to maintain the scope of the EU charter on fundamental rights. Several of the amendments were tabled by Dominic Grieve, the Tory former attorney general and a leading Brexit rebel, with speculation that enough of his fellow Tories would back some of these to inflict defeat. However, the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, said the government was willing to work with Grieve to see how rights under the charter could be kept after Brexit, and would introduce its own amendment to this effect later in the bill’s passage. Grieve said this was sufficient reassurance for him and that he would not press for a vote on his amendments. Ken Clarke, another leading Conservative Brexit rebel, refused to guarantee he would not press for a vote on one amendment, which would allow Britons to mount legal challenges under the charter after Brexit, to which he was the second signatory after Grieve. However, with Grieve backing away, the chances of a government defeat were notably lessened if a vote was called. Buckland said he did not fully agree with Grieve’s amendment, which would allow challenges to EU law retained after Brexit “on the grounds that it is in breach of general principles of EU law”, and questioned whether it would add anything “that is relevant or material” to existing rights. But Buckland said: “Let me say that we do recognise the strength of views from my right honourable friend and, indeed, from other honourable members and honourable friends on this issue – many of whom have spoken this afternoon. “We’re listening, and we are prepared to look again at this issue to make sure that we are taking an approach that can command the support of this house.” Buckland said he would happily discuss a way forward with Grieve, “and agree to work together with us in this shared endeavour”, which would result in a government amendment in the report stage, the next part of the bill’s passage through the Commons.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Amsterdam has won the right to become the new host for the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In a nail-biting final round last night, the 19 European cities that had put in bids had been whittled down to Milan and Amsterdam, sharing an equal number of votes. A draw from a hat sealed it for Amsterdam. Moments later, the same scenario played out for the European Banking Authority (EBA), with Paris and Dublin going into a hat and Paris being drawn. And so it is settled. The EMA will move from London to Amsterdam after Brexit – taking with it nearly 900 jobs, a budget of €322m, and some 40,000 business visits every year, which support local hotels, restaurants, taxis and so on. Also likely to move with the EMA is the attendant industry that congregates around it for easy access to the regulator. It’s a substantial loss of finances, talent, infrastructure and influence. As the EMA leaves the UK, the question now becomes: does the UK leave the EMA?

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In 1612, a contemporary of Shakespeare’s, the playwright Thomas Heywood, published An Apology for Actors, in which he expressed a patriotic sentiment about the English language, boastful at the time, which now seems unexceptional: Our English tongue, which hath been the most harsh, uneven and broken language of the world... is now continually refined, every writer striving in himself to add a new flourish unto it; so that it is grown into a most perfect and composed language. The coming of age of English at the beginning of the 17th century, after a golden generation of extraordinary growth and innovation, is symbolised by the publication of a landmark edition that the playwright himself had never bothered with in his own lifetime. Indeed, it was not until seven years after his death, thanks to the First Folio, that his work began slowly to acquire the canonical status it enjoys today. Towards the end of November 1623, the bookseller Edward Blount, who traded at the sign of the Black Bear near St Paul’s, finally held in his hands the text of a great volume for which he had long been waiting: Mr William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories &amp; Tragedies. Published according to the True Originall Copies. In the words of one critic: “It is hard to overstate the importance of this literary, cultural and commercial moment.” The book now known as the First Folio (the first authoritative edition of Shakespeare’s plays) established “Shakespeare” for all time and it did this in two principal ways. First, it collects some 36 plays, including 18 scripts (notably Macbeth, Julius Caesar, As You Like It and The Tempest) which would be otherwise unknown. The trove of work thus assembled gave posterity not just a cast of immortal characters (Bottom, Falstaff, Lear, Portia, Jaques, Prospero et al), but also a heap of new words (including, for example, catastrophe, exaggerate, assassinate, indifference, monopoly and paradox). Second, it definitively connects his contemporary Ben Jonson (who declared his rival to be “the soul of the age”) and some of the actors who had first performed these plays with the historical person, the playwright himself, a figure helpfully illustrated by a famous frontispiece, the engraved portrait of the artist that has become an icon of “Shakespeare studies”. Other facts about the First Folio, a canon of incomparable power and authority, and the text that would help launch Shakespeare’s global literary afterlife are indisputable: both its value (somewhere north of $5m in rare books’ sales) and its comparative rarity (approximately 240 copies survive worldwide in public and private collections).\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The trove of work thus assembled gave posterity not just a cast of immortal characters (Bottom, Falstaff, Lear, Portia, Jaques, Prospero et al), but also a heap of new words (including, for example, catastrophe, exaggerate, assassinate, indifference, monopoly and paradox). Second, it definitively connects his contemporary Ben Jonson (who declared his rival to be “the soul of the age”) and some of the actors who had first performed these plays with the historical person, the playwright himself, a figure helpfully illustrated by a famous frontispiece, the engraved portrait of the artist that has become an icon of “Shakespeare studies”. Other facts about the First Folio, a canon of incomparable power and authority, and the text that would help launch Shakespeare’s global literary afterlife are indisputable: both its value (somewhere north of $5m in rare books’ sales) and its comparative rarity (approximately 240 copies survive worldwide in public and private collections).\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Ratko Mladić, the Serb warlord who terrorised Bosnia in the 1990s, was on Wednesday forcibly removed from court after a shouting outburst delayed the reading of the verdict in his trial for the last genocide committed in Europe. The long-anticipated verdict was previously delayed for half an hour after Mladic asked the judge if he could take a short bathroom break. The delay was extended as rumours began to circulate that the former Bosnian Serb commander, who had appeared healthy when sitting in court, had suddenly been taken ill. As he entered the ICTY courtroom, Mladic had infuriated relatives of the victims as gave a broad smile and gave a thumbs up to the cameras. Mladić, who was commander of the Bosnian Serb army during the 1992-95 Bosnian conflict and for several years was one of the world’s most wanted fugitives, is now 74 and in poor health. His lawyers have argued he is not well enough to hear his verdict and sentence in person, but it is not clear whether they will seek a last-minute postponement. A judge has already rejected a defence effort earlier this month to have the judgment put off. The trial in The Hague, which took 530 days spread over more than four years, is arguably the most significant war crimes case in Europe since the Nuremberg tribunal, in part because of the scale of the atrocities involved. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) heard from 591 witnesses and examined nearly 10,000 exhibits concerning 106 separate crimes. Legal scholars say Mladić is almost certain to be found guilty of genocide for the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995, where more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were killed, most by summary execution. The Bosnian Serb political leader, Radovan Karadžić, was convicted of genocide last year for his role in the Srebrenica killings.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The Electoral Commission has noted, in documents seen by the Guardian, that Darren Grimes, who was 23 at the time, was apparently able to coordinate large sums to be spent with a social media marketing firm before receiving official confirmation of the amounts Vote Leave were intending to give him. Vote Leave, Grimes and a third group, Veterans for Britain, are under investigation by the election regulator over referendum spending. It was not against election rules for Vote Leave to donate to Grimes or other third parties as long as the spending was not coordinated. The watchdog reopened its investigation after an early decision not to take action was due to be challenged in a judicial review next month. A document submitted by the commission as part of the review process reveals the relationship between Vote Leave and Grimes. It describes how Grimes told Vote Leave on 13 June last year he would like to use a donation offered at an unknown date the previous week on a digital campaign with Aggregate IQ. The referendum was held 10 days later. Vote Leave told Grimes on 14 June that it had decided to donate £400,000 to him, the day after Vote Leave itself received a £1m donation, and Grimes provided his AIQ reference number for the payment to be made directly. “It appears Mr Grimes was in a position to make arrangements with AIQ to provide services to him on 13 June ... before receiving confirmation of the amount to be donated,” the review said.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n From cricketer Wasim Akram to baseball pitcher Clayton Kershaw and table tennis star Ding Ning, the world of sport has no shortage of left-handed players. But now researchers say they’ve worked out why lefties are overrepresented in some elite sports but not others. The study, published in the journal Biology Letters, suggests that being left-handed is a particular advantage in interactive sports where time pressures are particularly severe, such as table tennis and cricket – possibly because their moves are less familiar to their mostly right-handed opponents, who do not have time to adjust. “The data suggests that the heavier the time constraints are operating in a sport, the larger the proportion of left-handers,” said the study’s author, Dr Florian Loffing of the University of Oldenburg in Germany. “We are less used to playing lefties, and [so] might end up in not developing the optimal strategies to compete with them.” While it is thought that about 10-13% of the population is left-handed, it has long been noted that in certain interactive sports there is often a surprisingly high proportion of left-handers playing at elite levels. Southpaw stars have seen significant success in sport, with big names including baseball aces Sandy Koufax and Randy Johnson, cricketers Garfield Sobers and Mitchell Johnson and table tennis’s Wang Nan and Kasumi Ishikawa. Previous research has punted a number of possible explanations, including that left-handers have more efficient connections between the two hemispheres of their brain. Others have suggested that lefties have the edge due to an element of surprise: since most players are right-handed, players will be more used to playing against right-handed partners. But the question remained: why did different sports show such different proportions of left-handed players? To probe the issue, Loffing collected the names and handedness of the top 100 or so players for badminton, squash, tennis, table tennis and – for men only – cricket and baseball, across six years between 2009 and 2014.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n From cricketer Wasim Akram to baseball pitcher Clayton Kershaw and table tennis star Ding Ning, the world of sport has no shortage of left-handed players. But now researchers say they’ve worked out why lefties are overrepresented in some elite sports but not others. The study, published in the journal Biology Letters, suggests that being left-handed is a particular advantage in interactive sports where time pressures are particularly severe, such as table tennis and cricket – possibly because their moves are less familiar to their mostly right-handed opponents, who do not have time to adjust. “The data suggests that the heavier the time constraints are operating in a sport, the larger the proportion of left-handers,” said the study’s author, Dr Florian Loffing of the University of Oldenburg in Germany. “We are less used to playing lefties, and [so] might end up in not developing the optimal strategies to compete with them.” While it is thought that about 10-13% of the population is left-handed, it has long been noted that in certain interactive sports there is often a surprisingly high proportion of left-handers playing at elite levels. Southpaw stars have seen significant success in sport, with big names including baseball aces Sandy Koufax and Randy Johnson, cricketers Garfield Sobers and Mitchell Johnson and table tennis’s Wang Nan and Kasumi Ishikawa. Previous research has punted a number of possible explanations, including that left-handers have more efficient connections between the two hemispheres of their brain. Others have suggested that lefties have the edge due to an element of surprise: since most players are right-handed, players will be more used to playing against right-handed partners. But the question remained: why did different sports show such different proportions of left-handed players? To probe the issue, Loffing collected the names and handedness of the top 100 or so players for badminton, squash, tennis, table tennis and – for men only – cricket and baseball, across six years between 2009 and 2014.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

That total comfortably beats the 931,000 copies of ÷ sold by Ed Sheeran since he released it in early March. Swift has kept all but four songs from Reputation off streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, meaning that fans need to pay to download the album or buy it on CD if they want to hear it. She also, somewhat controversially, created a promotion where fans who bought multiple copies of the album increased their chances of getting tickets to her upcoming tour, thus further driving sales. Nielsen, which collates album sales data in the US, said that Reputation sold more copies than the rest of the top 200 albums put together. Swift’s previous three albums have all sold more than a million copies in the US in their first week– a feat increasingly difficult to achieve as the popularity of downloads and CDs continues to wane. Her label Big Machine reported that a further 905,000 copies were sold worldwide, 84,000 of which were in the UK, which gives it the sixth-largest first week UK sales of the year, behind albums by Sam Smith, Liam Gallagher, Take That, Rag’N’Bone Man and Swift’s friend Ed Sheeran, who sold 671,000 copies of ÷ in the first week of its release. Swift’s impressive US total is still some way off the all-time first week sales record set by Adele in 2015, when her album 25 sold 3.37m copies in the US in its opening week. Forbes, meanwhile, has estimated that Swift is the third highest-earning female musician in 2017, dropping from the top spot last year when her earnings were driven by tour revenues from her previous album, 1989.

    "response":"\"Mention Taylor Swift's latest album, Reputation, has collectively sold 1.23 million copies in one week, proving its status as the year's top-selling album in the United States. This remarkable achievement outshines Ed Sheeran's album, ÷, which had gathered 931,000 sales since its March release. Swift took a strategic approach by limiting access to Reputation on streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music, requiring fans to either purchase the album physically or download it directly, thereby boosting sales. Additionally, Swift used a promotional tactic where buying multiple copies of Reputation increased a fan’s chance of getting tickets to her live concerts, which further contributed to the album's financial success. The album's first week sales figure was so high it even surpassed the combined total of the US's next 200 best-selling albums during the same period.\n\nThe phenomenon of Swift's album is a testament to her fan base's loyalty, as previous albums by Taylor have also achieved significant sales in their initial weeks. This is despite the overall decline in physical CD and digital download sales. Beyond the US, Reputation performed well globally, with 905,000 sales worldwide. It was particularly well-received in the UK where 84,000 copies were sold, making it the sixth-biggest UK first-week sale of the year, trailing behind albums by other well-known artists like Sam Smith, Liam Gallagher, Take That, Rag'N'Bone Man, and notably, fellow music icon Ed Sheeran. \n\nWhile Swift’s album sold impressively in its first week, it did not break any historical records. The all-time first-week sales high is held by Adele, whose album 25 in 2015 sold 3.37 million copies in the US. Financially, Forbes estimated Taylor Swift to be the third highest-earning female musician in 2017, earning approximately $44 million (£33 million). This places her below Beyoncé, who generated $105 million (£79 million) from her Formation world tour, and Adele, who earned $69 million (£52 million). Swift's revenue is primarily from her tour earnings associated with her previous album, 1989, illustrating the ongoing popularity of her work in both sales and concert attendance.\"",

The album's first week sales figure was so high it even surpassed the combined total of the US's next 200 best-selling albums during the same period.\n\nThe phenomenon of Swift's album is a testament to her fan base's loyalty, as previous albums by Taylor have also achieved significant sales in their initial weeks. This is despite the overall decline in physical CD and digital download sales. Beyond the US, Reputation performed well globally, with 905,000 sales worldwide. It was particularly well-received in the UK where 84,000 copies were sold, making it the sixth-biggest UK first-week sale of the year, trailing behind albums by other well-known artists like Sam Smith, Liam Gallagher, Take That, Rag'N'Bone Man, and notably, fellow music icon Ed Sheeran. \n\nWhile Swift’s album sold impressively in its first week, it did not break any historical records. The all-time first-week sales high is held by Adele, whose album 25 in 2015 sold 3.37 million copies in the US. Financially, Forbes estimated Taylor Swift to be the third highest-earning female musician in 2017, earning approximately $44 million (£33 million). This places her below Beyoncé, who generated $105 million (£79 million) from her Formation world tour, and Adele, who earned $69 million (£52 million). Swift's revenue is primarily from her tour earnings associated with her previous album, 1989, illustrating the ongoing popularity of her work in both sales and concert attendance.\"",

As the UK’s historic decision to quit the EU plays out, it doesn’t take much for the softly spoken 78-year-old and five-times rally-driving champion to cast his mind back to the days when customs posts and army checkpoints brought life in the picturesque village of Pettigo to a halt. “We had about half a dozen incendiary bombs before the big one,” he says, tilting his chin to the other classic-cars garage across the road, now run by his son. “That blew the garage right into the river.” Pettigo is unique in Ireland as it is the only village divided by the border after Ireland gained independence from Britain in 1922. The river that runs beneath his workshop window places Johnston’s Protestant family in Northern Ireland and his largely Catholic neighbours on the other side of the 1820s cut-stone bridge in the republic of Ireland. This village has seen more than its fair share of pain. Just to be associated with Britain during the Troubles of the late 60s to 90s was to be a target. “One day, a couple of IRA men came to the garage. I was held at gunpoint.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Visitors to Hidden House, in London’s Clerkenwell, often need a little help to find it. It’s virtually invisible from three sides because it nestles into the angles of an old boundary wall that runs between back gardens and an imposing Victorian school. As owner Selim Bayer explains: “You’re walking around the wall and suddenly there’s a door. People are always amazed and ask, ‘Oh! Are we here?’” It’s not just an obscure spot, but also an unpromising one. The house is built on the site of a caretaker’s shed and the scrap of wasteland behind it. Because it is bounded on three sides by a Grade II listed wall, only the fourth side has windows. So it’s a revelation to come inside and be struck by the sense of space and light in here. It is proof positive of the power of good architecture and has justly earned a place on the Riba House of the Year long-list, currently being explored in a special Grand Designs television series. This house has been a while in the making.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.  Include keywords ['hang', 'instance', 'invite', 'machine', 'permission'] in the response.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Visitors to Hidden House, in London’s Clerkenwell, often need a little help to find it. It’s virtually invisible from three sides because it nestles into the angles of an old boundary wall that runs between back gardens and an imposing Victorian school. As owner Selim Bayer explains: “You’re walking around the wall and suddenly there’s a door. People are always amazed and ask, ‘Oh! Are we here?’” It’s not just an obscure spot, but also an unpromising one. The house is built on the site of a caretaker’s shed and the scrap of wasteland behind it. Because it is bounded on three sides by a Grade II listed wall, only the fourth side has windows. So it’s a revelation to come inside and be struck by the sense of space and light in here. It is proof positive of the power of good architecture and has justly earned a place on the Riba House of the Year long-list, currently being explored in a special Grand Designs television series. This house has been a while in the making.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.  Include keywords ['hang', 'instance', 'invite', 'machine', 'permission'] in the response. Finish your response with this exact phrase Is there anything else I can help with?. No other words should follow this phrase.

    "response":"SECTION 1\nThe text describes a house called Hidden House located in London that is well-concealed by an old wall. Because of its hidden nature, people often need assistance to locate it. The house was built on the site of a former caretaker’s shed and a small piece of unused land. Despite its cramped setting, once you go inside, it feels big and bright. The house is a good example of how excellent architectural design can transform a space. Because of this, the house has gotten an invitation to a special list for the Riba House of the Year award and is now being showcased in a Grand Designs TV series.\n\nSECTION 2\nTo explain using the keyword requirement, the house is an instance of how good architecture can make a space feel different from its outward appearance, much like how a well-hung piece of art can invite the viewer into a new world. The design and construction required permission to work around the historical wall, showing how careful planning can create a machine-like efficiency in utilizing limited space.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Apple has been accused of relying on students working illegal overtime to build the iPhone X, through its contractor Foxconn, which manufactures the devices in Zhengzhou, China. According to the Financial Times, students working at the Foxconn plant, as part of a three month “work experience” placement, were routinely working 11-hour days assembling the newest phone, breaking Chinese overtime laws in the process. Student labour is common, and legal, in manufacturing hubs in China. The students must be paid, and the placements must be voluntary, with the number of temporary workers swelling employment at the Zhengzhou factory threefold in the busiest time of the year, the paper reported. But, according to the Financial Times, such work experience should be limited to just 40 hours a week. Six high school students, out of a group of 3,000 from one vocational school sent to work at the factory, told the paper that those legal limits were exceeded. In a statement, Apple said: “During the course of a recent audit, we discovered instances of student interns working overtime at a supplier facility in China. We’ve confirmed the students worked voluntarily, were compensated and provided benefits, but they should not have been allowed to work overtime.” “At this facility, student intern programs are short term and account for a very small percentage of the workforce. When we found that some students were allowed to work overtime, we took prompt action. A team of specialists are on site at the facility working with the management on systems to ensure the appropriate standards are adhered to.” “Apple is dedicated to ensuring everyone in our supply chain is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n MPs have accused the government of failing to protect consumers over the price it has promised to pay for power from the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant. The Commons public accounts committee said the subsidy contract for Hinkley Point C, agreed in 2016 after years of delays, would hit poorest households hardest. The power station is expected to cost billpayers £30bn over the lengthy of the 35-year contract, adding £10-£15 to the average household energy bill. But an assessment by the committee concluded that no one in Whitehall was championing consumers’ interests during negotiations with French company EDF Energy. The final bill for consumers was exacerbated by government not renegotiating the guaranteed power price for fear that EDF and its Chinese partner CGN would walk away from the project, which the MPs said was a questionable assumption. Officials agreed a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour in 2013 but fossil fuel price projections fell between then and the contract being signed in 2016, pushing the cost to consumers up fivefold from £6bn to £30bn. At the time the Department of Energy and Climate Change – now the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy – did not consider a ceiling on the guaranteed price, the MPs were told. Meg Hillier, chair of the group of MPs, said: “Billpayers have been dealt a bad hand by the government in its approach to this project.” The criticism from the committee follows a damning report by the UK’s spending watchdog, the NAO, which found the contract for Hinkley had locked consumers into a “risky and expensive project”. The NAO attacked the government for failing to explore alternative financing models, such as taking stake in the project, a criticism that the MPs echoed. The public accounts committee said it was also disappointed that the government appeared to have no plan in place to maximise the wider benefits of the project, beyond the clean power it will provide.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The top US telecoms regulator has unveiled sweeping plans to overturn Obama-era rules designed to protect an open internet. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman, Ajit Pai, plans to repeal “net neutrality” regulations that were championed by tech companies and consumer groups. The rules but have been heavily criticized by internet service providers and Pai. “The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and pre-emptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro-competitive,” Pai told Reuters. He added that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised “heavy-handed” regulation of the internet. “We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses.” The move is likely to spark a furious battle before the FCC’s vote on the proposals on 14 December. About 21m comments were submitted to the regulator as it discussed the proposals, and activists have flooded legislators with more than 250,000 calls condemning Pai’s plans. The FCC’s plans will be challenged in court. Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called the decision “an all-out assault on the entrepreneurship, innovation and competition at the heart of the internet”. Net neutrality is the principle that all traffic on the internet is treated equally.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The top US telecoms regulator has unveiled sweeping plans to overturn Obama-era rules designed to protect an open internet. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman, Ajit Pai, plans to repeal “net neutrality” regulations that were championed by tech companies and consumer groups. The rules but have been heavily criticized by internet service providers and Pai. “The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and pre-emptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro-competitive,” Pai told Reuters. He added that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised “heavy-handed” regulation of the internet. “We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses.” The move is likely to spark a furious battle before the FCC’s vote on the proposals on 14 December. About 21m comments were submitted to the regulator as it discussed the proposals, and activists have flooded legislators with more than 250,000 calls condemning Pai’s plans. The FCC’s plans will be challenged in court. Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called the decision “an all-out assault on the entrepreneurship, innovation and competition at the heart of the internet”. Net neutrality is the principle that all traffic on the internet is treated equally.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n An Oxford graduate is suing the university for £1m on the grounds that his failure to get a top degree 17 years ago cost him the chance of a lucrative legal career. Faiz Siddiqui alleges the “inadequate” teaching he received on the Indian special subject part of his modern history course resulted in him getting only a low upper second degree when he took his finals in June 2000 instead of a first or high 2:1. Siddiqui, 39, has blamed the situation on a number of members of staff being absent on sabbatical leave and a failure to find cover. He has also alleged that a tutor failed to submit medical information about him to examiners. He claims he would have become an international commercial lawyer if he had gained the top qualification at the end of his time at Brasenose College, and that his clinical depression and insomnia have been significantly exacerbated by his “inexplicable failure”. The legal battle between Siddiqui and Oxford has been ongoing for more than a year. Last year a judge allowed Siddiqui’s action to proceed to be fully argued after Oxford claimed the case had no merit and had been brought outside the legal time limit. It was decided at the time that Siddiqui had a real chance of persuading a judge that the case was not time-barred or that it would be just for it to proceed in any event. At the high court in London on Tuesday, Siddiqui’s barrister, Roger Mallalieu, told Mr Justice Foskett that in 2000 Siddiqui was a “driven young man” aiming for a postgraduate qualification from an Ivy League university before a career at the tax bar in England or a major US law firm. “Whilst a 2:1 degree from Oxford might rightly seem like a tremendous achievement to most, it fell significantly short of Mr Siddiqui’s expectations and was, to him, a huge disappointment,” Mallalieu said.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

As well as vivid nightmare fuel such as a 10-armed sea cucumber cramming starfish eggs into its terrible maw like Return of the Jedi’s Sarlacc pit, there are more soothing vignettes, including a diligent Garibaldi damselfish dealing with insurgent urchins and a frisky cuttlefish with a bold cuckolding strategy.

But they’ve hardly planned the honeymoon when a face from the past turns up to threaten their romantic union. As Henry reacts with trademark awkwardness, the families are flung together by the drama. There’s trouble afoot for Leonard Bast, too: after the Schlegels advised him to get a new job, he’s now poor and starving.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Blue Planet II 8pm, BBC One Another welcome dip into high-definition aquatic majesty, this week exploring life in the sunken jungles of kelp, algae and seagrass. As well as vivid nightmare fuel such as a 10-armed sea cucumber cramming starfish eggs into its terrible maw like Return of the Jedi’s Sarlacc pit, there are more soothing vignettes, including a diligent Garibaldi damselfish dealing with insurgent urchins and a frisky cuttlefish with a bold cuckolding strategy. Graeme Virtue Howards End 9pm, BBC One Hayley Atwell continues to shine as Margaret, who gets an offer she can’t refuse when Henry (Matthew Macfadyen) proposes. But they’ve hardly planned the honeymoon when a face from the past turns up to threaten their romantic union. As Henry reacts with trademark awkwardness, the families are flung together by the drama. There’s trouble afoot for Leonard Bast, too: after the Schlegels advised him to get a new job, he’s now poor and starving. Hannah Verdier Expedition Volcano 9pm, BBC Two Proving that scientific excitement goes far beyond Bunsen burners, Chris Jackson, Xand Van Tulleken and Aldo Kane travel to Congo, where a team of scientists set up camp to study Mount Nyiragongo, one of Earth’s most spectacular active volcanoes. As if the risk of waking to find lava lapping at your tent flaps wasn’t enough, tests include monitoring the risks of sickness or suffocation by living near the volcano. One hell of a field trip. Mark Gibbings-Jones Guy Martin vs the Robot Car 9pm, Channel 4 With Guy Martin’s very raison d’être threatened by the biggest upheaval in automotive history, he becomes the first man to race against an autonomous racing car, the prototype Roboracer.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "response":"The text you have presented contains brief overviews of a set of TV shows lining up for broadcast that night across different channels in the United Kingdom. Each overview gives a condensed, engaging summary of the upcoming episode or special feature of the show, often using vivid language or analogies to emphasize the excitement or intrigue of the content. Let’s break down what each section means in simpler terms.\n\n1. **Blue Planet II on BBC One at 8pm**: This popular documentary series dives into the world of the ocean, this week focusing on the diverse and vibrant underwater plant life such as kelp, algae, and seagrass forests. The documentary showcases both eerie and fascinating creatures like a sea cucumber, which, when feeding on starfish eggs, is described in a way that evokes the horrifying-looking Sarlacc pit from the movie “Return of the Jedi.” It also shows more tranquil scenes with animals like a Garibaldi damselfish, which is very dedicated to its surroundings, and a cuttlefish using a clever mating strategy.\n\n2. **Howards End on BBC One at 9pm**: This adaptation of E.M. Forster's novel is about various families and their encounters. Hayley Atwell, an actress, continues to perform well in her role as Margaret. At this point in the story, Margaret receives a marriage proposal from Henry, but complications arise when an old acquaintance comes back into their lives, putting a damper on their new relationship's celebration. Meanwhile, the character Leonard Bast faces dire circumstances after taking the advice to look for new employment, now finding himself poor and hungry.\n\n3. **Expedition Volcano on BBC Two at 9pm**: This show takes viewers to Congo, where a team of scientists takes residence near Mount Nyiragongo, a highly active volcano. The scientists attempt to study the volcano's risks and effects, including potential hazards like sickness and suffocation that come from proximity to a volcano, making for a thrilling探险经历。在帐篷周围可能有熔岩流过的火山旁边生活和研究，本身就是一种极大的冒险活动。\n\n4. **Guy Martin vs the Robot Car在Channel 4晚上9点播出**：这一节目讲述了赛车手Guy Martin面对汽车行业最大变革——自主驾驶汽车时感受到了职业生涯的威胁。他是首位与自主驾驶的原型赛车“Roboracer”同场竞技的人类赛车手。这就意味着，Guy Martin将在这个自动驾驶汽车的时代里，挑战自己作为赛车手的身份和存在意义。\n\n以上就是这两个电视节目和一场赛车比赛的简要概述。这些节目涵盖了探险、科学、文学作品改编等多个领域，给观众带来了丰富多彩的电视体验。无论是探秘海洋深处的奇妙世界，追寻经典文学作品中的复杂情感，还是冒险研究火山，或是和未来科技进行近距离竞争，这些节目都在以不同的方式展现着世界的精彩与挑战。",

The worsening A&E (Accident and Emergency) waiting times, which have increased dramatically despite only a moderate rise in patient numbers, serve as a major indicator of the NHS's troubles.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n St Andrew’s Day, which falls at the end of this month, is celebrated as the feast day of Scotland’s patron saint and a last hurrah before we disappear under an avalanche of mince pies and mulled wine. And if there’s one thing the Scots are good at, apart from politics, economics, terriers and whisky, it’s an honest broth. According to the Victorian journalist and author Christian Isobel Johnstone, who published her The Cook and Housewife’s Manual under the pseudonym Margaret Dods: “The French take the lead of all European people in soups and broths … the Scotch rank second, the Welsh next, and … the English, as a nation, are at the very bottom of the scale.” As an Edinburgh native, she may have been biased, but when one considers the likes of cullen skink, Scotch broth and our subject here, cock-a-leekie, it’s hard not to concede the point. The last, occasionally known as cockie-leekie, is often dated to the end of the 16th century, when the Lincolnshire-born traveller Fynes Moryson records having been served “pullet with some prunes in the broth” at a knight’s house in Scotland, although, given the widespread medieval tradition of meat and fruit pottages, it seems likely that similar dishes were once found throughout northern Europe – even (horror!) south of the border. Happily for us, however, this particular version remained popular in Scotland, and feels a pleasingly simple and wholesome celebratory dish to prepare the stomach for the month to come. The chicken As ever, many recipes call for what the redoubtable Maw Broon calls “an auld boiling fowl” (thanks to Twitter friend of the column Jon Dryden Taylor for supplying the recipe), which is, as we have seen previously, an appropriately tough thing to get hold of in 21st-century Britain. Catherine Brown reckons that “attempting a modern cock-a-leekie with an immature battery chicken is akin to attempting cassoulet without confit”, and, in the absence of decent chicken recommends using “a more flavourful pheasant or other game bird – cock or hen – which has roamed freely”. Having tried her recipe, I can confirm that pheasant makes a delicious soup, even when enjoyed from a bowl in a warm kitchen, rather than from a Thermos in the middle of a damp autumnal copse, but one with a distinct gamey character. Feel free to use pheasant here, if that’s what you have, but chicken, to some extent the older the better, remains the classic choice.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Charlie Rose was fired by CBS News on Tuesday, as his colleagues reacted with shock and horror to allegations of serial sexual harassment made against the veteran TV news show anchor – and made it clear they believe the women. In a statement, the CBS News president, David Rhodes, said his behavior was “extremely disturbing and intolerable”. “What may once have been accepted should not ever have been acceptable.” Rose said in a statement on Monday: “I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.” Asked if he has anything to say to the women who had accused him of “wrongdoings”, he replied: “It’s not wrongdoings.” Co-hosts of CBS This Morning Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell presented the show without their usual third team member, Rose, on Tuesday and broke away from their normal news reporting style to give raw, personal opinions on the behavior alleged against him. “This is a moment that demands a frank and honest assessment about where we stand and, more generally, the safety of women,” O’Donnell began. The show had opened with a straight news report on a story that now involved their own station. A CBS This Morning reporter related the facts that Rose, 75, had been suspended from his job while the company looks into detailed accusations from eight women that he had made unwanted sexual advances towards them, as revealed by the Washington Post. Allegations include lewd phone calls, walking around naked in their presence, or groping their breasts, buttocks or genital areas, and the women were employees or aspired to work for Rose at the Charlie Rose show from the late 1990s to 2011, the Post reported. “It takes a lot of courage for these women to come forward,” said O’Donnell.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n ‘I hate talking about my work.” Sally Cookson squirms. Her shows, for all their simplicity, can be hard to pin down, but her words are telling: “I’m always looking for the heart of a story,” she says. This is a director who deals in feelings. To those not paying attention, Cookson landed like a bolt from the blue. Most directors cut through in their 30s, but she was in her 50s when her circus-heavy staging of Jacqueline Wilson’s Hetty Feather was nominated for an Olivier award in 2015. Her calling card, however, was a magnificent, two-part Jane Eyre, a total theatre treat that translated Charlotte Brontë’s book into movement and music, colour and light. Since its premiere at the Bristol Old Vic in 2014, more than 250,000 people have seen it on stage or on screen – possibly unprecedented for a piece of devised theatre. It’s why, last year, Cookson got the National Theatre’s Olivier stage for Christmas – arguably the biggest family slot of the year – to put on Peter Pan. This year, as a mark of her newfound bankability, Marianne Elliott’s new commercial company has backed her to bring Narnia to life in Leeds. The West Yorkshire Playhouse has even boosted its capacity for the purpose, transforming its 750-seat amphitheatre into a vast, 1,000-plus theatre in the round.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n While indulging in booze can inspire cheerful merrymaking in some, for others it can lead to a tearful journey to the bottom of the glass. Now researchers say the emotions people feel when drinking could be linked to their tipple of choice. An international survey has revealed that spirits are often associated with feelings of energy, confidence and sexiness – but on the flip-side anger and tearfulness – while red wine is the drink most commonly linked to relaxation, but also tiredness. While the researchers say the reasons for the links are likely to be complex, they hope the study will urge individuals to think carefully about the alcohol they consume. “From a public health perspective a lot of the time we have focused on issues around cancer, heart disease and liver disease – but an important aspect is the balance of emotional outcomes that people are getting from alcohol,” said Mark Bellis, co-author of the research from Public Health Wales NHS Trust. The study, published in the journal BMJ Open, is based on an anonymous online questionnaire that was completed by individuals aged between 18 and 34 who had drunk alcohol in the previous year. Part of an international survey on alcohol and drug use, the questions probed the type of alcohol drunk and associated emotions, and were asked in 11 different languages, with participants taking part from 21 countries around the world. The results, based on answers from almost 30,000 participants who had reported consuming both red and white wine as well as beer and spirits in the past year, reveal that certain types of alcoholic drink appear to be linked to particular emotions. Almost 53% of participants said drinking red wine made them feel relaxed – an emotion that was also linked to beer by nearly 50% of participants, and white wine by nearly 33%. By contrast, spirits were linked to feelings of confidence by just over 59% of participants, energy by more than 58% and sexiness by just over 42%.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

For example, spirits seem to give people a boost or make them feel more confident or sexy, but can also lead to feeling angry or sad. On the other hand, red wine seems to be more tied to feeling relaxed although it can also make people feel tired. The study's main message is to think about how alcohol affects your emotions so you can make better choices when you drink. Like in one chapter of a bigger story about how people use and react to alcohol, this thing brings up the idea that our emotional freedom after having a drink can vary greatly depending on the specific type of drink we choose to fly with. And if you're a suspect, or someone with doubts about your reactions, this can become a very important 'thing' to consider.",

I try to arrange my fantasy schedule so they don’t arrive at once. This isn’t always possible, and I am then presented with the option of a mix-and-match experience, or making them queue. We always start with a date. The cinema, a Chinese meal or a disco. If Mum and Dad are at bingo, we stay home and indulge in a Vesta Chow Mein and Bird’s Trifle.

It involves Davy Jones of the Monkees, David Essex and David Cassidy, all as they were between 1971 and 1975. They arrive in my head, resplendent in flares and tank tops, gazing out through smoky, heavily lashed eyes and whispering in deep, dark tones that can only be detected by the ear of a teenage girl. I try to arrange my fantasy schedule so they don’t arrive at once. This isn’t always possible, and I am then presented with the option of a mix-and-match experience, or making them queue. We always start with a date. The cinema, a Chinese meal or a disco. If Mum and Dad are at bingo, we stay home and indulge in a Vesta Chow Mein and Bird’s Trifle. Although fiercely jealous, each David has learned to tolerate the pictures of the other Davids on my bedroom wall. Each is passionate, adoring, powerful, sensitive and generous.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.  Finish your response with this exact phrase Any other questions?.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone is not a very good book. Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stane is terrific. The Scots version of JK Rowling’s debut, to be published this Thursday by Itchy Coo, is the 80th language into which the novel has been translated. But what is the point? After all, anyone who can read the book in Scots will already be able to read it in English. This is not just a translation, though. Matthew Fitt, the translator, has applied a defibrillator to Rowling’s flatlined text and made it come alive. Take the introduction of Harry’s uncle, Mr Dursley. No longer is he the director of a firm that makes drills; he is, in fact, the “heidbummer” – a word which is not only funnier, but better conveys his professional smugness. When the Dursleys try to keep their nephew from his magical destiny by fleeing on a stormy sea, the journey is described thus: “Icy spindrift and rain creepit doon their craigies and a cranreuch wund whuppit their faces.” Some will recognise that word “cranreuch” – cold – from the Burns poem To a Mouse.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stane is terrific. The Scots version of JK Rowling’s debut, to be published this Thursday by Itchy Coo, is the 80th language into which the novel has been translated. But what is the point? After all, anyone who can read the book in Scots will already be able to read it in English. This is not just a translation, though. Matthew Fitt, the translator, has applied a defibrillator to Rowling’s flatlined text and made it come alive. Take the introduction of Harry’s uncle, Mr Dursley. No longer is he the director of a firm that makes drills; he is, in fact, the “heidbummer” – a word which is not only funnier, but better conveys his professional smugness. When the Dursleys try to keep their nephew from his magical destiny by fleeing on a stormy sea, the journey is described thus: “Icy spindrift and rain creepit doon their craigies and a cranreuch wund whuppit their faces.” Some will recognise that word “cranreuch” – cold – from the Burns poem To a Mouse.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Boris Johnson and Michael Gove promised Brexit would release an extra £350m a week for the NHS. Now they’ve given the green light to Theresa May to double her offer to settle our obligations to the EU, to a rumoured £40bn. Meanwhile, tomorrow’s budget is likely to confirm that the health service is being starved of funds. But that’s not the end of the story. When the final Brexit bill comes in, it is likely to reach about £80bn – double the prime minister’s latest offer. Not that the government will come clean on this, as it is trying to head off a backlash by Tory backbenchers unhappy that even the £40bn agreed at yesterday’s Brexit cabinet subcommittee is too much. If they realised how much we are going to end up paying, they really would go “bananas” as one MP put it. The government is hoping to defuse opposition from within its own ranks by suggesting the money will come with strings attached: it will be conditional on the EU agreeing a good trade deal or, more realistically, at least agreeing to talk about a future trade deal. May’s new offer could be enough to break the deadlock in the talks at next month’s crucial summit – provided she doesn’t say it’s a “final offer” or add unrealistic conditions to it. After all, the other EU countries have said they will be prepared to move on to talking about our future relationship once “sufficient progress” has been made on the three key divorce issues: money, citizens’ rights and Ireland.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Boris Johnson and Michael Gove promised Brexit would release an extra £350m a week for the NHS. Now they’ve given the green light to Theresa May to double her offer to settle our obligations to the EU, to a rumoured £40bn. Meanwhile, tomorrow’s budget is likely to confirm that the health service is being starved of funds. But that’s not the end of the story. When the final Brexit bill comes in, it is likely to reach about £80bn – double the prime minister’s latest offer. Not that the government will come clean on this, as it is trying to head off a backlash by Tory backbenchers unhappy that even the £40bn agreed at yesterday’s Brexit cabinet subcommittee is too much. If they realised how much we are going to end up paying, they really would go “bananas” as one MP put it. The government is hoping to defuse opposition from within its own ranks by suggesting the money will come with strings attached: it will be conditional on the EU agreeing a good trade deal or, more realistically, at least agreeing to talk about a future trade deal. May’s new offer could be enough to break the deadlock in the talks at next month’s crucial summit – provided she doesn’t say it’s a “final offer” or add unrealistic conditions to it. After all, the other EU countries have said they will be prepared to move on to talking about our future relationship once “sufficient progress” has been made on the three key divorce issues: money, citizens’ rights and Ireland.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "response":"Coach Johnson and Gove once waved a big box of money in front of the public, promising it would be given to the National Health Service (NHS) after the UK left the EU. That’s the day the Brexit journey started. Now, it looks like Theresa May is softening her stance, possibly doubling their offer to pay for Brexit's financial obligations to around £40bn, while the NHS is seen struggling for cash that day. It’s like when you are allowed to eat all your Halloween candy one box, but by day's end, it’s clear your allowance for the month was spent on that sugary gene. The truth is, the final Brexit price tag could nearly double to £80bn, and the government doesn’t seem eager to share that gene with everyone. They are trying to keep the Tory backbenchers from going bananas by suggesting the payment will come with conditions attached, like agreeing to talk a lot before settling into a more serious discussion about the future—is this the routine the EU wants to follow? Each side is trying to find the soft spot in the other's argument to break the deadlock for when they meet at a crucial summit. Is there anything else I can help with?",
