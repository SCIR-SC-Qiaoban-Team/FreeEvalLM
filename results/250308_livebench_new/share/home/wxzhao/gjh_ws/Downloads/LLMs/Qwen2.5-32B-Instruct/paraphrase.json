      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n It was the frog that pushed me over the edge. I’ve never been a Harry Potter fan myself – I was already out of kids’ books when they first came out, and those clever grown-up covers weren’t enough to tempt me back – but I’d always admired JK Rowling from afar. Who wouldn’t? A writer whose imagination transfixed the world, whose riches now exceed those of the Queen, but who has founded a children’s charity, pays her taxes in full, and remains both poised and politically engaged: as role models go, it is hard to think of a better one. So I was pleased when my seven-year-old son went Harry Potter crazy. Having never read to himself before, he was suddenly racing through book after book, his bedside light on late into the night. His brother and several of his friends caught the bug – just as the Suez canal flowed through Clarissa Eden’s drawing room, Hogwarts overshadowed our house, as children constantly dashed about on broomsticks, casting spells and looking for snitches. It was impressive to see the “Harry Potter effect” in action: the magical power that, in the two decades since its first publication, has revitalised the children’s publishing industry, encouraged millions of children to read, sold more than 400m copies across the world, and generated a cultural empire worth £20bn. Less pleasant, however, was the realisation that there was a marketing juggernaut poised to capitalise on my son’s enthusiasm. Unlike those first readers 20 years ago, the children discovering Harry Potter now are immediately faced with a multibillion-pound industry trading in Potter-themed “experiences” and paraphernalia.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Originally extended by modernist architect Leslie Martin in 1970, it has now received a sensitive £8.7m expansion by Jamie Fobert, including remodelled gallery spaces and an education wing, cafe and shop around a new courtyard. • Opens 10 February, Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge. Hope to Nope: Politics and Graphics 2008-2018 at the Design Museum From the endless imitations of Shepard Fairey’s seminal Hope poster for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, to the inventive plethora of Donald Trump memes, this exhibition will show how graphic design’s engagement with politics has evolved over the last decade. Featuring the work of high-profile and amateur designers, in campaign billboards, T-shirts and cartoons, it will show graphic design’s power as a tool for political discussion, debate and provocation. • Opens 28 March, Design Museum, London. Windermere Jetty Museum by Carmody Groarke A cluster of copper-clad sheds nestles on the edge of Windermere in the Lake District, signalling the new home for the Jetty Museum, a fascinating little institution that has been telling the story of boats and boatsmen since the 1940s. The new £16m complex includes a wet dock, allowing boats to be displayed on water within the museum, and a new workshop for visitors to see the conservation of steam launches, sailing yachts and motor boats in action. • Opens 2018, Windermere Jetty Museum, Bowness-on-Windermere.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theresa May has declared that tackling climate change and reducing its effects on poorer countries is a “moral imperative”, as the Conservative party renewed its push to portray itself as environmentally friendly. The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron’s 2005 efforts to show the Tories cared about global warming. Ahead of this week’s climate change summit in Paris, May said: “There is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.” She described coal as “one of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power” and hailed the “enormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents”. May’s commitment to the issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real. However, the prime minister insists “tackling climate change and mitigating its effects for the world’s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces”. At the summit she will announce a £140m boost to funding for poorer communities affected by climate change through deforestation or vulnerability to natural disasters and extreme weather, plus £15m of additional support for reconstruction on Dominica in the Caribbean, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. It comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being asked by party officials to show off their green credentials after internal polling showed the level of concern among younger voters about environmental issues. The party has been alarmed by the backlash against May’s support for a free vote on foxhunting, the omission of a ban on the ivory trade from the manifesto and its lack of support for an amendment that would have recognised in UK law that animals feel pain.

This increase in environmental funding comes as the Conservative party strives to highlight the green efforts of its MPs, following internal surveys revealing that younger voters are increasingly prioritizing environmental concerns. The party has taken notice of this trend and is revising positions on issues like fox hunting and ivory trade bans to align better with public sentiment on environmental matters.\nP.S. The Conservative Party is working to redefine its environmental stance to meet the growing concerns of its younger voter base, reflecting a strategic alignment with current global issues and public sentiments on climate change and conservation.",

Putin said a significant part of Russian forces would be withdrawn from Syria, though scepticism was warranted given that two previous announcements have been met with little noticeable scaling down. This time, however, could be different. Talk of the total defeat of Isis may be premature, but there is no doubt that Russian air power, combined with Syrian forces and Iran-backed Shia militias on the ground, has decisively shifted the balance of power in the long Syrian civil war. President Bashar al-Assad was on the brink of defeat when Russia entered the conflict in 2015. With sustained airstrikes on both moderate rebel groups and extremists, Moscow has helped Assad win back control of much of the country. The Russian and Syrian air forces were accused of brutal bombing tactics, including deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure, which the Russian military has always denied.

The prime minister made a concession on Monday by agreeing to set up a new committee of MPs to monitor any proposed legal changes as EU legislation is converted into the British statute book. She had been facing a parliamentary defeat over the issue during the debate on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday, after a widespread backbench revolt among remain- and leave-supporting MPs. However, the government has not backed down on its intention to fix the day of Brexit as 29 March 2019 or acceded to the demands of soft Brexit Tory MPs who wanted a meaningful vote on the terms of the final deal before that date. One Conservative rebel said May was in trouble over these two issues because there were enough dissatisfied Conservatives combined with Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and other opposition MPs to defeat the government. The MP said the government and the rebels were currently in a standoff with neither side prepared to back down. However, government sources were confident May had managed to convince enough of her backbenchers not to defy the whip by indicating that a vote was likely to happen well before the date of leaving and promising a second vote on legislation implementing the EU withdrawal agreement hammered out in Brussels on Friday. The appetite for rebellion among Conservative MPs will become clearer during the two days of debate and voting on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday and Wednesday. Up to 25 had threatened to revolt unless May promised more scrutiny over Brexit lawmaking, but No 10’s concessions appear to have allayed concerns among the would-be troublemakers. The government will agree to establish a new committee of MPs to help weed out the overuse of “Henry VIII powers”, which allow ministers to make changes to secondary legislation as it is transposed.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theresa May has been forced to accept more scrutiny of Brexit lawmaking to head off a Tory revolt but is still heading for a showdown over how MPs get to vote on the final deal and whether the date for leaving should be fixed in law. The prime minister made a concession on Monday by agreeing to set up a new committee of MPs to monitor any proposed legal changes as EU legislation is converted into the British statute book. She had been facing a parliamentary defeat over the issue during the debate on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday, after a widespread backbench revolt among remain- and leave-supporting MPs. However, the government has not backed down on its intention to fix the day of Brexit as 29 March 2019 or acceded to the demands of soft Brexit Tory MPs who wanted a meaningful vote on the terms of the final deal before that date. One Conservative rebel said May was in trouble over these two issues because there were enough dissatisfied Conservatives combined with Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and other opposition MPs to defeat the government. The MP said the government and the rebels were currently in a standoff with neither side prepared to back down. However, government sources were confident May had managed to convince enough of her backbenchers not to defy the whip by indicating that a vote was likely to happen well before the date of leaving and promising a second vote on legislation implementing the EU withdrawal agreement hammered out in Brussels on Friday. The appetite for rebellion among Conservative MPs will become clearer during the two days of debate and voting on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday and Wednesday. Up to 25 had threatened to revolt unless May promised more scrutiny over Brexit lawmaking, but No 10’s concessions appear to have allayed concerns among the would-be troublemakers. The government will agree to establish a new committee of MPs to help weed out the overuse of “Henry VIII powers”, which allow ministers to make changes to secondary legislation as it is transposed.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"Please paraphrase based on the sentences provided.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May has conceded to increased oversight of Brexit legislation to avoid a conservative party rebellion, but is still expected to face conflict over the specifics of how MPs will vote on the final agreement and whether the exit date will be set in law. On Monday, May agreed to form a new legislative committee of MPs tasked with supervising the transformation of EU laws into British legislation as she faces a potential parliamentary setback over the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday. This setback has been threatened due to a significant rebellion among her own backbenchers, irrespective of their stance on the EU. While the government continues to insist on setting the fixed departure date at 29 March 2019, it has not conformed to pressure from soft Brexit Tory MPs for a meaningful vote on the withdrawal deal's terms before this date. According to a dissenting Conservative MP, May is in a perilous position over these matters due to the combined tally of dissatisfied Conservatives alongside opposition from Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat, and other parties, which could lead to her government’s defeat. The situation is currently in a stand-off, yet Downing Street believes May has calmed potential rebels by hinting that a vote is likely to occur sufficiently before the planned departure date and by promising a follow-up vote on the legislation that will implement the agreement reached in Brussels. The extent of the rebellion within the Conservative ranks may become clearer as debate and voting on the EU withdrawal bill take place over Tuesday and Wednesday, with a group of 25 or more threatening to oppose the government unless more regulatory controls over the Brexit process are granted. However, it seems the newly announced committee willing to scrutinize and limit excessive use of ministers' powers to amend secondary legislation, known as \"Henry VIII powers,\" appears to have quelled the would-be troublemakers’ concerns.",

The trainers are top-notch, very polished and dedicated professionals, yet even they, especially when performing the frog squat, seem comical.

Each step we take is with your well-being in mind, a pledge to equip you with the necessary tools to navigate through life's challenges.\n\n\nEveryday life for us involves constant navigation around this reality of your condition, adapting and ensuring that you do not miss out on anything life has to offer.

Every decision we've taken so far was to ensure you lead a fulfilling life, where your condition does not make you feel isolated or different from others. Each step we take is with your well-being in mind, a pledge to equip you with the necessary tools to navigate through life's challenges.\n\n\nEveryday life for us involves constant navigation around this reality of your condition, adapting and ensuring that you do not miss out on anything life has to offer. We immerse ourselves in the world of inclusive practices, ensuring that whatever environment you find yourself in, your needs are fully accommodated. Community support and technology play a significant role in our efforts to bridge every gap, ensuring your childhood, though unique, is as bright and colorful as it should be.\n\n\nWe have always felt more gratitude than sorrow about your condition, as it has led us to be more aware and sensitive to the needs of those around us. It has opened our eyes to the unseen and often neglected aspects of everyday life that affect individuals differently. This journey has not only been transformative for our understanding but has also deepened our resolve to support you unconditionally, through every phase of your life.\n\n\nTrain is the right metaphor for the journey we are on, with ups and downs that we must navigate together as a family. Each station is a new stage, a new skill set, a new challenge faced and overcome. Like passengers embarking on a long and enriching journey, we are confident that this path, though uncharted, will lead to new vistas and opportunities, making your life a beautiful tapestry of experiences and lessons.",

Trump said that either Congress or US allies should fix the “serious flaws” in the deal, or he would “terminate it. The Senate has since opted out of dealing with the matter, and Washington’s allies have insisted that the 2015 agreement cannot be renegotiated.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Although football has long been America’s favorite child among professional sports, there are clear indicators that the ole pigskin is starting to deflate in fans’ eyes. Football fanatics need not panic: polls show it’s still far ahead of both baseball and basketball in popularity. The 2017 NBA finals averaged 20.4m viewers (a 20-year record), which is roughly the same as the NFL’s regular Sunday night audience of 20.3m, and nowhere near the 2016 Super Bowl über-audience of 111m. Based on just those numbers, football is still kicking professional basketball, baseball and hockey through the goal posts. But America can be fickle. And the Magic 8-Ball of our cultural zeitgeist says, “All signs point to the NBA replacing the NFL as the league of America’s future.” This prediction has nothing to do with the athletes themselves, their level of skill, their heart, or their commitment to their sport. Professional athletes are generally the highest expression of what the human body is capable of doing and therefore inspiring to the fans to reach higher and strive harder. In that way, no sport is superior to any other sport. But when it comes to professional sports, some are more inspirational, more exciting and more entertaining to the general public than others and those sports take on a symbolic meaning for Americans. They come to represent our core values.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['bag', 'edge', 'kiss', 'passenger', 'wear'] in the response.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Although football has long been America’s favorite child among professional sports, there are clear indicators that the ole pigskin is starting to deflate in fans’ eyes. Football fanatics need not panic: polls show it’s still far ahead of both baseball and basketball in popularity. The 2017 NBA finals averaged 20.4m viewers (a 20-year record), which is roughly the same as the NFL’s regular Sunday night audience of 20.3m, and nowhere near the 2016 Super Bowl über-audience of 111m. Based on just those numbers, football is still kicking professional basketball, baseball and hockey through the goal posts. But America can be fickle. And the Magic 8-Ball of our cultural zeitgeist says, “All signs point to the NBA replacing the NFL as the league of America’s future.” This prediction has nothing to do with the athletes themselves, their level of skill, their heart, or their commitment to their sport. Professional athletes are generally the highest expression of what the human body is capable of doing and therefore inspiring to the fans to reach higher and strive harder. In that way, no sport is superior to any other sport. But when it comes to professional sports, some are more inspirational, more exciting and more entertaining to the general public than others and those sports take on a symbolic meaning for Americans. They come to represent our core values.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['bag', 'edge', 'kiss', 'passenger', 'wear'] in the response. Your response should contain at least 13 sentences. Your answer must contain exactly 3 bullet points.

    "response":"Despite football traditionally stealing the spotlight as America’s darling of professional sports, recent trends suggest a shift in the audience's affection, much like a bag whose charm starts to wear thin after years on the shelf. Basketball, however, is seen as a potential rising star with the possibility of outshining football in the future. This isn't to say that football's reign is immediately in jeopardy; statistics highlight that reporting about a decline might be premature. Recent numbers reveal that the NBA's finals had a fairly consistent viewership of 20.4 million in 2017, exactly in line with the NFL's Sunday night audience of 20.3 million viewers, but nowhere close to the NFL's monumental Super Bowl viewership record of 111 million in 2016. Merely considering these figures, football still holds an edge over basketball, baseball, and even hockey. However, American tastes can often be as unpredictable as a spontaneous kiss or a sudden car passenger, changing course without much warning.\n\n* The future of professional sports in America could see basketball overtaking football in a symbolic shift akin to a handbag becoming more in-style than a briefcase.\n* Underlying this potential shift is not about the innate abilities or dedication of the athletes but rather the emotive and engaging aspects of the sport that capture the public's attention.\n* Like a piece of clothing, sports can reflect and signify core American values, indicating what's in vogue and what's being left behind in the past.\n\nThe heart of this potential change isn't rooted in the athletes' skill or effort but in how the games themselves resonate with the broader audience. Sports that can connect deeply with the masses not only captivate fans but also embody and sometimes define cultural virtues. Just as trends in fashion suggest changes in societal norms, the rise and fall of sports in the public's eye can signal broader shifts in what Americans value and aspire to.\n\nP.S.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The career of Keith Chegwin, who has died aged 60, is characterised by having presented both one of the most popular children’s TV shows in history and a contender for the medium’s most notorious adult entertainment. Viewers saw the best of him in Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (BBC1, 1976-82) and its successor, Saturday Superstore (1982-87), on which Chegwin became an honorary big brother to several generations of goggle-eyed British children, through his cheeky grin and giggle, high-pitched Liverpudlian-accented enthusiasm, and psychedelic knitwear. His presentational worst occurred when Chegwin threw off the novelty sweaters – and, indeed, all clothing except a hat – to front the naturist show Naked (Channel 5, 2000), described by a parliamentarian at the time as the “most disgusting programme ever shown” on British TV. But, while he should be remembered for the work he did with his jolly jumpers on, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for Chegwin, even in his most desperate televisual enterprises. This was due to a natural likability. Only the most sympathetic TV presenters earn nicknames from viewers, and, just as Bruce Forsyth transmuted into “Brucie”, Chegwin rapidly and indelibly became “Cheggers”. That identity was cemented by the title of the third huge success of his children’s career: the music-based gameshow, Cheggers Plays Pop (BBC1, 1978-86), which extended his presenting empire to weekdays. In less prosperous times, though, audiences also admired the impressive and affecting determination with which Cheggers, in the three decades after his Saturday morning career ended, tried to reinvent himself, often against considerable odds. In addition to a common problem for children’s presenters – becoming too old to maintain the required fantasy-sibling dynamic – Chegwin suffered health problems, including alcoholism. Apart from the established presenter-rehab route of reality TV – appearing on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity MasterChef – Chegwin also offered ironic spins on his showbiz rise and fall in 10 projects, including Ricky Gervais’s Extras and Life’s Too Short, and Kill Keith (2011), an improbable comedy-horror Brit film spoof of Tarantino’s Kill Bill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Four fire engines were called to a street in Walkden, Greater Manchester, after the fire broke out at the house at about 5am on Monday. A 14-year-old girl was declared dead at the scene and an eight-year-old boy and seven-year-old girl died in hospital. A three-year-old girl was said to be in a critical condition on Monday afternoon, while a woman, 35, who is understood to be the children’s mother, was in a serious condition. Police are yet to formally identify the victims, but the mother and her 14-year-old daughter have been named locally as Michelle Pearson, 35, and Demi Pearson. Drew Povey, the headteacher at Harrop Fold school in Little Hulton, where Demi was a pupil, said: “We are devastated at the tragic loss of life today in our community. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family involved.” Greater Manchester police said they had arrested three men, aged 23, 20 and 18, and a 20-year-old woman on Monday on suspicion of murder. A 24-year-old man is also being questioned in custody on suspicion of assisting an offender. Police had previously urged a murder suspect to hand himself in, saying there was “an active manhunt” to find an individual who they did not name. “All I would say is he knows who he is and he should give himself up immediately,” said Ch Supt Wayne Miller.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "filtered_answer":"\"Four individuals, including a woman, have been apprehended by the police in connection with a fatal fire that occurred in Salford, suspected to be an arson attack. This event, which unfolded at around 5am on Monday, involved four fire engines dispatched to address a blaze at a residence in Walkden, Greater Manchester. Tragic losses of life include a girl who was only 14 years old and two young children, an eight-year-old boy and a seven-year-old girl, all of whom succumbed to their injuries. A three-year-old girl is still battling for her life, while a 35-year-old woman, who is believed to be the children’s mother, is reported to be in a serious condition.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is to launch plans for an opt-out system of organ donation, asking people to overcome their “fatal reluctance” to discuss the issue with family and friends. Under the plans, everybody in England would be presumed to be happy to donate their organs on their death, unless they have signed up to a register stating that they do not want that to happen. In practice, however, it is unlikely that organs would be taken against the wishes of the family. The government’s ambition to change the NHS organ donation programme was announced by Theresa May in her Conservative party conference speech in October. Last year, she said, “500 people died because a suitable organ was not available. And there are 6,500 on the transplant list today.” NHS Blood and Transplant’s figures show that 1,100 families in the UK decided not to allow organ donation because they were unsure, or did not know whether their relatives would have wanted to donate an organ or not. “Every day, three people die for want of a transplant, which is why our historic plans to transform the way organ donation works are so important. We want as many people as possible to have their say as we shape the new opt-out process,” said Hunt. “As well as changing the law, we also need to change the conversation – it can be a difficult subject to broach, but overcoming this fatal reluctance to talk openly about our wishes is key to saving many more lives in the future.” The consultation will ask three questions: how much say should families have in their deceased relative’s decision to donate their organs? When would exemptions to “opt-out” be needed, and what safeguards will be necessary?\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Answer with less than 271 words.

That’s why we should set a new ambition for Britain: to become the world’s leading digital economy. Today there are just 1.5 million jobs in the digital economy. That’s about 4% of the workforce. But here’s the key point: digital jobs pay 40% more than the average wage. That’s more than £190 a week.

The Tories have given us a recovery that is worse than the one in the 1930s that followed the Great Depression. And families won’t see any improvement in living standards until 2022. That’s why we should set a new ambition for Britain: to become the world’s leading digital economy. Today there are just 1.5 million jobs in the digital economy. That’s about 4% of the workforce. But here’s the key point: digital jobs pay 40% more than the average wage. That’s more than £190 a week. So transforming the number of digital jobs in our economy is one of the fastest ways we can give Britain a pay rise.

Spend a week at the Vinpearl Phu Quoc Resort, perched on the edge of Bai Dai Beach, with idyllic views of the Gulf of Thailand from almost every angle. • £859pp all-inclusive at Vinpearl Phu Quoc Resort, including return flights, with Tui Best for peace and quiet: Cyprus The island of Cyprus has one of the mildest winters in the Med and – if you stay away from the big resorts which seem a bit forlorn in low season – there is much to offer independent travellers, from Byzantine churches to ancient mountain villages. In the hamlet of Psematismenos, Modus Vivendi’s one-bed apartments make a good low-key base: a collection of six stone cottages set around a small pool and flower-filled terrace. Interiors are rustic with stone-flagged floors and beamed ceilings. The coast is 3km away and the bright lights of Larnaca, Limassol and Nicosia within a 30-minute drive. • From £80 a night at Modus Vivendi though i-escape. Flights to Larnaca cost from £69 return with easyJet Best for value: Sri Lanka If the slick five-star resorts of the Seychelles and Maldives are beyond your budget, consider Sri Lanka – same white-sand beaches and clear Indian Ocean waters, but for a fraction of the price.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Expect powdery white palm-fringed sands, clear warm waters and excellent diving. Spend a week at the Vinpearl Phu Quoc Resort, perched on the edge of Bai Dai Beach, with idyllic views of the Gulf of Thailand from almost every angle. • £859pp all-inclusive at Vinpearl Phu Quoc Resort, including return flights, with Tui Best for peace and quiet: Cyprus The island of Cyprus has one of the mildest winters in the Med and – if you stay away from the big resorts which seem a bit forlorn in low season – there is much to offer independent travellers, from Byzantine churches to ancient mountain villages. In the hamlet of Psematismenos, Modus Vivendi’s one-bed apartments make a good low-key base: a collection of six stone cottages set around a small pool and flower-filled terrace. Interiors are rustic with stone-flagged floors and beamed ceilings. The coast is 3km away and the bright lights of Larnaca, Limassol and Nicosia within a 30-minute drive. • From £80 a night at Modus Vivendi though i-escape. Flights to Larnaca cost from £69 return with easyJet Best for value: Sri Lanka If the slick five-star resorts of the Seychelles and Maldives are beyond your budget, consider Sri Lanka – same white-sand beaches and clear Indian Ocean waters, but for a fraction of the price.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n When Carla Bruni, the Italian-born, French-raised heiress and supermodel quit the catwalk to reinvent herself as a singer-songwriter 20 years ago, many thought it would be short-lived dilettantism. Yet Bruni surprised her detractors, showing herself to be a talented songwriter and a careful, nuanced singer whose jazzy chansons soon topped the French charts. She has continued to do so, even after the inevitable hiatus to her musical career caused by marrying Nicolas Sarkozy, and spending 2008-12 in the Élysée as France’s first lady. She has spoken of suffering from crippling stage fright, but this still-gamine figure, fronting a four-piece, light-jazz band, exudes preternatural poise. Bruni moves with beatific grace, recalling Karl Lagerfeld’s praise of her as “this beautiful creature who can wear anything”; her husky whisper could be a parody of a breathy Gallic siren. Her latest album is a set of cover versions sung in English, French Touch, which is a decidedly mixed bag. It largely works because Bruni pours herself into the songs as if in thrall to them: her pitch-perfect, sparse croon through Depeche Mode’s Enjoy the Silence identifies and amplifies the bleak yearning at the song’s core. The quirky arrangements can be eccentric. Bruni’s cod-jazz take on Willie Nelson’s Crazy veers near to lift muzak, while the jaunty noodling her band introduce to Lou Reed’s Perfect Day sounds at odds with the song’s dark soul. The Clash’s Jimmy Jazz is transformed into a previously unknown genre that can only be described as ethereal boogie-woogie.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n “I want to die.” Rob and Claire Johnson’s daughter was screaming, hysterical and inconsolable. Ten-year-old Emily told them a boy at school had slapped her, hard, across the face: “I want to die. Nobody believes me. He’s hitting me and nobody believes me.” “We didn’t know what to do,” Rob tells me, his voice echoing the helplessness and frustration he felt. “Hearing her say those words – what parent wants to hear that from their 10-year-old daughter?” When Claire tried to speak to the school about the incident, they quickly dismissed it as “a misunderstanding”, telling her: “Everyone’s happy now.” But Emily was far from happy. Over the subsequent two weeks, she gradually opened up to her parents with the help of her GP. Slowly, she described how the boy in question had sexually harassed and assaulted her over the past 10 months. It emerged that another child had made a detailed report to the school after witnessing the boy intimidating and assaulting Emily. The classmate had told staff it happened in a corner of the playground known as the “sex corner”, where the boy had forced Emily against a wall, pinning her hands on either side of her as he gyrated and rubbed his body against hers. Emily closed her eyes and started crying.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['initiative', 'jacket', 'person', 'picture', 'world'] in the response.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n “I want to die.” Rob and Claire Johnson’s daughter was screaming, hysterical and inconsolable. Ten-year-old Emily told them a boy at school had slapped her, hard, across the face: “I want to die. Nobody believes me. He’s hitting me and nobody believes me.” “We didn’t know what to do,” Rob tells me, his voice echoing the helplessness and frustration he felt. “Hearing her say those words – what parent wants to hear that from their 10-year-old daughter?” When Claire tried to speak to the school about the incident, they quickly dismissed it as “a misunderstanding”, telling her: “Everyone’s happy now.” But Emily was far from happy. Over the subsequent two weeks, she gradually opened up to her parents with the help of her GP. Slowly, she described how the boy in question had sexually harassed and assaulted her over the past 10 months. It emerged that another child had made a detailed report to the school after witnessing the boy intimidating and assaulting Emily. The classmate had told staff it happened in a corner of the playground known as the “sex corner”, where the boy had forced Emily against a wall, pinning her hands on either side of her as he gyrated and rubbed his body against hers. Emily closed her eyes and started crying.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['initiative', 'jacket', 'person', 'picture', 'world'] in the response.

The anguish described presents a painful image of a child's plea for help, falling on seemingly deaf ears, until systematic intervention and open communication surfaced the real issue.\n\nSection 3\nThrough detailed consultations with Emily's general practitioner and further discussions with the school, a clearer picture of the situation emerged, unveiling acts of sexual harassment and assault that Emily had endured over an extended period. A classmate's witness statement exposed the alarming extent of the abuse, detailing incidents in a part of the playground dubbed the \"sex corner.\"\n\nSection 4\nThe person who was supposed to protect Emily failed her, reinforcing the necessity of robust child protection policies and the decisive actions of those in charge. This story highlights the importance of parents, educators, and guardians taking every child's complaint seriously and creating an environment where reporting and addressing such issues becomes a straightforward and supported initiative.\n\nSection 5\nIn a world where every child should feel safe, this case underlines the critical need for vigilance and proactive measures to ensure environments free from abuse.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Guillermo del Toro’s cold war fantasy The Shape of Water emerged as the frontrunner for the Oscars after picking up a total of seven nominations for the 75th Golden Globes. However, the film looks set to face strong opposition from Steven Spielberg’s Pentagon Papers drama The Post and Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, at a Globes ceremony that will provide the entertainment industry with its first major opportunity to respond to the sexual abuse scandal plaguing Hollywood. Two months after the emergence of allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein that would prompt a further torrent of claims against men in the film industry, the nominations exhibited an already changed landscape in Hollywood.

At the same time, the widely predicted shift towards a more female-focused list of nominees in the wake of the Weinstein scandal did not materialise. Though there were nods for a number of films with female protagonists, including The Shape of Water, Three Billboards, I, Tonya, a biopic of disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding and coming-of-age comedy-drama Lady Bird, there was no room in the nominees for any female directors, while Patty Jenkins’s feminist superhero movie Wonder Woman was snubbed entirely. Leading the way with seven nominations is the Shape of Water, which stars British actor Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaner at a governmental research facility who falls in love with a captured sea creature. Both Del Toro and Hawkins have been nominated in the drama category, for best director and best actress respectively, while Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer have received supporting actor and actress nominations. The film has also received best screenplay and score nominations, as well as best picture in the drama category.

    "response":"SECTION 1\n\nTo explore the mystery behind creative processes, one can look at an art class setting in Denver, Colorado. In this classroom, the instructor encourages students to emulate the renowned painter Vassily Kandinsky, teaching them geometric abstraction techniques, manual brush skills, and color theory. This foundational phase appears to be a traditional art history lesson by itself. However, the teacher introduces an innovative twist: she instructs the students to deconstruct their paintings and use the pieces to create 3D sculptural forms. Despite beginning with the same artistic source, the students’ final creations vary wildly in form and construction, some aiming upwards in pillar-like formations while others present as complex assemblages of various shapes and angles. Through this exercise, the students learn to view the past not just as definitive or prescribed, but as a stage from which new ideas and experiences can spring. This underscores that creativity is not a phenomenon that spontaneously arises without context, but instead grows through a process of innovation and extension based on existing knowledge and practice. Every original idea, however novel it seems, has roots or connections to what has already been known and explored before.\n\nThe art lesson in Denver exemplifies a pedagogical approach that goes beyond merely teaching the end product of artistic creation. It introduces students to the dynamic and adaptive nature of creativity, transforming them from passive consumers of art to active participants in its evolution. Through the imitation of Kandinsky's style, students grasp a fundamental concept in art: the significance of building upon前辈们的工作。然而，通过将画作解构并重新组装成三维雕塑，他们进一步学会了如何在现有的基础上进行创新，而不是简单地重复。这种教学方法证明了创造力的发展是一个逐步进化的过程，每一次突破都建立在已有的知识和技能之上。在教育中融入此类创新思维的训练，不仅仅有助于提升学生的艺术技能，更重要的是培养了他们从新角度看待问题和解决问题的能力。正如在这个艺术课堂中所展示的那样，从学习如何接触和理解前任艺术家的风格，到探索这些风格如何被彻底重塑并转化为全新的表现形式，都是创造力成长的重要步骤。这种教学实践向我们揭示了创造力不仅仅是关于产生全新的想法，更重要的是如何在这个过程中吸收、理解和转化现有的元素，创造出独一无二的作品。",

Juventus supporters filled the venue, generating a lively atmosphere through their customary pre-game choreographies, featuring black and white placards intertwined with the Italian tricolor, symbolizing their pride as reigning champions. However, the evening held unexpected nuances, with fan groups cleverly deploying a quirky banner, a cartoon detective Nick Carter, alongside Patsy and Ten, using a map of Europe with Italy marked in black and white, directing acerbic remarks to Inter’s Chinese ownership. While evident were the comedic interludes presented by such gestures, underlying this was a palpable anxiety among the Juventus supporters.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In her essays, Susan Sontag spoke with one of the great, sure voices of the last century. From her salon at the centre of the cosmopolis, marvellously at one with her books and her learning, she considered, renamed and renewed our relationship with camp, with photography, with illness: a living legend of braininess and cool. Sontag, was not, though, as her editor Benjamin Taylor admits in the introduction to this gathering of stories from across her career, a committed short-story writer. She turned to the form in order to evade what Chekhov called “autobiographophobia”, which Taylor uses to mean the fear of writing and reflecting directly about one’s life. Evading this fear, Sontag clearly found the name “stories” very helpful: half of them are pure autobiography. “Pilgrimage”, for example, which opens the volume, is a memoir of Sontag’s youth in southern California, and an account of her visit with a boyfriend to the home of an ageing Thomas Mann. The only reason why this did not become an essay, it seems, is that the encounter was dull and disappointing, and so difficult to reflect on: Mann had “only sententious formulas to deliver. And I uttered nothing but tongue-tied simplicities, though I was full of complex feeling. We were neither of us at our best.” The next piece, “Project for a Trip to China”, is also memoir: we learn more about Sontag’s childhood (she was a voracious reader and dug deep holes in the garden to sit in); about her habit of ordering ambitiously in restaurants (hundred-year-old eggs); and a little about her father, who worked in China. The piece is more experimental, using lists and tables, characters identified by initials only, and lots of negatives (she does not, predictably, go to China).\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Christmas dinner is a roast with bits added on, and the majority of a roast is vegan anyway.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The rather unexpected allusion by the prime minister this week in a speech to the Business Council of Australia to the government’s pursuit of further income tax cuts is not one that should be treated with too much respect until he also talks about how to pay for them. With the return to surplus built on income tax revenue, any income tax cuts are unlikely to come before the next decade without either increases in other taxes or big cuts to government services. Amid the usual “free markets are great” rah-rah that the prime minister doled out to the Business Council of Australia on Monday night, Malcolm Turnbull also slipped in a line on income tax cuts, noting that he was: “Actively working with the treasurer and all my cabinet colleagues to ease the burden on middle-income Australians, while also meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” This was a bit of a surprise given the current state of the budget is such that the government is projecting that a return to surplus only in 2020-21and that net debt at that point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP. Even in the best of times, promising income tax cuts as the budget is in deficit is a courageous position to take for a political party that likes to prides itself on “budget responsibility”.It is even more courageous when the path back to surplus is built on a foundation of income tax revenue. Individual’s income tax has always been the biggest tax in the budget. During the mining-boom years it declined slightly in importance as company tax exploded in value from 3.3% of GDP in 1998-99 to5.3% of GDP in 2005-06. But in the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for just over half of all tax revenue. Now that in itself is a bit of a problem (the IMF and OECD have made calls for Australia to lessen its reliance on income tax) but it is a bigger problem for Turnbull and his call for tax cuts while also “meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” The issue it that of the extra $88.1bn in tax revenue the government hopes to gain between now and 2020-21, $48.5bn of it is to come from individual income tax. This means that income tax is actually bearing a greater burden of the increase in tax than would be expected. Income tax makes up 50.6% of total tax revenue, but accounts for 55% of the increase in tax revenue between now and 2020-21.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Olivia Mead, a millionaire heiress whose list of expenses included a $1.2m crystal-encrusted grand piano and $2,000 annual upkeep of her pet axolotl, has had her inheritance cut from $25m to $6.14m following an appeal from her deceased father’s estate. The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father’s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have “any involvement or association whatsoever” with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than “traditional” Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead’s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court’s master, Craig Sanderson, said would “not fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community”. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright’s estate, acting on behalf of Wright’s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later. On Wednesday, the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court set aside Sanderson’s orders, ruling that while Sanderson was correct to say that Mead had been inadequately provided for in the original will: “The exercise of his discretion to order that provision be made for the respondent in the sum of $25m was flawed.” In a lengthy written judgment, the court found that Sanderson made a number of “material errors” in calculating the size of Mead’s inheritance, saying the focus should have been on what constituted “proper maintenance” and that the initial finding that Mead was “honest” and “not a gold-digger” were not relevant. “The capital sum should be sufficient to enable the respondent to purchase a reasonably substantial house with part of the capital sum and to invest the balance so that she will receive a reasonably substantial annuity for the remainder of her life,” the appeal court’s president, Michael Buss, said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Olivia Mead, a millionaire heiress whose list of expenses included a $1.2m crystal-encrusted grand piano and $2,000 annual upkeep of her pet axolotl, has had her inheritance cut from $25m to $6.14m following an appeal from her deceased father’s estate. The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father’s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have “any involvement or association whatsoever” with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than “traditional” Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead’s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court’s master, Craig Sanderson, said would “not fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community”. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright’s estate, acting on behalf of Wright’s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later. On Wednesday, the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court set aside Sanderson’s orders, ruling that while Sanderson was correct to say that Mead had been inadequately provided for in the original will: “The exercise of his discretion to order that provision be made for the respondent in the sum of $25m was flawed.” In a lengthy written judgment, the court found that Sanderson made a number of “material errors” in calculating the size of Mead’s inheritance, saying the focus should have been on what constituted “proper maintenance” and that the initial finding that Mead was “honest” and “not a gold-digger” were not relevant. “The capital sum should be sufficient to enable the respondent to purchase a reasonably substantial house with part of the capital sum and to invest the balance so that she will receive a reasonably substantial annuity for the remainder of her life,” the appeal court’s president, Michael Buss, said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

With Queenslanders preparing to head to the polls on Saturday, no clear victor has emerged, leaving both the LNP and Labor scrambling to bed down seats.

As the inaugural bird of the year poll launched on Monday, the nation’s celebrities, political leaders and media outlets immediately began their campaigns. The divisive Australian white ibis leapt to a commanding lead and the powerful owl, with the aid of Russian hackers, rose up the ranks. But in a crowded field of diverse native birds, endorsements rang out for nearly all contenders. The federal opposition leader, Bill Shorten, cut his ties to the magpie, currently coming second, and set his sights on the emu (whose image sits above Parliament House), in what must surely be an early election pitch. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, chose the Gang-gang cockatoo, another Canberra icon (“Incredible plumage but it sounds like a rusty door”), while fellow senator Nick McKim picked the wedge-tailed eagle, and Janet Rice, the hooded plover. Scott Ludlam, 2017’s first dual citizen, again displayed divided loyalties. The former senator endorsed the Carnaby’s black cockatoo at 3.45pm on Monday, but by 8.30pm, he suddenly declared himself “Team Bin Chicken”. Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, was asked but did not respond, opening himself up to a string of less-than-flattering replies. But the government’s leader of the house, Christopher Pyne, did tell ABC Radio’s Patricia Karvelas he liked the black-faced spoonbill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The divisive Australian white ibis leapt to a commanding lead and the powerful owl, with the aid of Russian hackers, rose up the ranks. But in a crowded field of diverse native birds, endorsements rang out for nearly all contenders. The federal opposition leader, Bill Shorten, cut his ties to the magpie, currently coming second, and set his sights on the emu (whose image sits above Parliament House), in what must surely be an early election pitch. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, chose the Gang-gang cockatoo, another Canberra icon (“Incredible plumage but it sounds like a rusty door”), while fellow senator Nick McKim picked the wedge-tailed eagle, and Janet Rice, the hooded plover. Scott Ludlam, 2017’s first dual citizen, again displayed divided loyalties. The former senator endorsed the Carnaby’s black cockatoo at 3.45pm on Monday, but by 8.30pm, he suddenly declared himself “Team Bin Chicken”. Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, was asked but did not respond, opening himself up to a string of less-than-flattering replies. But the government’s leader of the house, Christopher Pyne, did tell ABC Radio’s Patricia Karvelas he liked the black-faced spoonbill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"<<Australia's Favourite Bird Debate Heats Up>>\n\nIn a surprising twist, the struggle for the Australian public's affection for their favorite native bird has intensified. The announcement of the country’s inaugural bird of the year contest stirred immediate interest, with influential personalities, politicians, and media rapidly aligning behind their preferred candidates. Leading the pack is the controversial Australian white ibis, nicknamed the “bin chicken”, while the powerful owl seems to have captured attention in a rather unexpected manner, possibly thanks to some internet disruptions. Amidst this fierce competition, endorsements spread widely across the diverse selection of avian participants. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, pivoted his support from the currently second-ranked magpie to the emu, aligning the campaign with political aspirations. Greens leader Richard Di Natale opted for the Gang-gang cockatoo, praising its beauty, albeit with a humorous nod to its voice description. Nick McKim, another senator, chose the majestic wedge-tailed eagle, while Janet Rice selected the hooded plover.
