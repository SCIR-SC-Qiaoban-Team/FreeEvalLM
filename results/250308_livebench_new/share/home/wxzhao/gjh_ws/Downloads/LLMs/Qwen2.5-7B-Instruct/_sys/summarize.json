      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Half-submerged by a jungle and populated by cows, chickens and goats, it is one of the more unusual tourist attractions on the South Pacific island of Rarotonga: the “cursed” Sheraton hotel complex, a long-abandoned luxury resort that has lain derelict for a quarter of a century. The crumbling, graffiti-covered buildings are overgrown with creepers. The only human visitors to the 70-acre site in Vaimaanga pay a small fee to explore what has become known as the biggest white elephant in the South Pacific. The Italian-backed hotel project, which began in the late 1980s, was designed to revolutionise tourism in the remote Cook Islands by providing the tiny nation with its first five-star resort. But the house of cards collapsed at the 11th hour, with the project 80% complete, amid allegations of mafia involvement and money laundering back in Italy. The Cook Islands government was left with a debt of $120m and was almost bankrupted. In the years since, repeated attempts to finish the project have foundered, but now a new effort to salvage the buildings is under way, and could have an even bigger impact on the tiny Pacific state than the original plans were expected to. Tim Tepaki, a Cook Islander who has been involved in property development in New Zealand, claims to have hundreds of millions of dollars in Chinese backing. He hopes to rebuild the complex and turn the Pacific backwater into a favourite destination for tourists from China. Until now tourism in the Cooks – a nation of 15 islands scattered across an area the size of India – has relied mainly on visitors from Australia and New Zealand, who tend to focus on the capital Rarotonga and the atoll of Aitutaki, a 50-minute flight north.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Pauline Hanson has likened the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, to a “spoilt brat” for ruling out a deal with One Nation. Arriving in Bundaberg just as the Labor campaign left, Hanson, who remains the most visible One Nation asset in Queensland, despite not running in Saturday’s state election, lashed out at Palaszczuk’s continued criticism of the party. Palaszczuk’s insistence that Labor would rather go into opposition than form government with One Nation has become its strongest attack line against the Liberal National party, which is directly preferencing One Nation in 50 of the 61 seats it is running in, as well as admitting, indirectly, it would form government with One Nation, if necessary. The opposition leader, Tim Nicholls, who has previously said he would work with the parliament Queenslanders delivered, was unable to answer “yes or no” to the question of whether he would form government with One Nation on Tuesday during a radio quiz, instead opting for “pass”. Hanson has responded with the line that the major parties are choosing not to respect the will of the people, in the same way Donald Trump’s campaign used Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment against the Democrat campaign last year. “I don’t think the premier knows what she is doing actually, I think she is in such a turmoil over this and she is actually needs to get out of the sandpit and be the leader for this state,” Hanson said. “Because the way she is carrying on, it is not leadership, it is not quality. “To say you won’t work with One Nation, it is just ridiculous. It’s like a spoilt brat, she is carrying on like a spoilt kid, and if that is what leadership means then I think she is heading down the wrong path and Tim Nicholls, he needs to grow up and make a decision, because people want clear decision in this state.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Disney Animation head John Lasseter will take a six-month leave of absence after confessing to unspecified “missteps”. In a company memo, obtained by the Hollywood Reporter, Lasseter writes that he has fallen short in creating a culture that engenders “support and collaboration” and hints at behavior that he has been confronted about. “I’ve recently had a number of difficult conversations that have been very painful for me,” he writes. “It’s never easy to face your missteps, but it’s the only way to learn from them. As a result, I’ve been giving a lot of thought to the leader I am today compared to the mentor, advocate and champion I want to be. It’s been brought to my attention that I have made some of you feel disrespected or uncomfortable. That was never my intent.” Lasseter, who is one of the founders of Pixar and the director of Toy Story, also apologizes for letting employees down while adding more details about the conduct that has led to him taking a sabbatical. “I especially want to apologize to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form,” he writes. “No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.” In a statement, a Disney spokesperson responded: “We are committed to maintaining an environment in which all employees are respected and empowered to do their best work. We appreciate John’s candor and sincere apology and fully support his sabbatical.” The memo has arrived at the same time as an investigation by the Hollywood Reporter into complaints about Lasseter’s behavior.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Disney Animation head John Lasseter will take a six-month leave of absence after confessing to unspecified “missteps”. In a company memo, obtained by the Hollywood Reporter, Lasseter writes that he has fallen short in creating a culture that engenders “support and collaboration” and hints at behavior that he has been confronted about. “I’ve recently had a number of difficult conversations that have been very painful for me,” he writes. “It’s never easy to face your missteps, but it’s the only way to learn from them. As a result, I’ve been giving a lot of thought to the leader I am today compared to the mentor, advocate and champion I want to be. It’s been brought to my attention that I have made some of you feel disrespected or uncomfortable. That was never my intent.” Lasseter, who is one of the founders of Pixar and the director of Toy Story, also apologizes for letting employees down while adding more details about the conduct that has led to him taking a sabbatical. “I especially want to apologize to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form,” he writes. “No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.” In a statement, a Disney spokesperson responded: “We are committed to maintaining an environment in which all employees are respected and empowered to do their best work. We appreciate John’s candor and sincere apology and fully support his sabbatical.” The memo has arrived at the same time as an investigation by the Hollywood Reporter into complaints about Lasseter’s behavior.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Australia’s race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, says the high no vote in western Sydney in last week’s historic same-sex marriage postal survey reflects religious observance rather than ethnicity, and he has warned against an outbreak of crass, cultural stereotyping. Soutphommasane used a speech at the University of Western Sydney to issue a pointed warning against adopting “easy narratives” devoid of evidence about the behaviour or inclinations of particular ethnic groups in Australia. “In a world that many describe as post-truth or post-factual, our social cohesion is not always well served by jumping to conclusions,” he said. “Once-appealing narratives take hold, they can help fuel stereotypes about others – and these can be difficult to shake off. Sometimes this is because they may conveniently help to confirm cultural hierarchies in our society.” Soutphommasane said a narrative has sprung up since the postal survey which centres on ethnic minorities or multicultural communities being intrinsically hostile towards same-sex marriage, and to the LGBTI community at large. He said while some ethnic communities hold to the view that marriage is between a man and a woman, that view is shaped often by religious or cultural traditions. The race commissioner said a more clear-eyed examination of the postal survey data suggests religiosity, or religious observance, was a more significant factor for no voters – a fact well understood by the no campaign, which targeted messages to a range of communities in Sydney’s west. Soutphommasane said if you look at the voting trends outside western Sydney, a more mixed picture emerges – a picture where seats with populations of more than 40% born overseas overwhelmingly voted yes. He pointed out that the most multicultural electorates in New South Wales and Victoria recorded high yes votes – seats like Sydney, Grayndler, Kingsford Smith, Bradfield, Batman, Wills, Gellibrand and Chisholm. “To suggest that an overwhelming majority of multicultural communities voted no – and did so out of some essential cultural hostility against gays and lesbians – is to entertain something that comes close to an unkind stereotype,” the race commissioner said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Thousands of miles away in Beijing – for years Mugabe’s most powerful backer – there were no obvious signs of jubilation. “China respects Mr Mugabe’s decision to resign,” foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters, praising his “historic contribution” to Zimbabwe’s liberation. “He remains a good friend of the Chinese people.” But experts believe China’s leaders will be both relieved and contented to see the back of “Comrade Bob” – a suspicion reinforced by the approving tone coverage of his demise has taken in the Communist party-controlled press. “We need change in our country,” China’s official news agency Xinhua – whose correspondents’ dispatches are expected, above all else, to reflect the party line – quoted one Zimbabwean teacher as saying of Mugabe’s resignation. “We’re very happy,” another Zimbabwean told party mouthpiece the People’s Daily. “Finally things will change.” Ross Anthony, an expert in China-Africa relations from South Africa’s Stellenbosch University, said that while Beijing had backed Mugabe since his days as a Marxist revolutionary in the 1970s, it had increasingly seen him as erratic, an embarrassment and a threat to Chinese investments. A case in point was Mugabe’s controversial indigenisation law, which required all foreign companies to be controlled by Zimbabweans and was a particular blow to Chinese interests in its diamond industry. “I imagine there are quite a lot of officials in Beijing who will be happy to see Mugabe go,” Anthony said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Confirmation of Robert Mugabe’s ouster prompted revelry on the streets of Harare. “The Goblin has gone!” raved one. Thousands of miles away in Beijing – for years Mugabe’s most powerful backer – there were no obvious signs of jubilation. “China respects Mr Mugabe’s decision to resign,” foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters, praising his “historic contribution” to Zimbabwe’s liberation. “He remains a good friend of the Chinese people.” But experts believe China’s leaders will be both relieved and contented to see the back of “Comrade Bob” – a suspicion reinforced by the approving tone coverage of his demise has taken in the Communist party-controlled press. “We need change in our country,” China’s official news agency Xinhua – whose correspondents’ dispatches are expected, above all else, to reflect the party line – quoted one Zimbabwean teacher as saying of Mugabe’s resignation. “We’re very happy,” another Zimbabwean told party mouthpiece the People’s Daily. “Finally things will change.” Ross Anthony, an expert in China-Africa relations from South Africa’s Stellenbosch University, said that while Beijing had backed Mugabe since his days as a Marxist revolutionary in the 1970s, it had increasingly seen him as erratic, an embarrassment and a threat to Chinese investments. A case in point was Mugabe’s controversial indigenisation law, which required all foreign companies to be controlled by Zimbabweans and was a particular blow to Chinese interests in its diamond industry. “I imagine there are quite a lot of officials in Beijing who will be happy to see Mugabe go,” Anthony said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Patients are being put at risk because doctors are giving them drugs they do not need and sending them for unnecessary surgery to avoid a complaint being made against them, research has revealed. Medics are so scared of being complained about that they are also giving patients more tests than their symptoms merit and not performing procedures that involve more risk than usual. Four out of five doctors who become the subject of a complaint find the experience so stressful that they start practising more “defensive medicine” than before, according to a survey of 6,144 doctors in Britain about whom a patient, relative or colleague had complained. “This involved ‘hedging’, which includes performing more tests than necessary, over-referral and overprescribing as well as ‘avoidance’, which includes avoiding procedures, not accepting high-risk patients or abandoning procedures early,” according to research by a team led by Prof Tom Bourne of Imperial College London, whose findings have been published in the journal BMJ Open. “These behaviours may have a serious impact on patient care,” they warned. While litigation, complaints and investigations are intended to protect patients from poor care and medical negligence, the “burden and stress associated with these processes are clearly having unintended consequences and it may be argued that when examined as a whole, these structures may be causing more harm to patient care than good,” the study said. “While the regulatory system may protect patients from the misconduct of a relatively small number of doctors, it has a perverse effect on the majority of doctors who become preoccupied by defensive practice,” it added. Doctors who resort to “fear-driven working practices that could compromise patient care” also waste vital resources and their conduct “creates significant costs for the NHS”, the co-authors added. Bourne could not quantify how much NHS spending goes on that, but pointed to a study that found such practices accounted for 10% of Italy’s health budget. The General Medical Council, which regulates Britain’s 250,000 doctors, receives 9,000-10,000 complaints a year.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Nick Xenophon Team senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore will resign from the Senate because she has dual British citizenship by descent through her mother. At a press conference in Adelaide on Wednesday, Kakoschke-Moore announced she had received advice from the UK Home Office on Friday, confirmed by a specialist barrister, that she had received British citizenship from her mother, who was born in Singapore in 1957. Kakoschke-Moore had always believed she was not British because her father had received advice from the British embassy in Oman she was not eligible for citizenship when she was 12. She said she was “heartbroken” to discover she was British, which she described as “extremely surprising” because she “had no reason to believe I was a British citizen until that point”. Kakoschke-Moore explained that her mother was born in Singapore, a former British colony, which gave her “citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies” and became a British citizen in 1983 when the British Nationality Act came into effect. Kakoschke-Moore, born in Darwin in 1985, then gained that citizenship by descent. Kakoschke-Moore said she would request the matter be referred to the high court to determine how the vacancy would be filled, adding she would “continue to run” for the NXT and “at this stage” her ambition was to come back to the Senate. A recount of the 2016 Senate election would likely elect the NXT candidate Tim Storrer, who unsuccessfully attempted to replace Xenophon in the Senate by challenging the party’s chosen successor. Xenophon said he and his colleagues were “devastated” by the loss of Kakoschke-Moore from the Senate, but predicted it was “not the end of her political career”. Xenophon said the party had preliminary legal advice the position may not be filled by a recount, claiming the situation was “uncharted legal territory” because of the high court’s recent decision involving Hollie Hughes.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Two Manusian men – Catholic priest Father Clement Taulam and retired army major Michael Kuweh – are defying the PNG and Australian governments in calling for assistance for the refugees and asylum seekers on Manus, and for a peaceable solution to the standoff inside the condemned Australian-run detention centre. Speaking at his Papitalai parish church on Los Negros Island, across a small bay from the detention centre, Taulam said the enforced shutdown of the centre – in which 380 men remain – had left people vulnerable and suffering. Over years of pastoral care, he has built up friendships with many of those in the centre, he told the Guardian and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. “Now when they say they have no food, no water, no lights, they are deprived physically but they are saying too, that the physical is also spiritual for them. They are deprived of faith. They are suffering.” Taulam said no government seemed willing to take care of the men who remain in the centre. “Australia seems to be saying, ‘Papua New Guinea, this is your responsibility’. And Papua New Guinea is saying to Australia, ‘Do your work, clean up your mess.’ And while this is going on, these people are suffering.” “I’ve been talking with them, going to see them.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Late last year, the Electoral Commission started an investigation into a striking set of circumstances. In February 2016 Steve Baker MP, lobbying for Vote Leave to be designated the “official” leave campaign, sent a round robin email asking recipients to support it, because it claimed to have found a loophole in the spending rules. “It is open to the Vote Leave family to create separate legal entities each of which could spend £700k: Vote Leave will be able to spend as much money as is necessary to win the referendum,” he wrote. But Baker – now a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) – got it wrong. The law that protects our democracy from capture appears to make this behaviour illegal: when a sockpuppet signs your cheques, the spending still counts as yours. The Electoral Commission knew about Baker’s email – it was reported in the Times. But despite knowing that Vote Leave appeared to have contemplated acting unlawfully, the Electoral Commission went ahead and designated it as the official leave campaign. Then we come to the referendum campaign. With under a month to go, Vote Leave was bumping up against the limits of what it could lawfully spend. But it had plenty of money left over from wealthy donors.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.  Wrap your entire response with double quotation marks.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Late last year, the Electoral Commission started an investigation into a striking set of circumstances. In February 2016 Steve Baker MP, lobbying for Vote Leave to be designated the “official” leave campaign, sent a round robin email asking recipients to support it, because it claimed to have found a loophole in the spending rules. “It is open to the Vote Leave family to create separate legal entities each of which could spend £700k: Vote Leave will be able to spend as much money as is necessary to win the referendum,” he wrote. But Baker – now a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) – got it wrong. The law that protects our democracy from capture appears to make this behaviour illegal: when a sockpuppet signs your cheques, the spending still counts as yours. The Electoral Commission knew about Baker’s email – it was reported in the Times. But despite knowing that Vote Leave appeared to have contemplated acting unlawfully, the Electoral Commission went ahead and designated it as the official leave campaign. Then we come to the referendum campaign. With under a month to go, Vote Leave was bumping up against the limits of what it could lawfully spend. But it had plenty of money left over from wealthy donors.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.  Wrap your entire response with double quotation marks.

Ruddock’s appointment by cabinet, announced on Wednesday, is designed to head off a bruising debate about religious amendments in a same-sex marriage bill, but the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the review was “no substitute” for those amendments. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said it was important to look at the issue of religious freedom carefully, in light of the yes vote and impending legislation on marriage equality.

Ruddock has been asked to report by 31 March. Turnbull said a variety of proposals for legislative changes to protect freedom of religion have been put forward in recent months but many of them go beyond the immediate issue of marriage, and parliament needed to be wary of them. “Any reforms to protect religious freedom at large should be undertaken carefully,” he said in a statement on Wednesday. “There is a high risk of unintended consequences when parliament attempts to legislate protections for basic rights and freedoms, such as freedom of religion. The government is particularly concerned to prevent uncertainties caused by generally worded bill of rights-style declarations. “This will be a timely expert stocktake to inform consideration of any necessary legislative reforms.” Turnbull said Ruddock was the right person to conduct the review because he had served as Australia’s special envoy for human rights.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Last weekend Faced with a quiet moment, Donald Trump tends to stir up a spat with a sports star or a celebrity, seemingly in order to open new fronts in America’s “culture wars” and reassure his base about which side he’s on.

The previous round of talks in May failed to reach an agreement. The goalkeeper, who spent three successful years on loan at Atlético Madrid after joining Chelsea from Genk, has been an integral part of the team who have won two Premier League titles in the past three seasons. His agent, Christophe Henrotay, held talks with the champions towards the end of last season, seeking to take the Belgian’s wages closer to the £200,000 a week level enjoyed by Eden Hazard at Stamford Bridge and another of the division’s elite goalkeepers, David de Gea, at Manchester United. Although Courtois – who kept 16 clean sheets in the league last season – is happy at Chelsea and willing to sign improved terms, he has regularly expressed his fondness for life in La Liga, where his situation continues to be monitored by a number of clubs, notably Real Madrid. His former girlfriend has returned to Spain with the couple’s two children. Chelsea are well aware of interest in him from Spanish clubs and will be anxious to achieve a positive resolution before the player goes into the final year of his deal, potentially damaging his value and their bargaining position. “The most important thing is to perform well for myself and the team,” said Courtois before the Champions League game against Qarabag. “Regarding my contract, that’s something where Chelsea must deal with my agent.

    "response":"The opening sentences of the article from The Guardian seem to be an excerpt from a satirical piece, likely a parody or mocking some aspect of a cookery show with a twist on classic euphemisms and references. The text begins with a playful and somewhat crude celebration of \"Deathless,\" a concept that appears to be an annual event in the culinary world, as indicated by the mention of \"_hours of:,\" suggesting a format that outlines different segments or dishes.\n\nThe piece humorously pairs unconventional ingredients and cooking techniques with oddly tailored attire, such as Tim Lovejoy’s \"distressed chambray\" shirts, hinting towards a creative and eccentric figure in the culinary world. The text also cleverly references popular cookery shows and their hosts, like \"Saturday Kitchen\" and \"James Martin,\" interweaving these with the broader theme of a cookery show that takes a cheeky, somewhat deranged, perspective.\n\nThe excerpt's most notable element is its satirical take on the standard cookery show format, where ingredients and their preparation methods are presented in a way that is deliberately awkward and absurd. For instance, the mention of \"Scallops in chino runoff\" or \"Jerusalem artichokes\" as a bizarre and inexplicable choice of ingredient, which is juxtaposed with the serious and pulled-together appearance of the chefs in their “distressed chambray.”\n\nThe text highlights a conflict between the creativity and eccentricity that can be found in cookery (isosceles to the rhetorical question \"What is that all about then?\"), and the established norms or pressures within the industry. This creative tension is amplified by a series of euphemisms and off-color references, such as \"Priapic jackanapes\" and a glorification of buttocks, suggesting that the show is about more than just cooking.\n\nAnother aspect of the text is the creation of a sense of unease and perhaps humor at the absurdist portrayal of a cookery show, where the chefs’ reactions to these unconventional ingredients seem preposterous, adhering to the question \"because Jerusalem artichokes? What is that all about then?\" This creates an atmosphere of a cousin to the typical earnestness in these shows, showing a new and creative way to approach the discussion of ingredients and the profession of cooking.\n\nThe text also uses a specific cooking technique, a \"Lynx Sport Blast® reduction,\" which, from the name, seems to be a humorous or exaggerated term, perhaps taken from a product name, indicating a creative side often seen in culinary shows. Key figures in the text are also personified in a way that reflects the creative and quirky nature of the show, like the \"hauntingly narrow kitchen at other uneasy men in distressed chambray.\"\n\nThe piece concludes by reinforcing the idea that this show, while perhaps a bit absurd, is a celebration of creativity in the culinary arts. It uses memorable and evocative language, such as \"folding their arms and rocking with mirthless laughter,\" which not only paints a picture but also suggests a tension between absurdity and seriousness in the culinary world. Overall, this excerpt from the article encapsulates a creative and satirical take on the cookery show format, blending absurdity, specificity, and a playful use of language to comment on the quirks and joys of the culinary arts.",

This creative tension is amplified by a series of euphemisms and off-color references, such as \"Priapic jackanapes\" and a glorification of buttocks, suggesting that the show is about more than just cooking.\n\nAnother aspect of the text is the creation of a sense of unease and perhaps humor at the absurdist portrayal of a cookery show, where the chefs’ reactions to these unconventional ingredients seem preposterous, adhering to the question \"because Jerusalem artichokes? What is that all about then?\" This creates an atmosphere of a cousin to the typical earnestness in these shows, showing a new and creative way to approach the discussion of ingredients and the profession of cooking.\n\nThe text also uses a specific cooking technique, a \"Lynx Sport Blast® reduction,\" which, from the name, seems to be a humorous or exaggerated term, perhaps taken from a product name, indicating a creative side often seen in culinary shows. Key figures in the text are also personified in a way that reflects the creative and quirky nature of the show, like the \"hauntingly narrow kitchen at other uneasy men in distressed chambray.\"\n\nThe piece concludes by reinforcing the idea that this show, while perhaps a bit absurd, is a celebration of creativity in the culinary arts. It uses memorable and evocative language, such as \"folding their arms and rocking with mirthless laughter,\" which not only paints a picture but also suggests a tension between absurdity and seriousness in the culinary world. Overall, this excerpt from the article encapsulates a creative and satirical take on the cookery show format, blending absurdity, specificity, and a playful use of language to comment on the quirks and joys of the culinary arts.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Unity Spencer, who has died aged 87, was perhaps best known for being the daughter of the artist Stanley Spencer, but she was also a talented painter in her own right, a skilful realist with a powerful imaginative vision. Two of her best and most memorable works, which reveal her father’s influence, are a striking self-portrait from 1954, and a 1957 portrait of Stanley himself. She had three solo shows of her paintings in London, and contributed to many mixed exhibitions, from the London Group to the Royal Academy shows. The first of her one-person shows was at Lauderdale House in Highgate, in 1993, the second at the Boundary Gallery in St John’s Wood in 2001, both in north London, but it was the third that really established her reputation. In 2015, the Fine Art Society in Bond Street mounted the first West End exhibition of her work, to coincide with the publication of her autobiography, Lucky to Be an Artist. Fifty of her paintings from all periods were shown along with her etchings, accompanied by a group of pictures by her family: works by her parents, her uncles Gilbert Spencer and Richard Carline, and by her grandfather George Carline. This show came at the suggestion of a friend, the painter David Inshaw. He recalled visiting her house in Clapham (where, according to her son, she had inscribed “Daring, Joy and Love” on her bedroom wall), expecting to find it hung with paintings by herself and her parents. But the walls were oddly bare, with not even her own work in sight. The public has always been more interested in the Spencer\/Carline family’s eccentric lifestyle than in the art produced and Unity spent a substantial part of her life explaining if not defending her parents.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Traditional cider makers have warned they will be unfairly penalised by a tax on super-strength cider, as the rest of the drinks industry toasted the budget freeze on alcohol duty. The chancellor unveiled plans, including a new duty band on still cider and perry with an alcohol content between 6.9% and 7.5%, in a move the Treasury said was aimed at “white cider”. White cider is often cited as a particular problem for alcoholics and homeless people because it is cheap but strong. But traditional cider makers, some with decades of history in the craft, warned that they would be caught up in legislation that might not even have the desired effect. Arfur Daley, of the family-run Gwatkin Cider, in Herefordshire, said: “It won’t affect the larger cider makers. But the more artisanal cider makers it will affect. I’d like to see an exception if you’re using whole fruit. Larger cider makers use concentrate, but everything we make is from the apples.” Neil Worley, managing director of Worley’s Cider, in Somerset, said that while small producers could suffer, white cider firms could still sell cheap high-strength drink. “They will just reformulate to 6.9%,” he said. “At £3.50 a bottle the price would be 15.5p a unit and at 6.9% it’s 16.9p per unit, so the difference is negligible.” But the plans also drew criticism from larger white cider firms, such as Aston Manor Cider, whose 7.5% Frosty Jack’s brand costs £3.59 for a three-litre bottle in the shop Iceland.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

But traditional cider makers, some with decades of history in the craft, warned that they would be caught up in legislation that might not even have the desired effect. Arfur Daley, of the family-run Gwatkin Cider, in Herefordshire, said: “It won’t affect the larger cider makers. But the more artisanal cider makers it will affect. I’d like to see an exception if you’re using whole fruit. Larger cider makers use concentrate, but everything we make is from the apples.” Neil Worley, managing director of Worley’s Cider, in Somerset, said that while small producers could suffer, white cider firms could still sell cheap high-strength drink. “They will just reformulate to 6.9%,” he said. “At £3.50 a bottle the price would be 15.5p a unit and at 6.9% it’s 16.9p per unit, so the difference is negligible.” But the plans also drew criticism from larger white cider firms, such as Aston Manor Cider, whose 7.5% Frosty Jack’s brand costs £3.59 for a three-litre bottle in the shop Iceland.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Paragraphs and only paragraphs are separated with each other by two new lines as if it was '\\n\\n' in python. Paragraph 2 must start with word bother.",
    "response":"Traditional cider makers are facing potential unfair treatment with plans for a new tax on super-strength cider, while the rest of the drinks industry welcomes a budget freeze on alcohol duty. 'White cider', which is often cheaper and stronger, is the target of this new duty band. However, traditional cider producers argue that the legislation might disproportionately affect them due to their focus on using whole fruit, as opposed to the concentrate used by larger producers.\n\nBothering traditional cider makers is the concern that the tax might not even achieve its intended effect. They fear that the larger, more industrial cider makers will simply reformulate their products to just below the 6.9% threshold, potentially degrading the quality and flavors of their unique apple-brewed creations without a significant change in price. While some argue that small-scale producers might be hit harder, the impact on consumers could be minimal as secondary white cider brands still offer cheap, potent alternatives.\n\n\\n\\nDespite these criticisms, larger producers like Aston Manor Cider, whose Frosty Jack’s brand has an 7.5% alcohol content, remain primarily concerned about the overall regulatory environment challenging their ability to meet market demands without compromising on product quality.",

This incident happened at the beginning of the month, prompting a reflection on the balance between the urgency of their mission and the respect for nearby property.

One particular man was visibly concerned, and the crew understood that they needed to act promptly. They typically adopt a measured approach to parking to maintain an effective medical response. However, in cases of immediate patient need, such as the one they were facing, they aim to secure the quickest possible response by positioning themselves close to the scene. The parking location was such that it blocked the driveway of the property they were serving, which is a common challenge for emergency vehicle operators. The crew acknowledges the critical nature of their work, requiring them to navigate tight spaces quickly and safely. In retrospect, they were reminded of the importance of balance in how they manage parking to minimize the impact on the community while ensuring they can get to patients in the most efficient manner. The viral note and subsequent social media attention acted as a poignant reminder for medical professionals like them about the perception and reality of public parking challenges.

A few years ago, Texan Kevin Connelly found a burglar asleep in his guest room in Houston and called the police. In Florida, the Sarasota county sheriff’s office was called after a cleaning lady found a man sleeping on a bed next to a bagful of jewellery he had intended to steal. “The man was still sleeping when deputies arrived.

    "response":"<<Intersection of Redemption and Ruin>>\n\nThe passage introduces an intense scene with James Toney, a former boxer now sitting a foot away from the author, directly challenging the reasons behind his transition from fighting. This scene evokes memories of Toney's tumultuous past, especially his violent upbringing. As a child, his father's repeated abuse, culminating in a near fatal shooting of his mother, Sherry, left a profoundly negative impact. Despite the disaster that could have been his life, Sherry persevered, guiding Toney towards a constructive path by enrolling him in a boxing gym. This shift symbolizes turning a life trajectory of a 'disaster' into a path of discipline and self-restraint. However, the gravity of his past, including his involvement in the 'trash' and 'gun' culture surrounding him, serves as a stark reminder of the battles that shaped him as a 'fighter'. The dialogue and backstory paint a poignant picture of redemption and the formidable resilience of the human spirit, offering hope that every 'floor' in one's life story can be the platform for a new 'chapter'.",

But perhaps it’s more the fact that he doesn’t want to – or can’t – admit to himself that, while he toys with the idea of a girlfriend and tools around with his delinquent buddies, he is drawn, time and again, to gay hook-up websites in search of older men. The Brooklyn summer of Eliza Hittman’s superb second feature is an endless fairground ride of cheap highs and long, dragging, wasted moments. Escape comes in pill form, filched by Frankie from the stock of prescription medication intended to take the sharp edges off his dying father’s pain. Frankie and his boys bask like lizards, shirtless and heavy-lidded as they eye the girls on the beach. Hittman shares something of Claire Denis’s gift for finding vulnerability in a chiselled male body and a kind of bruised poetry in the tough-guy swagger of these teenage kids.

In a related development, the Old Vic theatre, where Spacey served as artistic director from 2003 to 2015, reported receiving 56 contacts with 20 individual allegations of inappropriate conduct against him from former staff and individuals, including claims of misconduct that allegedly took place against former staff members.\"",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n At this stage in her career, no one expects Björk’s latest record to sound much like her last one. And yet it’s hard to avoid heaving a thankful sigh when Arisen My Senses, the opening track of her ninth studio album, Utopia, crashes into life: birdsong giving way to bright splashes of electronics, beatific-sounding harp chords and cascading beats not unlike the oft-sampled rhythm track of Schoolly D’s old rap classic PSK, What Does It Mean? It sounds positively ecstatic, which comes as a relief. Utopia’s predecessor, 2015’s Vulnicura, was a remarkable record, a latterday entry into the canon of legendary break-up albums. It attained its place alongside Marvin Gaye’s Here, My Dear and Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks by setting its fathomless misery to atonal string arrangements and abstract electronics that, during its central track, kept vanishing into a single flatlining beep. It was raw, brave, challenging, unique and all the other adjectives heaped on it in reviews, but with the best will in the world, any album so harrowing that the appearance of gloom-laden vocalist Anohni constitutes a moment of light relief is going to be one that defies you to listen to it repeatedly. Utopia reanimates Vulnicura’s collaboration with Venezuela-born electronic auteur Arca, but is made of lighter material. Aside from his endlessly shifting soundscapes, distorted beats and penchant for sonic tapestries made from manipulated vocal samples, the album’s primary sound is woodwind, provided by an assembly of 12 female flautists from Reykjavik, which automatically lends it a far airier quality than the claustrophobic Vulnicura. It is, Björk says, her “Tinder album”, and its advance billing as a kind of Songs for Swinging Bachelorettes is borne out by its lyrics, which are obsessed both with technology and the vicissitudes of budding romance. “Is this excess texting blessing?” ponders Blissing Me, the saga of “two music nerds … sending each other MP3s”, before reverting to grief: “our physical union a fantasy, I just fell in love with a song”.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Hammond’s colleagues used the first of four days of scheduled debate about the budget to praise not just his high-profile announcements on housing, but also his commitment of £3bn to prepare for any Brexit eventuality. In his response to the budget, Corbyn – it is the leader of the opposition who traditionally speaks rather than the shadow chancellor – said Hammond had completely failed to tackle a national crisis of stagnation and falling wages. “The test of a budget is how it affects the reality of people’s lives all around this country,” the Labour leader said. “And I believe as the days go ahead, and this budget unravels, the reality will be – a lot of people will be no better off. And the misery that many are in will be continuing.” Largely eschewing direct focus on Hammond’s specific announcements in favour of a broader critique of the government’s wider economic approach, Corbyn castigated Hammond for again missing deficit reduction targets, and for a continued spending squeeze on schools and the police. Speaking about housing, Corbyn said rough sleeping had doubled since 2010, and that this Christmas 120,000 children would be living in temporary accommodation. “We need a large-scale publicly funded housebuilding programme, not this government’s accounting tricks and empty promises.”Summing up, he said: “We were promised a revolutionary budget.

I like to hedge my bets when I’m making my dinner choices, so I’m a fan of any dish where a little of everything – a note from every family of flavour – is in attendance. And nowhere is this more the case than with this Japanese noodle dish. There is something quite solitary about a bowl of ramen. Maybe it’s the inevitable slurping that comes with noodles and soup, which is why I often find myself eating it on my own, a calm meditative pleasure in the middle of a hectic day or when I’m in need of some bolstering warmth. Most people will know ramen as noodles served in a deeply flavoured meat broth, and while meat is not my thing, I get the appeal of that savoury, umami bowlful. Rich in oil, the broth hugs the noodles, making the whole dish deeply satisfying. Here I use almond milk to add a similar deep silkiness. This might sound a little strange if you are used to a clearer soup, but it works. If you are still sceptical, then replace the milk with more water or even stock.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n There are few foods that lure me in more than a bowl of ramen. I like to hedge my bets when I’m making my dinner choices, so I’m a fan of any dish where a little of everything – a note from every family of flavour – is in attendance. And nowhere is this more the case than with this Japanese noodle dish. There is something quite solitary about a bowl of ramen. Maybe it’s the inevitable slurping that comes with noodles and soup, which is why I often find myself eating it on my own, a calm meditative pleasure in the middle of a hectic day or when I’m in need of some bolstering warmth. Most people will know ramen as noodles served in a deeply flavoured meat broth, and while meat is not my thing, I get the appeal of that savoury, umami bowlful. Rich in oil, the broth hugs the noodles, making the whole dish deeply satisfying. Here I use almond milk to add a similar deep silkiness. This might sound a little strange if you are used to a clearer soup, but it works. If you are still sceptical, then replace the milk with more water or even stock.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The Simon Langton grammar school for boys in Canterbury, which caused controversy last year when it invited its former pupil Milo Yiannopoulos, the rightwing controversialist, to speak, sparked fresh concerns this week with a new debating forum that it said was designed to be “an antidote to the poison of political correctness”. Some parents and pupils backed the school. But now it has distanced itself from the term “unsafe space” after other pupils and parents voiced their alarm on social media. The local Labour MP whose sons attended the school but have now left also voiced her reservations. The scheme’s name is a reference to the phrase “safe space” – a zone in which a person or category of people can feel confident they will not be exposed to discrimination, criticism, harassment or any other emotional or physical harm. The head of school, Ken Moffat, said the phrase unsafe space was “a bit of a misnomer”. “The name is the Tong Centre for Creative Research, it is not called ‘the unsafe space’ and that’s not a phrase I am wedded to and expect to see wither over time.” In a letter to parents, Moffat dismissed concerns raised in media reports. “Our aim is quite simple: to continue with what we are already doing in allowing our young men and women to debate interesting ideas at the highest level possible with speakers from both within and without the school community,” he wrote. “Just because we use the term ‘freedom of speech’ does not mean we will indulge homophobic, xenophobic, racist or sexist beliefs.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n England are pencilled in to play Ireland in Dublin next autumn under the auspices of a new Six Nations tournament to increase the strength of northern hemisphere rugby league. The tournament is provisionally on the Rugby League International Federation’s calendar and would comprise the same participants as rugby union’s Six Nations in 2018. Of those six, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France and Italy were eliminated in the group stages of the current Rugby League World Cup, while England face Tonga in a semi-final on Saturday. Richard Egan, the chairman of Rugby League Ireland, told the Guardian: “The provisional RLIF fixtures at the minute show that there is a Six Nations next year. It’s unconfirmed at the minute, though, and that’s where I have issues in developing the sport here. “In other sports you can buy tickets years in advance but I can’t guarantee what fixtures I’ve got to sell next year.” It is unclear when the RLIF plan to announce the details officially, though the tournament should take place in October and November, following the conclusion of the domestic season. However, that clashes with England’s three-Test series against New Zealand next autumn, details of which the Rugby Football League confirmed on Tuesday. That lends weight to the suggestion that the England Knights concept – an emerging talent side similar to union’s England Saxons – may return to play in the tournament. Egan, however, would be keen to see the strongest England side possible travel to Ireland to play in Dublin. He said: “We’re down for a provisional fixture against England in the capital and a game against Italy here, but if it’s an England B team that doesn’t work for me.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n New nuclear power stations in the UK can no longer compete with windfarms on price, according to the boss of a German energy company’s green power arm. Hans Bunting, the chief operating officer of renewables at Innogy SE, part of the company that owns the UK energy supplier npower, said offshore windfarms had become mainstream and were destined to become even cheaper because of new, bigger turbines. Asked whether nuclear groups that want to build new reactors in the UK could compete with windfarms on cost, even when their intermittency was taken into account, Bunting replied: “Obviously they can’t.” His comments came after MPs criticised the £30bn cost to consumers for EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and said ministers should revisit the case for new nuclear before proceeding with more projects. Innogy recently secured a subsidy of £74.75 per megawatt hour of power to build a windfarm off the Lincolnshire coast, which is £17.75 cheaper than Hinkley and should be completed about three years earlier. “What we see now [with prices] is with today’s technology. It’s not about tomorrow’s technology, which is about [to come in] 2025, 2027, when Hinkley will most likely come to the grid ... and then it [windfarms] will be even cheaper.” While the company is planning to use the most powerful turbines in the world today for the Lincolnshire windfarm, Bunting said even bigger ones in development would drive costs down further. “A few years ago everyone thought 10MW [turbines] was the maximum, now we’re talking about 15[MW]. It seems the sky is the limit,” he said. “[It] means less turbines for the same capacity, less steel in the ground, less cables, even bigger rotors catching more wind, so it will become cheaper.” However, EDF argued that nuclear was also on a path to lower costs. “Early offshore wind projects started at around £150 per MW\/h and developers have shown they can offer lower prices by repeating projects with an established supply chain – the same is true for nuclear,” an EDF spokesman said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.
