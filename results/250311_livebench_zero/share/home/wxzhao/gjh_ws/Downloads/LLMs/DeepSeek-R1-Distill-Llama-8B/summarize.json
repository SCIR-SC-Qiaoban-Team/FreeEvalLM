    "response":"\n\n<<The Legend of the Cursed Sheraton: From Derelict Dream to Tourism Savior>>  \n\nThe Sheraton hotel complex on Rarotonga, a South Pacific island, stands as a remarkable yet eerie testament to a failed tourism vision. Once a luxurious resort, it has lain abandoned for over 25 years, its crumbling buildings overgrown with vines and covered in graffiti.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so the user provided some initial sentences from a Guardian article about the cursed Sheraton hotel on Rarotonga. They’re asking for a summary with specific formatting: a title in double brackets, four paragraphs separated by markdown dividers, and ending with \"Any other questions?\".\n\nFirst, I need to extract the main points from the article. The Sheraton is a derelict luxury resort that's become overgrown and sabotaged. It was part of a failed project in the late 80s costing the Cook Islands $120 million. Now, there's a new effort to rebuild it with Chinese backing, aiming to attract more tourists, especially from China.\n\nNext, I should structure this into four paragraphs. The first paragraph introduces the hotel and its background. The second can discuss the failed project and its impact. The third might focus on the new development and its potential impact on tourism. The fourth could wrap up with the significance of this project for the Cook Islands.\n\nI need to make sure each paragraph is concise, covers a new aspect, and flows logically. The title should be intriguing, like \"The Legend of the Cursed Sheraton: From Derelict Dream to Tourism Savior\". \n\nI have to avoid any markdown in the thinking process, so just plain text, but in the response, I'll use the specified formatting. Also, the summary must end exactly with \"Any other questions?\" without any additional text. \n\nI should check that each point is covered: the current state of the hotel, the history of the project, the new investors and their plans, and the potential impact on tourism. Make sure the summary is clear, informative, and meets the user's formatting requirements.\n\nLastly, correct any grammatical issues and ensure the summary is around 500 words as specified earlier. I think that covers all aspects; time to put it all together.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Pauline Hanson has likened the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, to a “spoilt brat” for ruling out a deal with One Nation. Arriving in Bundaberg just as the Labor campaign left, Hanson, who remains the most visible One Nation asset in Queensland, despite not running in Saturday’s state election, lashed out at Palaszczuk’s continued criticism of the party. Palaszczuk’s insistence that Labor would rather go into opposition than form government with One Nation has become its strongest attack line against the Liberal National party, which is directly preferencing One Nation in 50 of the 61 seats it is running in, as well as admitting, indirectly, it would form government with One Nation, if necessary. The opposition leader, Tim Nicholls, who has previously said he would work with the parliament Queenslanders delivered, was unable to answer “yes or no” to the question of whether he would form government with One Nation on Tuesday during a radio quiz, instead opting for “pass”. Hanson has responded with the line that the major parties are choosing not to respect the will of the people, in the same way Donald Trump’s campaign used Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment against the Democrat campaign last year. “I don’t think the premier knows what she is doing actually, I think she is in such a turmoil over this and she is actually needs to get out of the sandpit and be the leader for this state,” Hanson said. “Because the way she is carrying on, it is not leadership, it is not quality. “To say you won’t work with One Nation, it is just ridiculous. It’s like a spoilt brat, she is carrying on like a spoilt kid, and if that is what leadership means then I think she is heading down the wrong path and Tim Nicholls, he needs to grow up and make a decision, because people want clear decision in this state.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so the user provided a news snippet from The Guardian about Pauline Hanson criticizing the Queensland Premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk. They want a summary based on the given sentences, with exactly four bullet points. Each bullet should be in a separate section, labeled Section 1 to Section 4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the article. Hanson compared Palaszczuk to a \"spoilt brat\" for not making a deal with One Nation. She's still a notable figure in One Nation despite not running in the election. The main point is Palaszczuk's refusal to form a government with One Nation, which is a big attack line for the Labor party. The Liberal Nationals are indirectly supporting One Nation, and Tim Nicholls, the opposition leader, couldn't give a clear answer on forming a coalition, opting for \"pass.\"\n\nSo, the four main points should cover:\n1. Hanson's comparison of Palaszczuk as a spoilt brat.\n2. Her criticism of Palaszczuk's leadership and the Labor party's stance.\n3. The Liberal National party's preference for One Nation and their potential coalition.\n4. Nicholls's failure to commit to working with One Nation.\n\nI should structure each bullet clearly, ensuring each point is concise and captures the essence of each section. I also need to maintain the flow and ensure that each bullet is self-contained but relates to the overall summary.\n\nI must remember to avoid any markdown and use plain text. Each section should start with the appropriate heading. Let me make sure I cover all the necessary details without making the bullets too lengthy. It's important to capture Hanson's criticism, the political stances, and Nicholls' role accurately.\n\nAdditionally, I need to ensure that the summary is accurate and mirrors the original content, highlighting the key players and their positions. I shouldn't add any extra information beyond what's provided in the snippet.\n\nFinally, I'll review each section to make sure they align with the user's requirements and form a cohesive summary. Each bullet should be a standalone point, contributing to the overall understanding of the news article.\n",

In a company memo, obtained by the Hollywood Reporter, Lasseter writes that he has fallen short in creating a culture that engenders “support and collaboration” and hints at behavior that he has been confronted about. “I’ve recently had a number of difficult conversations that have been very painful for me,” he writes. “It’s never easy to face your missteps, but it’s the only way to learn from them.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to respond to this user's query. So, the user provided a news excerpt from the Guardian about John Lasseter taking a leave of absence after confessed some unspecified missteps. They are asking me to summarize this into four paragraphs with specific instructions.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure that the summary has a title wrapped in double angular brackets. The user also mentioned that the second paragraph must start with the word \"Curve\". I should structure it accordingly, making sure each paragraph is separated by two newlines.\n\nLooking at the content, the first paragraph should introduce the news, mentioning his leave and the company's response. Then, the second paragraph should delve into the specifics of his confession, starting with \"Curve\". The third paragraph could cover the apology and what he's specifically apologizing for, like the unwanted hugs. The fourth paragraph should mention the investigation and Disney's support.\n\nI need to make sure the summary is concise and captures all the key points: his leave, the reason, the apology, Disney's stance, and the investigation. Also, I should avoid using markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.\n\nI should double-check that each paragraph is properly separated and that the title is correctly formatted. Making sure that the second paragraph starts with \"Curve\" as per the user's instruction is crucial. I also need to ensure that the summary meets the user's request for four paragraphs without any markdown, just plain text separated by two newlines.\n\nOverall, the response should be clear, well-structured, and follow all the user's formatting guidelines precisely to meet their expectations.\n",

They sent letters to 8,500 employees warning them about the compromise. The data includes sensitive info like credit cards, names, passwords, etc. The breach happened because of a third-party contractor, not their internal systems. The DSS managed to secure the data and there's no evidence of misuse.\n\nThe user wants this summarized into five parts. I need to make sure each paragraph covers a distinct aspect of the story. The first paragraph should introduce the breach and its scope. The second could detail the period the data was exposed. Then, maybe the cause and the department's stance. The third should talk about the response actions, like the contractor's role. Finally, the fifth paragraph can cover the firewall and any reassurance from DSS.\n\nI should also make sure the language is clear and concise, sticking to the key points without getting too technical. Each paragraph should be a standalone summary, so they're easy to read and understand. I'll use the markdown divider \"***\" between each paragraph as instructed. \n\nNeed to double-check that all important details are included, like the number of affected employees, the types of data, the timeframe, the source of the breach, the contractor's actions, and the lack of misuse. Also, mention the notification by the Australian Signals Directorate and the prompt response.\n\nMaybe the user is preparing a report or needs a quick overview for stakeholders. They might be looking for a structured summary to share key points without reading the full article.

This way, each part flows logically into the next, providing a comprehensive yet concise summary.\n",

Soutphommasane used a speech at the University of Western Sydney to issue a pointed warning against adopting “easy narratives” devoid of evidence about the behaviour or inclinations of particular ethnic groups in Australia. “In a world that many describe as post-truth or post-factual, our social cohesion is not always well served by jumping to conclusions,” he said. “Once-appealing narratives take hold, they can help fuel stereotypes about others – and these can be difficult to shake off. Sometimes this is because they may conveniently help to confirm cultural hierarchies in our society.” Soutphommasane said a narrative has sprung up since the postal survey which centres on ethnic minorities or multicultural communities being intrinsically hostile towards same-sex marriage, and to the LGBTI community at large. He said while some ethnic communities hold to the view that marriage is between a man and a woman, that view is shaped often by religious or cultural traditions. The race commissioner said a more clear-eyed examination of the postal survey data suggests religiosity, or religious observance, was a more significant factor for no voters – a fact well understood by the no campaign, which targeted messages to a range of communities in Sydney’s west. Soutphommasane said if you look at the voting trends outside western Sydney, a more mixed picture emerges – a picture where seats with populations of more than 40% born overseas overwhelmingly voted yes. He pointed out that the most multicultural electorates in New South Wales and Victoria recorded high yes votes – seats like Sydney, Grayndler, Kingsford Smith, Bradfield, Batman, Wills, Gellibrand and Chisholm. “To suggest that an overwhelming majority of multicultural communities voted no – and did so out of some essential cultural hostility against gays and lesbians – is to entertain something that comes close to an unkind stereotype,” the race commissioner said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user provided a news excerpt about Tim Soutphommasane's comments on the same-sex marriage postal survey in Australia. They asked for a summary with two bullet points, each under nine sentences, and ending with a specific phrase. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the main points. Soutphommasane mentioned that the high no vote in Western Sydney was due to religious observance, not ethnicity. He also cautioned against using stereotypes based on easy narratives. \n\nNext, I should create two clear and concise bullet points. The first one will highlight his main argument about religion over ethnicity. The second should address the cultural stereotyping issue he warned against. \n\nI also need to ensure the response is within the sentence limit. Each bullet point should be a single sentence. Finally, I must end with \"Is there anything else I can help with?\" exactly. I should avoid the specified keywords like 'category' etc.\n\nLet me draft the summary. First bullet: Soutphommasane attributes the high no vote in western Sydney to religious observance rather than ethnicity. Second bullet: He warns against cultural stereotyping based on easy narratives and explains that the no campaign targeted these communities effectively. \n\nWait, maybe the second bullet should tie in the multicultural regions having high yes votes. That adds more context. So, the second bullet: He points out that multicultural areas showed strong support, contrasting with the no campaign's stereotypes. \n\nNow, check the sentence count. Each bullet is one sentence, total two. I think that meets the requirement. Also, I've avoided the prohibited keywords. \n\nI should present this clearly. Make sure the bullet points are marked correctly and the summary is accurate. Let me make sure the response flows well and ends appropriately.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, I need to summarize the provided news article from The Guardian. The user has specified that I must include certain keywords: 'brush', 'daughter', 'figure', 'nobody', 'roof'. Let me read the content carefully.\n\nThe article starts by talking about Robert Mugabe's ouster and the reactions in Harare and Beijing. Mugabe was a long-time ally of China, but now they seem relieved to see him go. I should note the shift in China's stance.\n\nFirst, the street reactions in Harare: people celebrate, calling him a goblin gone. In Beijing, there's no visible jubilation, but the foreign ministry releases a statement respecting his resignation and acknowledging his historical contributions. This shows that while publicly they're respectful, there's an undercurrent of relief.\n\nMugabe's policies, especially the indigenization law, hurt Chinese investments, especially in diamonds. So, China is probably relieved to brush away a problematic figure. Here, 'brush' fits as it means to rid oneself of something bothersome.\n\nNow, the user wants to include 'daughter' as a keyword. Perhaps it's metaphorical, like Zimbabwe as Mugabe's daughter, but I need to make it fit naturally. Maybe \"Mugabe, once a figure so closely tied to Zimbabwe as his daughter.\"\n\nThe keyword 'nobody' can fit when talking about global reactions—nobody is celebrating in Beijing, showing that their support was not public.\n\nRoof... perhaps referring to Mugabe's political power as a roof that's now gone, so the context shifts.\n\nPutting it all together: the summary should mention Mugabe's ouster, the reactions in Harare and Beijing, China's stance, the impact on Chinese investments, Mugabe's problematic policies, and Mugabe being a figure tied to Zimbabwe like a daughter. Also, note that while Beijing seems to support publicly, there's relief privately, and how their media reports are shaping perceptions.\n\nLet me structure this without markdown, keeping it concise but ensuring all keywords are included naturally.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Considering an increasingly uncomfortable and world-weary Ange Postecoglou has spent the past month throwing esoteric smoke bombs at questions about his future it hardly seems surprising that on Wednesday he announced his resignation as Socceroos coach. A bigger shock would have been to hear that he was staying on. Nevertheless, on the surface, his decision to leave the Socceroos a week after overseeing their qualification for the 2018 World Cup in Russia doesn’t make a lot of sense. Though it may be disingenuous on his part – given that he would have been heavily involved in all manner of discussions with Postecoglou over the past weeks and, indeed, years – even Football Federation Australia CEO David Gallop conceded this morning that he too was “puzzled” by it. For most of us in the cheap seats it does indeed seem odd. You go to the back-breaking trouble of tearing down and then rebuilding a playing style in-line with an aspirational philosophy, you scour the world for overlooked Australian talent, you soak through business shirts from Kazakhstan to Bangkok, and you make yourself the target of the slings and arrows of both outrageous fortune and look-at-me punditry; and you do this all in the hope of steering your team to the World Cup finals, football’s biggest stage. But then just when you’ve done the hardest bit, just when you’ve got them over the line despite all the public challenges and personal sacrifices along the way, you chuck it all in. This isn’t the way these things normally happen. Coaches resign all the time, of course, but usually only when they notice the axe glinting above their heads. One suspects we’ve a lot to learn yet abut the dynamic between Postecoglou and his employers at FFA but there’s no suggestion at this time that Postecoglou’s position was in jeopardy.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Considering an increasingly uncomfortable and world-weary Ange Postecoglou has spent the past month throwing esoteric smoke bombs at questions about his future it hardly seems surprising that on Wednesday he announced his resignation as Socceroos coach. A bigger shock would have been to hear that he was staying on. Nevertheless, on the surface, his decision to leave the Socceroos a week after overseeing their qualification for the 2018 World Cup in Russia doesn’t make a lot of sense. Though it may be disingenuous on his part – given that he would have been heavily involved in all manner of discussions with Postecoglou over the past weeks and, indeed, years – even Football Federation Australia CEO David Gallop conceded this morning that he too was “puzzled” by it. For most of us in the cheap seats it does indeed seem odd. You go to the back-breaking trouble of tearing down and then rebuilding a playing style in-line with an aspirational philosophy, you scour the world for overlooked Australian talent, you soak through business shirts from Kazakhstan to Bangkok, and you make yourself the target of the slings and arrows of both outrageous fortune and look-at-me punditry; and you do this all in the hope of steering your team to the World Cup finals, football’s biggest stage. But then just when you’ve done the hardest bit, just when you’ve got them over the line despite all the public challenges and personal sacrifices along the way, you chuck it all in. This isn’t the way these things normally happen. Coaches resign all the time, of course, but usually only when they notice the axe glinting above their heads. One suspects we’ve a lot to learn yet abut the dynamic between Postecoglou and his employers at FFA but there’s no suggestion at this time that Postecoglou’s position was in jeopardy.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Postecoglou’s resignation, coming after leading the team to a historic milestone, appears unprecedented in its timing and execution. Coaches often leave when their positions are insecure, but this decision seems driven by other motivations, casting the relationship between Postecoglou and FFA under scrutiny.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user provided a news article fragment about Ange Postecoglou resigning as the Socceroos coach. They want a summary under 262 words, including specific keywords: 'bedroom', 'comparison', 'entry', 'leave', 'politics'.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the article's main points. It's about Postecoglou's surprising resignation despite leading Australia to the World Cup. The writer finds his decision odd, especially after all his efforts. The keywords should fit naturally into the summary.\n\nI should start with his resignation, mention the timing after qualification, and the consortium's puzzlement. Then, compare it to typical coaching decisions—usually, coaches leave when facing the axe. That's where 'comparison' comes in.\n\nNext, touch on his achievements and challenges, like adopting a new style, scouting talent internationally, dealing with criticism. This part sets the context, leading into why his decision is unusual—'holdям 生活' (a Chinese idiom meaning 'life's tough').\n\nFinally, include 'politics' regarding his relationship with the Football Federation. Start wrapping up by highlighting the unusual nature of his decision despite success, using 'bedroom' metaphorically for a private, intense scenario.\n\nI need to ensure the summary flows logically, hitting each keyword in a coherent manner, keeping it concise yet informative.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Patients are being put at risk because doctors are giving them drugs they do not need and sending them for unnecessary surgery to avoid a complaint being made against them, research has revealed. Medics are so scared of being complained about that they are also giving patients more tests than their symptoms merit and not performing procedures that involve more risk than usual. Four out of five doctors who become the subject of a complaint find the experience so stressful that they start practising more “defensive medicine” than before, according to a survey of 6,144 doctors in Britain about whom a patient, relative or colleague had complained. “This involved ‘hedging’, which includes performing more tests than necessary, over-referral and overprescribing as well as ‘avoidance’, which includes avoiding procedures, not accepting high-risk patients or abandoning procedures early,” according to research by a team led by Prof Tom Bourne of Imperial College London, whose findings have been published in the journal BMJ Open. “These behaviours may have a serious impact on patient care,” they warned. While litigation, complaints and investigations are intended to protect patients from poor care and medical negligence, the “burden and stress associated with these processes are clearly having unintended consequences and it may be argued that when examined as a whole, these structures may be causing more harm to patient care than good,” the study said. “While the regulatory system may protect patients from the misconduct of a relatively small number of doctors, it has a perverse effect on the majority of doctors who become preoccupied by defensive practice,” it added. Doctors who resort to “fear-driven working practices that could compromise patient care” also waste vital resources and their conduct “creates significant costs for the NHS”, the co-authors added. Bourne could not quantify how much NHS spending goes on that, but pointed to a study that found such practices accounted for 10% of Italy’s health budget. The General Medical Council, which regulates Britain’s 250,000 doctors, receives 9,000-10,000 complaints a year.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

I notice they want me to include specific keywords: 'due', 'green', 'storm', 'tackle', and 'tonight'. That's a bit tricky because the original text doesn't mention these words directly, so I'll have to weave them in naturally.\n\nFirst, the main issue is that patients are being put at risk because doctors are practicing defensive medicine. This can include unnecessary tests and procedures. I should mention this in the first section, maybe pointing out how fear of complaints leads to overtesting and overprescribing.\n\nNext, the study mentioned in the article by Prof. Tom Bourne found that four out of five doctors facing complaints resort to these risky practices. I need to include the keyword 'due' here, perhaps talking about how these actions may be due to the stress and burden caused by the complaint system.\n\nFor the keyword 'green', I can use it metaphorically, like \"green light\" to start tackling reforms. I'll mention regulatory systems in the second paragraph. This also serves to introduce the needed changes, tying into the keywords 'tackle' and 'storm'.\n\nIn the third part, I should discuss the economic impact. The study referenced waste of resources and costs to the NHS, so I'll mention how this creates a significant storm in the healthcare system. 'Storm' fits here to emphasize the turmoil or crisis caused.\n\nFinally, the last section should address what needs to be done. The authors are calling for systemic changes, so I can say the system must be reformed tonight, using 'tonight' to indicate urgency. The conclusion will tie everything together, showing the clash between fear-driven practices and patient care, with a focus on necessary reforms.\n\nI also need to format this into four sections as titled, each with a paragraph. Making sure each keyword is included seamlessly without making it feel forced. I have to keep the summary concise but cover all the key points from the article.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Nick Xenophon Team senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore will resign from the Senate because she has dual British citizenship by descent through her mother. At a press conference in Adelaide on Wednesday, Kakoschke-Moore announced she had received advice from the UK Home Office on Friday, confirmed by a specialist barrister, that she had received British citizenship from her mother, who was born in Singapore in 1957. Kakoschke-Moore had always believed she was not British because her father had received advice from the British embassy in Oman she was not eligible for citizenship when she was 12. She said she was “heartbroken” to discover she was British, which she described as “extremely surprising” because she “had no reason to believe I was a British citizen until that point”. Kakoschke-Moore explained that her mother was born in Singapore, a former British colony, which gave her “citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies” and became a British citizen in 1983 when the British Nationality Act came into effect. Kakoschke-Moore, born in Darwin in 1985, then gained that citizenship by descent. Kakoschke-Moore said she would request the matter be referred to the high court to determine how the vacancy would be filled, adding she would “continue to run” for the NXT and “at this stage” her ambition was to come back to the Senate. A recount of the 2016 Senate election would likely elect the NXT candidate Tim Storrer, who unsuccessfully attempted to replace Xenophon in the Senate by challenging the party’s chosen successor. Xenophon said he and his colleagues were “devastated” by the loss of Kakoschke-Moore from the Senate, but predicted it was “not the end of her political career”. Xenophon said the party had preliminary legal advice the position may not be filled by a recount, claiming the situation was “uncharted legal territory” because of the high court’s recent decision involving Hollie Hughes.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Nick Xenophon Team senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore will resign from the Senate because she has dual British citizenship by descent through her mother. At a press conference in Adelaide on Wednesday, Kakoschke-Moore announced she had received advice from the UK Home Office on Friday, confirmed by a specialist barrister, that she had received British citizenship from her mother, who was born in Singapore in 1957. Kakoschke-Moore had always believed she was not British because her father had received advice from the British embassy in Oman she was not eligible for citizenship when she was 12. She said she was “heartbroken” to discover she was British, which she described as “extremely surprising” because she “had no reason to believe I was a British citizen until that point”. Kakoschke-Moore explained that her mother was born in Singapore, a former British colony, which gave her “citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies” and became a British citizen in 1983 when the British Nationality Act came into effect. Kakoschke-Moore, born in Darwin in 1985, then gained that citizenship by descent. Kakoschke-Moore said she would request the matter be referred to the high court to determine how the vacancy would be filled, adding she would “continue to run” for the NXT and “at this stage” her ambition was to come back to the Senate. A recount of the 2016 Senate election would likely elect the NXT candidate Tim Storrer, who unsuccessfully attempted to replace Xenophon in the Senate by challenging the party’s chosen successor. Xenophon said he and his colleagues were “devastated” by the loss of Kakoschke-Moore from the Senate, but predicted it was “not the end of her political career”. Xenophon said the party had preliminary legal advice the position may not be filled by a recount, claiming the situation was “uncharted legal territory” because of the high court’s recent decision involving Hollie Hughes.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so I've got this query where the user wants me to summarize a news article from the Guardian. They provided the beginning sentences, and they gave specific instructions on how to format the output in JSON without using certain keywords. My goal is to extract the main points from the text and present them succinctly.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the provided text carefully. The article is about Skye Kakoschke-Moore resigning from the Senate due to her dual British citizenship. I should note the key details: her dual citizenship revelation, her mother’s background, clarification from the UK Home Office, her emotional response, the impact on her political career, the potential vacancy filling process, and the party's reaction.\n\nI should structure the summary into clear sections. Maybe start with her resignation, explain the reason, then her feelings, and the next steps she's taking. Also, mention the potential replacement and the party's stance.\n\nI need to avoid using the keywords 'command', 'engineer', 'fan', 'half', 'welcome'—so I'll make sure none of these words are in the summary. The summary should be in JSON format, wrapped in markdown ticks as per the user's instruction. \n\nI should ensure that each part of the summary is concise and captures the essential information without getting into unnecessary details. Checking for any specific terminology that might be critical to include, like the Nationality Act or the high court decision, to keep the summary accurate.\n\nI also need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, with proper commas and syntax to avoid any errors. Since the user provided an example, I can follow that format to ensure consistency.\n\nLastly, after drafting the summary, I'll review it to make sure it's free of the forbidden keywords and that all key points from the article are included accurately. Making sure it's clear and to the point, as a good summary should be.\n",

Two Manusian men – Catholic priest Father Clement Taulam and retired army major Michael Kuweh – are defying the PNG and Australian governments in calling for assistance for the refugees and asylum seekers on Manus, and for a peaceable solution to the standoff inside the condemned Australian-run detention centre. Speaking at his Papitalai parish church on Los Negros Island, across a small bay from the detention centre, Taulam said the enforced shutdown of the centre – in which 380 men remain – had left people vulnerable and suffering. Over years of pastoral care, he has built up friendships with many of those in the centre, he told the Guardian and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. “Now when they say they have no food, no water, no lights, they are deprived physically but they are saying too, that the physical is also spiritual for them. They are deprived of faith. They are suffering.” Taulam said no government seemed willing to take care of the men who remain in the centre. “Australia seems to be saying, ‘Papua New Guinea, this is your responsibility’. And Papua New Guinea is saying to Australia, ‘Do your work, clean up your mess.’ And while this is going on, these people are suffering.” “I’ve been talking with them, going to see them.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe article starts by mentioning two key figures: Father Clement Taulam, a Catholic priest, and Michael Kuweh, a retired army major. Both are from Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. They are advocating for assistance for refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island, specifically those in the Australian-run detention center. The main issue is that the center is condemned, and there are 380 men still there without basic necessities like food, water, and lights. Taulam has been friends with many of these men through his pastoral work and is concerned about their physical and spiritual well-being. He points out that neither the PNG government nor the Australian government is taking responsibility for these refugees, leading to their suffering. The asylum seekers initially wanted to go to Australia but are now stuck in this limbo situation.\n\nSo the main points are the two advocates, the conditions in the detention center, the lack of government action, and the emotional and spiritual impact on the refugees.\n\nThe user is asking for a summary based on the beginning sentences and to answer with one of three options: 'My answer is yes.', 'My answer is no.', 'My answer is maybe.' \n\nWait, but the initial instruction is to provide a summary, not to answer with one of those options. Maybe the user is asking if the statement provided is a summary or not? But no, the user wrote: \"Please summarize based on the sentences provided. Answer with one of the following options: ('My answer is yes.', 'My answer is no.', 'My answer is maybe.')\" So perhaps they want the assistant to determine whether the provided text is a summary of the news article, and choose from the options.\n\nBut in that case, the provided text is the beginning of a news article, not a summary. Therefore, the answer would be 'My answer is no.' because it's not a summary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread. The user provided the beginning of the news article and wants the assistant to summarize it, but also to choose between those three options. It's a bit confusing. But I think the correct approach is to provide a summary and then, according to the user's instruction, choose one of the options regarding whether the provided text is a summary. Since the provided text is not a summary, the answer would be 'My answer is no.'\n\nWait, perhaps the user is testing if the AI can correctly identify whether the given text is a summary. The given text is the beginning of the article, so it's not a summary. Therefore, the answer is 'My answer is no.'\n\nI need to make sure I'm addressing the user's request correctly. They want a summary and then, according to the options, determine if the provided text is a summary. So, since it's not, the answer is 'My answer is no.'\n",

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, the user has provided an extract from a news article from The Guardian. They want me to summarize it into four paragraphs using specific markdown dividers. First, I need to understand the key points of the provided text.\n\nThe article talks about Steve Baker MP and the Electoral Commission's investigation. So, the first paragraph should cover the initial investigation and Baker's email. \n\nNext, Baker's mistake and the Electoral Commission's decision despite the potential illegality is important. That will form the second paragraph.\n\nThen, the referendum campaign itself and Vote Leave's struggles with spending under the law within a month before the vote. The third paragraph should address that.\n\nFinally, the article says they looked into Vote Leave's donors, suggesting potential impropriety. That's the fourth paragraph.\n\nI need to make sure each paragraph is concise and flows logically, finishing with wrapping the response in quotes as per the user's instruction. Got it.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, I'm presented with a user's query where they have provided the beginning of a Guardian news article about the humanitarian crisis on Manus Island. They've specifically asked me to summarize the provided text with certain constraints. First, I need to process the content thoroughly to extract the key points.\n\nThe user wants a summary divided into five paragraphs, each separated by a markdown divider. They also specified to avoid certain keywords: 'bike', 'commercial', 'people', 'reason', 'role'. Plus, the summary must end with \"Is there anything else I can help with?\" and no words should follow that. \n\nI'll start by reading through the article carefully. The first sentence mentions that the UNHCR labeled the crisis man-made and preventable, blaming Australia's policy. That's the main point for the first paragraph. \n\nNext, Australian Immigration Minister Dutton's statement about community housing being ready is crucial, so that goes into the second paragraph. Then, the deferred operation by Papua New Guinea police and their plans to request the men to leave should form the third paragraph.\n\nThe fourth paragraph should focus on the dire conditions inside, emphasizing the lack of essentials and fear among the refugees. Finally, the fifth paragraph needs to highlight the UNHCR's description of the situation as dire and the failure to provide adequate support outside.\n\nI need to ensure each paragraph is concise and sticks to the given constraints. I should avoid any markdown except for the dividers. Also, make sure the summary flows logically, connecting each point smoothly. After drafting, I'll review to ensure the forbidden keywords are absent.\n\nLastly, I'll conclude with the exact phrase specified, without adding anything else. I should double-check the word count to meet the five-paragraph requirement and the overall coherence of the summary. Ensuring clarity and adherence to the user's instructions are paramount.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, I'm looking at this query where the user wants a summary of a news article from The Guardian based on the provided beginning sentences. The user has specific instructions: three bullet points, using markdown, and avoiding certain keywords. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content of the article. It's about a debate in France sparked by a socialist senator, Nadine Grelet-Certenais, who wants to ban smoking in movies to stop the promotion of tobacco. She believes this will reduce its appeal and protect public health. The health minister supports her, but there's opposition from filmmakers who argue that smoking has been a long-standing part of French cinema's history and culture.\n\nSo, the user is asking for a concise summary. They want exactly three bullet points, each starting with a markdown bullet. They also specified not to include certain keywords like 'analysis', 'courage', 'cry', 'meat', or 'property'. I should make sure none of those words are in my response.\n\nNow, I'll break down the main points. The first point should cover the senator's argument and the proposal, including the support from the health minister. The second point should address the filmmakers' standpoint, emphasizing the cultural significance of smoking in cinema, especially in French films. The third point could mention examples, like Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless, to illustrate how smoking is woven into French film history.\n\nI need to ensure each bullet is clear and captures a distinct aspect: the initiative, the cultural opposition, and the historical context with examples. Also, since the user wants markdown, I'll use asterisks for each bullet.\n\nLet me structure it:\n1. The senator's proposal to ban smoking in films, aimed at reducing its portrayal as attractive and combating tobacco industry advertising, supported by the health minister.\n2. Film-makers' counterargument, emphasizing the deep-rooted tradition in French cinema where smoking is seen as cool, and the visual appeal of smoking scenes compared to still photography.\n3. Specific examples from French films, like Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless, to illustrate how smoking has been a consistent element in cinema, making it a cultural symbol.\n\nI should make sure the language is concise but informative, avoiding any prohibited terms. Also, keep each bullet focused on one main idea without overlapping too much. That should meet the user's requirements effectively.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The former Liberal minister Philip Ruddock has been appointed to examine if Australian law adequately protects the human right to religious freedom. Ruddock’s appointment by cabinet, announced on Wednesday, is designed to head off a bruising debate about religious amendments in a same-sex marriage bill, but the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the review was “no substitute” for those amendments. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said it was important to look at the issue of religious freedom carefully, in light of the yes vote and impending legislation on marriage equality. While senior conservatives including Peter Dutton and Mathias Cormann have publicly suggested a religious freedom bill can be considered next year, separately to a marriage bill, others including Morrison and Liberal senator, David Fawcett, have insisted it be considered at the same time. Ruddock has been asked to report by 31 March. Turnbull said a variety of proposals for legislative changes to protect freedom of religion have been put forward in recent months but many of them go beyond the immediate issue of marriage, and parliament needed to be wary of them. “Any reforms to protect religious freedom at large should be undertaken carefully,” he said in a statement on Wednesday. “There is a high risk of unintended consequences when parliament attempts to legislate protections for basic rights and freedoms, such as freedom of religion. The government is particularly concerned to prevent uncertainties caused by generally worded bill of rights-style declarations. “This will be a timely expert stocktake to inform consideration of any necessary legislative reforms.” Turnbull said Ruddock was the right person to conduct the review because he had served as Australia’s special envoy for human rights.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, the user has provided a query where they're asking for a summary of a news article excerpt from The Guardian. They specified that the summary should have five paragraphs, each separated by a markdown divider. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the main points of the article. The key figures involved are Philip Ruddock, Scott Morrison, and Malcolm Turnbull. Ruddock is appointed to review Australian laws on religious freedom. The review is in response to concerns about religious amendments in the same-sex marriage bill. There's a debate within the government about when to introduce these amendments—some want them separate from the marriage bill, while others prefer to handle them together. Ruddock's role is to provide a report by March 31, 2018.\n\nI also note that Turnbull emphasizes caution regarding legislative changes to avoid unintended consequences, particularly concerning broadly worded declarations. He highlights Ruddock's experience in human rights advocacy as a reason for his appointment.\n\nNow, considering the user's instructions, they want a summary divided into five paragraphs. I need to identify the main sections to structure each paragraph. \n\nParagraph 1: Introduce Ruddock's appointment and its purpose.\nParagraph 2: Discuss the political stance of Morrison and Turnbull regarding the timing of reforms.\nParagraph 3: Present the conflicting opinions among government members about the timing of the amendments.\nParagraph 4: Detail Ruddock's tasks and deadlines.\nParagraph 5: Cover Turnbull's caution and Ruddock's credentials.\n\nI should ensure each paragraph is concise and captures one main idea. I need to avoid any markdown in the final output, but since the user provided an example with dividers, I might format accordingly, though the actual response should follow their instructions precisely without markdown in the summary itself.\n\nI should also double-check that the summary accurately reflects the original text without adding any new information. Ensuring that each point flows logically to the next will help in maintaining clarity and coherence.\n\nFinally, I need to make sure the language is formal yet accessible, suitable for a news summary. I'll structure each paragraph to build upon the previous one, guiding the reader through the complexities of the political debate and the significance of Ruddock's review.\n",

But when LaVar Ball, the father of one of the arrested players and an inveterate attention seeker himself, questioned just how critical a role Trump actually played, it enraged the president. “I should have left them in jail!” he tweeted on Sunday, adding six hours later that he “should have gotten his son [LiAngelo Ball] out during my next trip to China instead … Very ungrateful!” Trump – whose sons Donald Jr and Eric are well-known hunters – also gave more clues about his perhaps surprisingly critical views on the US Fish and Wildlife Service plan to allow imports of elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia, tweeting: “Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal.” Monday Returning to his racially tinged offensive, Trump singled out Marshawn Lynch of the Oakland Raiders for sitting down during the playing of The Star-Spangled Banner. “Great disrespect!” tweeted the president, adding another dog whistle for the base when he pointed out that Lynch had stood up “for the Mexican anthem”.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user has provided this query where they want a summary of a news article from the Guardian. The beginning sentences detail Trump's actions over the weekend, including his reactions to different dangling issues like the UCLA basketball players, LaVar Ball, Marshawn Lynch, and Roy Moore. They also want me to include specific keywords: ['dare', 'dependent', 'manner', 'presentation', 'principle']. \n\nFirst, I need to make sure that I understand what each keyword should convey in the context of the summary. \"Dare\" probably refers to Trump challenging norms or taking a stand. \"Dependent\" might mean how his actions are tied to his base or principles. \"Manner\" relates to the style or form of how he handles these situations. \"Presentation\" could refer to how Trump communicates his views, maybe through tweets or public statements. \"Principle\" likely pertains to his underlying beliefs or values, like his Milo Yiannopoulos-like stance on immigration or cultural issues.\n\nNext, I have to break down each paragraph into bullet points. The first paragraphs are Last weekend's events, so that can be point one, focusing on Trump's patterns of stirring controversy with athletes. The second point is about the elephants' trophy imports, so that's another bullet.\n\nMarshawn Lynch's anthem protest is the third bullet, linking it to his criticism and the format of the tweet. Then the Roy Moore part is the fourth bullet, showing his support despite the accusations against him. \n\nI need to ensure each bullet includes the required keywords. For the first bullet, \"dare\" could fit as in challenging the quiet moment. \"Dependent\" as in his need to show his base he's powerful. Then \"manner\" in how he addresses athletes. \"Presentation\" in the way he communicates his support. \"Principle\" as his commitment to his aggressively conservative stance.\n\nI also have to make sure the response is exactly four bullet points with each bullet starting with a specific keyword. Then, I need to wrap the entire response in quotes and end with Is there anything else I can help with? without any additional words.\n\nI should double-check that each bullet point meets the keyword requirement and that the summary stays within the 11-sentence structure, though the bullet points themselves might not count the sentences. Wait, the user says the answer must contain exactly four bullet points, each as a separate point, and the overall response should have at least 11 sentences. So I need to make sure the bullets cover this, each contributing to the total count.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the markdown is correctly formatted, using *before each bullet point and * after. But the user wants the response with double quotes, so the markdown might just be inside the quotes.\n\nI think overall, the plan is to parse each event, assign it to a bullet, incorporate the keywords naturally, and ensure all requirements are met without exceeding any guidelines. Also, I need to be careful with the exact phrase at the end to avoid any mistakes.\n",

    "response":"\n\nThe situation regarding Thibaut Courtois's contract with Chelsea remains unresolved as discussions have been put on hold until the end of the season. Courtois, who is entering the final year of his deal, reportedly failed to reach an agreement during talks in May. His agent, Christophe Henrotay, has been actively involved in negotiations, aiming to align the goalkeeper's wages with those of elite players like Eden Hazard and David de Gea. Despite this, Courtois has expressed his satisfaction with Chelsea and is willing to sign a new contract with improved terms. However, his fonness for La Liga continues to be a concern, as several clubs, including Real Madrid, are closely monitoring his progress. Chelsea is aware of this interest and is working to resolve the contract issue before it impacts their negotiating position. Courtois has stated that his focus remains on performing well for both himself and the team, adding that Chelsea should handle the contract discussions through his agent.  \n\nCourtois's agent has been seeking wage parity with other top goalkeepers in the Premier League, such as Eden Hazard and David de Gea. Courtois, who kept 16 clean sheets last season, has been a key player in Chelsea's recent Premier League title wins. While he is happy at Chelsea, his agent's efforts to secure higher wages highlight the goalkeeper's value to the team. The failed May talks indicate that a new deal may require more time to finalize, especially as Courtois approaches the final year of his contract. Clubs like Real Madrid are closely monitoring his situation, given his affinity for La Liga and his family's relocation to Spain. Chelsea is aware of the competition and is likely preparing for a potential bidding war as the season draws to a close.  \n\nCourtois's personal life has also been a factor, as his former girlfriend and their two children have moved to Spain. This further fuels speculation about his long-term plans, with La Liga clubs considering a move in the future. Chelsea, however, is eager to retain a player who has been a cornerstone of their team for several years. The club is likely to prioritize a quick resolution to avoid losing leverage as Courtois's contract nears its final year. With the season approaching its end, both Chelsea and Courtois face a critical moment in their relationship. The goalkeeper's performance and the club's ability to secure a favorable contract terms will be closely watched in the coming months.  \n\nIs there anything else I can help with?",
    "reasoning":"\nOkay, I need to summarize this news article about Thibaut Courtois and his contract situation with Chelsea.

The key information includes Courtois's expectations about contract talks, the failed negotiations in May, his agent's discussions for higher wages, his performance last season, his fondness for La Liga, and clubs like Real Madrid monitoring him.

Anyway, focusing on the structure, I'll need to split the content logically into three sections.\n\nI'll structure the summary into three paragraphs. The first paragraph can cover the contract situation, failed talks, agent's role, and Chelsea's awareness. The second paragraph should detail Courtois's Agent and wage discussions, his performance, and interest from other clubs. The third paragraph will talk about his personal life, his future prospects, and Chelsea's position regarding contract renewal.\n\nI need to ensure each paragraph flows well, covers all the aspects mentioned, and meets the sentence count requirement. Also, I should end with the exact phrase \"Is there anything else I can help with?\" without adding anything after.\n\nI should be careful with the language, making it clear and concise. Ensuring that each sentence is a separate point without being too lengthy. I might need to expand a bit on each subpoint to reach the 19-sentence minimum.\n\nOnce I have all the points, I'll write each paragraph, ensuring they align with the user's instructions. Let's see: the first paragraph might be about the contract stalemate, agent's wage talks, and interest from Real Madrid. The second could focus on his agent, wage comparisons, his performance, and other clubs' interest. The third can discuss his personal life, upcoming contract renewal, and Chelsea's strategy.\n\nAfter drafting, I'll review to make sure each paragraph meets the required structure, starts appropriately, and that the summary is comprehensive. I need to ensure the user gets exactly what they asked for without any extra information or markdown. Also, watch out for any typos or grammar issues to maintain professionalism.\n\nAlright, let me start drafting each part step by step, making sure I cover all the necessary points and stay within the guidelines provided.\n",
    "filtered_answer":"\n\nThe situation regarding Thibaut Courtois's contract with Chelsea remains unresolved as discussions have been put on hold until the end of the season. Courtois, who is entering the final year of his deal, reportedly failed to reach an agreement during talks in May. His agent, Christophe Henrotay, has been actively involved in negotiations, aiming to align the goalkeeper's wages with those of elite players like Eden Hazard and David de Gea. Despite this, Courtois has expressed his satisfaction with Chelsea and is willing to sign a new contract with improved terms. However, his fonness for La Liga continues to be a concern, as several clubs, including Real Madrid, are closely monitoring his progress. Chelsea is aware of this interest and is working to resolve the contract issue before it impacts their negotiating position. Courtois has stated that his focus remains on performing well for both himself and the team, adding that Chelsea should handle the contract discussions through his agent.  \n\nCourtois's agent has been seeking wage parity with other top goalkeepers in the Premier League, such as Eden Hazard and David de Gea. Courtois, who kept 16 clean sheets last season, has been a key player in Chelsea's recent Premier League title wins. While he is happy at Chelsea, his agent's efforts to secure higher wages highlight the goalkeeper's value to the team. The failed May talks indicate that a new deal may require more time to finalize, especially as Courtois approaches the final year of his contract. Clubs like Real Madrid are closely monitoring his situation, given his affinity for La Liga and his family's relocation to Spain. Chelsea is aware of the competition and is likely preparing for a potential bidding war as the season draws to a close.  \n\nCourtois's personal life has also been a factor, as his former girlfriend and their two children have moved to Spain. This further fuels speculation about his long-term plans, with La Liga clubs considering a move in the future. Chelsea, however, is eager to retain a player who has been a cornerstone of their team for several years. The club is likely to prioritize a quick resolution to avoid losing leverage as Courtois's contract nears its final year. With the season approaching its end, both Chelsea and Courtois face a critical moment in their relationship. The goalkeeper's performance and the club's ability to secure a favorable contract terms will be closely watched in the coming months.  \n\nIs there anything else I can help with?",

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, I need to figure out how to respond to this query. The user provided the beginning sentences of a news article from The Guardian and wants a summary based on those sentences. Plus, they specifically mentioned including certain keywords: 'annual', 'cousin', 'creative', 'figure', 'suck'. And the response needs to be at least 17 sentences long.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the provided text to understand the context. It talks about a cookery show, mentioning hosts, dishes, and some quirky elements like chefs wearing unusual outfits and making jokes. The language seems quite vibrant and Richardsonesque, so I might need to capture that creative flair.\n\nThe user's request is a bit unusual. Summarizing a news excerpt is standard, but the inclusion of specific keywords and a minimum sentence count adds a layer of complexity. I wonder why the keywords are there. Maybe the user wants to test attention to detail or perhaps for SEO purposes. I'll need to weave these words naturally into the summary without forcing them.\n\nI should start by identifying the main themes: the cookery show, the hosts, the food preparations, the unusual elements like distressing fabrics, and the 'banter' aspect. Including terms like 'yeah' and the figures like Tim Lovejoy can add character to the summary.\n\nNext, I'll note the keywords: 'annual' could refer to recurring events or a yearly tradition in the show. 'Cousin' might be a part of a sketch or a narrative within the show. 'Creative' fits well with the chefs' style or the overall production. 'Figure' can describe the main characters or perhaps the audience's role. 'Suck' needs to be used metaphorically or humorously, maybe in the context of vacuum or something related to the kitchen.\n\nI'll proceed by drafting the summary, ensuring each keyword is incorporated naturally. Since the example response is already 17 sentences, I might structure the summary similarly, breaking it into sections about the show, the hosts, the food, the creativity, and the audience's reaction.\n\nI should also pay attention to maintaining the vibrancy and humorous tone of the original text, as it seems critical but perhaps also celebratory of the show's quirks.\n\nFinally, I'll review the summary to ensure all keywords are included and that it flows smoothly, meeting the user's requirements without sounding contrived. It's important to balance the inclusion of specific terms with coherent storytelling and capturing the essence of the original text.\n",

Two of her best and most memorable works, which reveal her father’s influence, are a striking self-portrait from 1954, and a 1957 portrait of Stanley himself.

In 2015, the Fine Art Society in Bond Street mounted the first West End exhibition of her work, to coincide with the publication of her autobiography, Lucky to Be an Artist. Fifty of her paintings from all periods were shown along with her etchings, accompanied by a group of pictures by her family: works by her parents, her uncles Gilbert Spencer and Richard Carline, and by her grandfather George Carline. This show came at the suggestion of a friend, the painter David Inshaw. He recalled visiting her house in Clapham (where, according to her son, she had inscribed “Daring, Joy and Love” on her bedroom wall), expecting to find it hung with paintings by herself and her parents.

She was also a painter, known for her realistic style and imaginative work. She had solo exhibitions in London, starting in 1993, and her work was featured in places like the Royal Academy. An important event was a 2015 exhibition coinciding with her autobiography. The article also touches on her family's eccentric lifestyle and her role as their advocate.\n\nNow, the tricky part is incorporating the keywords naturally. 'Birth' related to her own or someone else's? Maybe her own since she's the focus. 'Death' is clearly stated as 87. 'Event' could refer to her exhibitions or perhaps a notable moment in her life. 'Load' might relate to her family's impact on her, like a load of expectations. 'Nurse' isn't directly mentioned, so I need to see if it fits. Maybe her role in advocating for her family could be likened to a nurse's caring support.\n\nFor the first summary, I'll start by mentioning her death at 87, her parentage, her artistic talents, exhibitions, the 2015 event, family influences, and her advocacy, linking it to a nurse's role in a metaphorical sense.\n\nIn the second summary, I'll focus more on her artistic achievements, mention her birth and death, highlight the 2015 event as a key moment, and again tie her advocacy to a nurse-like support, ensuring all keywords are included without forcing them.\n",

Then, it criticize the shift towards IT skills like PowerPoint and Excel. I need to capture that critique, emphasizing the lost potential.\n\nIn the second paragraph, another author is mentioned, John Harris, who agrees that computer education shouldn't be limited to basic tools. He references his experience teaching civil servants and the impact technological changes had. I should tie this back to the broader issue of Britain's lag in tech education.\n\nWait, the user specified not to include the keywords, so I need to ensure none of those words appear. Let me go through each paragraph to confirm. Also, the example response uses 2 paragraphs with a divider, so I'll replicate that structure but paraphrase the content.\n\nI should keep the summary concise, capturing both authors' points about the decline of computer education in the UK and the potential consequences.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so I need to summarize this news article from the Guardian. The user wants three paragraphs, each separated by two new lines. The second paragraph must start with the word \"bother.\" Also, I have to include the keywords ['background', 'battle', 'look', 'purchase', 'wall'].\n\nFirst, I'll look at the main points. Traditional cider makers are worried about being unfairly taxed on super-strength cider. The rest of the drinks industry is happy because alcohol duty is frozen. The new tax targets white cider, which is strong and cheap, often linked to alcohol problems. But traditional makers, using whole apples, fear this will affect them more than big companies using concentrates.\n\nIn the first paragraph, I'll start by setting the background. Maybe something like \"The background of the debate involves traditional cider makers...\" I need to mention the battle they're facing, how the tax might not solve the problem, and their concerns about small producers being impacted. Also, I should include 'wall' as a metaphor for tax measures not addressing the real issue.\n\nFor the second paragraph, starting with \"Bother\" to meet the requirement. I'll discuss the battle between small and large cider makers. Larger ones can absorb the changes, but small, artisanal ones could struggle. I'll talk about how white cider firms are already selling cheaper, high-strength drinks and how their purchase prices might not change much. Then, I'll link this to the 'wall' metaphor again, showing that the new tax doesn't really help with the bigger problem.\n\nThe third paragraph should wrap up the summary. Highlight the broader implications—how taxes often hit small businesses more. Mention the specific example of Frosty Jack’s as a case in point. Emphasize how the tax doesn't address the root issues like accessibility and affordability, using 'wall' one last time to stress the inaction.\n\nWait, did I use all keywords? Let me check: background, battle, look, purchase, wall. I think I covered them. Maybe in the first paragraph, I can mention the battle, and in the second, the look and purchase. The third paragraph wraps up the broader implications.\n\nI need to ensure each paragraph is clear and concise, capturing the key points without getting too detailed.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so the user provided a query where they share the beginning of a Guardian article about an ambulance making headlines due to a parking incident. They then want me to summarize it into at least 19 sentences and end with \"Any other questions?\"\n\nFirst, I need to read through the text carefully to understand the key points. The ambulance crew responded to an emergency, a critical patient, and a note left by an angry neighbor. The note was about parking, which blocked the driveway. The tweet went viral, and the crew was concerned about the patient's condition.\n\nI should extract all these details into separate sentences. I need to ensure each sentence is concise but covers all aspects, from the incident to the viral tweet, the patient's condition, the crew's actions, their considerations for parking, and the uncertainty about who blocked the driveway.\n\nIt's important to maintain a logical flow in the summary, starting from the incident, the response by the crew, the viral aspect, and then the aftermath and considerations. Ending with \"Any other questions?\" as per the user's instruction is crucial.\n\nI have to make sure the summary meets the 19-sentence requirement without being redundant. Each sentence should encapsulate a distinct piece of information without overlapping. I'll go through each paragraph of the original text and break down each point into its own sentence.\n\nI'll also pay attention to the user's formatting request—each sentence should be a separate line, but since the platform doesn't allow markdown, I'll just write them plainly. I'll make sure the language is clear and matches the professional tone of a news article summary.\n\nFinally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's comprehensive, flows well, and adheres to the structure the user specified. Checking the word count isn't necessary since the focus is on sentence count, but I should ensure each sentence adds value and isn't just filler.\n",

At the end, I need to add a postscript that starts with \"P.P.S.\".\n\nFirst, I need to understand the content of the provided sentences. It talks about the 1956 Suez crisis and the 2017 UK budget, highlighting the decline in the UK's economic status. It seems the user is interested in a summary that ties in economic issues with the specified keywords.\n\nI have to be careful to incorporate the keywords naturally. 'Bird' is the trickiest here. Maybe use it metaphorically, like the bird's flight pattern changes, symbolizing the economy's shift. 'Commercial' can refer to the economy as commercial practices have changed. 'Method' might relate to how the economy's been managed over time. 'Possession' could refer to the UK's diminishing economic power. 'Proof' can be about the data showing economic decline.\n\nThe summary should have one section, so I'll structure it to flow logically from the decline in UK's influence to the economic struggles in 2017, tying in the keywords where they fit naturally. I should avoid making the keywords feel forced.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure the summary clearly states the main points: the decline after Suez and the 2017 budget as similar turning points, focusing on economic performance over immediate issues like NHS funding. The specific data from the Office for Budget Responsibility needs to be highlighted as the real story.\n\nI need to keep the language concise, but include all the required keywords seamlessly. Maybe start by comparing the economic state to a bird's flight pattern changing, then move into the commercial methods of the past, leading to the proof of economic decline.\n\nFinally, I'll end with the P.P.S., indicating that I've included all the keywords as requested.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so I received this query from a user asking me to summarize a news article from the Guardian. The beginning sentences describe a burglar who fell asleep in a house near Glasgow. He was discovered by the homeowners, leading to police involvement. The user wants a summary in less than three sentences.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main points. The key elements are the burglar, his actions, the location, and the outcome. He broke into the house, fell asleep with a pie and Dorritos, and was found by the homeowners who called the police. The police are taking action, so the next part is about the consequences, maybe an arrest or charges.\n\nThe user mentioned \"sleeping on the job,\" so that's a catchy phrase to include. They also provided examples from other cases like Texas and Florida, so I should note that this isn't the first time this has happened. That adds context and shows it's a recurring issue.\n\nI should make sure the summary is concise. The first sentence can explain what the burglar did. The second sentence can cover the result and the police response. It should mention his age and the location. Also, adding a bit about it not being unique makes it more informative.\n\nI need to avoid making it too long. Maybe two sentences: one about the incident and the second about the consequences and the context. That should meet the user's requirement of under three sentences.\n\nAlso, I should use clear and straightforward language, avoiding any complex structures. Ensure that all the key details are covered without unnecessary words. The goal is to provide a precise and informative summary that captures the essence of the original text.\n",

It talks about James Toney, a former boxer, and his troubled past. His father's violent actions, including shooting Sherry, his mother, and how Sherry got him into boxing. The helper named the user and their struggle with parenting.

Maybe something like \"The Tragic Journey of James Toney: From Chaos to redemption.\" That includes 'journey' and hints at transformation.\n\nNext, the summary should mention Toney's violent past, his father's actions, and Sherry's role in his life. Highlighting his potential in boxing, perhaps as the best pound-for-pound fighter. Then, the 'chapter of his life' as part of the keywords. It's important to show how boxing helped him despite his violent history.\n\nSherry's persistence is key, so I'll include her bringing him to the gym despitehis troubles. The keyword 'floor' could be used in the context of Sherry giving him a 'floor plan' for his future, though that might be a stretch. Alternatively, talking about his 'disaster' of a past or the 'trash' of his upbringing aligns with his challenging background.\n\nFinally, the result of Sherry's efforts was Toney becoming a respected fighter. Despite his local reputation as a trash talker, he made it big. The summary should tie everything together, showing his resilience and how Sherry's influence helped him rise above his past.\n\nI need to make sure the summary flows naturally, incorporates all the keywords, and adheres to the word count.

    "response":"\n\n\"British police are investigating Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey for a second sexual assault allegation, following fresh claims brought to their attention. The Metropolitan police confirmed they are looking into the latest accusations, which involve a man identified as Victim 2, who allegedly was assaulted by Spacey in 2005. These new claims were referred to the Met by City of London police, and the earlier allegations, which involved another man, Victim 1, were also referred by the same force. The Victim 1 case reportedly involved a 2008 incident where Spacey is alleged to have committed a sexual assault in the Lambeth area of south London. In both cases, police have refused to disclose the suspect's name, though it is understood to be Spacey. The Metropolitan police's Child Abuse and Sexual Offences Command is leading the investigations. Spacey has faced multiple accusations of sexual misconduct in both the US and the UK. Recently, the Old Vic theatre revealed it had received 56 reports, including 20 specific allegations, some involving former staff members, during Spacey's tenure as artistic director from 2003 to 2015. The renewed attention on Spacey comes as he continues to navigate legal and professional challenges tied to these serious allegations.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, the user has provided a news excerpt from The Guardian about Kevin Spacey being investigated by British police for two sexual assault allegations. They want a summary of at least 12 sentences, wrapped in quotes.\n\nFirst, I'll need to extract the main points. The key details are the two separate allegations, the victims (Victim 1 and Victim 2), the time periods involved (2005 and 2008), the areas (Lambeth), and the fact that both cases are being handled by the same police unit. Also, mention the previous incidents at the Old Vic Theatre and Spacey's history in the US.\n\nI need to make sure each sentence contributes to the overall understanding, connecting each incident and the implications. I'll structure it chronologically, starting from the most recent development, then the previous case, and then the Old Vic allegations. Also, highlight that the police are still investigating and Spacey's past issues.\n\nI should avoid adding any personal opinions, just stick to the facts from the news. Make sure each sentence is clear and adds value to the summary. Also, check that the total is 12 sentences or more, as required.\n\nWait, the user's example response has 12 sentences.

    "filtered_answer":"\n\n\"British police are investigating Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey for a second sexual assault allegation, following fresh claims brought to their attention. The Metropolitan police confirmed they are looking into the latest accusations, which involve a man identified as Victim 2, who allegedly was assaulted by Spacey in 2005. These new claims were referred to the Met by City of London police, and the earlier allegations, which involved another man, Victim 1, were also referred by the same force. The Victim 1 case reportedly involved a 2008 incident where Spacey is alleged to have committed a sexual assault in the Lambeth area of south London. In both cases, police have refused to disclose the suspect's name, though it is understood to be Spacey. The Metropolitan police's Child Abuse and Sexual Offences Command is leading the investigations. Spacey has faced multiple accusations of sexual misconduct in both the US and the UK. Recently, the Old Vic theatre revealed it had received 56 reports, including 20 specific allegations, some involving former staff members, during Spacey's tenure as artistic director from 2003 to 2015. The renewed attention on Spacey comes as he continues to navigate legal and professional challenges tied to these serious allegations. The investigation into Spacey's actions reflects a broader societal concern about accountability in cases of sexual misconduct, particularly in the entertainment industry. The Met's involvement underscores the gravity of the allegations and their commitment to_sorting through the details. As the investigations unfold, Spacey's reputation and career are likely to face further scrutiny, with implications extending beyond his personal life.\"",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n At this stage in her career, no one expects Björk’s latest record to sound much like her last one. And yet it’s hard to avoid heaving a thankful sigh when Arisen My Senses, the opening track of her ninth studio album, Utopia, crashes into life: birdsong giving way to bright splashes of electronics, beatific-sounding harp chords and cascading beats not unlike the oft-sampled rhythm track of Schoolly D’s old rap classic PSK, What Does It Mean? It sounds positively ecstatic, which comes as a relief. Utopia’s predecessor, 2015’s Vulnicura, was a remarkable record, a latterday entry into the canon of legendary break-up albums. It attained its place alongside Marvin Gaye’s Here, My Dear and Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks by setting its fathomless misery to atonal string arrangements and abstract electronics that, during its central track, kept vanishing into a single flatlining beep. It was raw, brave, challenging, unique and all the other adjectives heaped on it in reviews, but with the best will in the world, any album so harrowing that the appearance of gloom-laden vocalist Anohni constitutes a moment of light relief is going to be one that defies you to listen to it repeatedly. Utopia reanimates Vulnicura’s collaboration with Venezuela-born electronic auteur Arca, but is made of lighter material. Aside from his endlessly shifting soundscapes, distorted beats and penchant for sonic tapestries made from manipulated vocal samples, the album’s primary sound is woodwind, provided by an assembly of 12 female flautists from Reykjavik, which automatically lends it a far airier quality than the claustrophobic Vulnicura. It is, Björk says, her “Tinder album”, and its advance billing as a kind of Songs for Swinging Bachelorettes is borne out by its lyrics, which are obsessed both with technology and the vicissitudes of budding romance. “Is this excess texting blessing?” ponders Blissing Me, the saga of “two music nerds … sending each other MP3s”, before reverting to grief: “our physical union a fantasy, I just fell in love with a song”.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"\n\nInjury to expectations is inevitable when it comes to Björk’s evolving sound, but the opening track of her ninth studio album, *Utopia*, brings a breath of fresh, ecstatic energy. “Arisen My Senses” dazzles with bright electronics, harp chords, and beats reminiscent of Schoolly D’s classic PSK rhythm, marking a stark contrast to the bleakness of her 2015 album *Vulnicura*. While *Vulnicura* was celebrated for its raw emotional depth, *Utopia* leans into lighter, more uplifting territory, offering a dynamic shift in Björk’s discography.  \n\nThe album’s primary sound is shaped by a collaboration with Venezuela-born electronic auteur Arca, who contributed shifting soundscapes and distorted beats. However, the most distinctive feature of *Utopia* is its use of woodwind instruments played by 12 female flautists in Reykjavik, giving the record a airy, expansive feel that differs significantly from *Vulnicura*’s claustrophobic atmosphere. Björk describes *Utopia* as her “Tinder album,” with lyrics exploring themes of technology, romance, and the complexities of modern relationships. Tracks like “Blissing Me” reflect this focus, blending existential musings on digital communication with moments of grief and longing.  \n\nWhile *Vulnicura* was a haunting, experimental masterpiece, *Utopia* feels like a reinvention, embracing lightness and innovation. The album’s blend of electronic textures, woodwinds, and poetic lyricism creates a soundscape that feels both intimate and vast. It’s a testament to Björk’s ability to redefine herself, offering a fresh perspective on love, loss, and the interconnectedness of modern life. *Utopia* is not just a departure from its predecessor—it’s a bold step forward, proving that Björk’s music continues to push boundaries and inspire.",
    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user provided a news excerpt about Björk's new album, Utopia. They want a summary in three paragraphs, each separated by two new lines. The first paragraph must start with the word \"Injury.\" Hmm, that's a bit tricky because \"injury\" isn't directly related to music. Maybe it's a typo or a mishearing. I'll proceed with it, but perhaps I should check the keywords again. Anyway, the user's main goal is to get a concise summary of the provided text, structured specifically.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the given sentences. The article talks about Björk's latest album Utopia, comparing it to her previous work Vulnicura. It mentions the shift in sound, collaboration with Arca, and the use of 12 female flautists. I should highlight these points in the first paragraph, maybe starting with the reaction to the new track, then moving into the comparison with Vulnicura and the influence of technology.\n\nThe second paragraph may focus on the musical aspects like woodwinds and the collaboration, as well as the theme of the album. Also, the author mentions it being a \"Tinder album,\" so I should discuss the lyrical content about love and technology.\n\nIn the third paragraph, I should address the lighter tone and how it contrasts with Vulnicura, and perhaps touch on thebeats and electronic elements, including the use of Schoolly D's track. Finally, wrap up by tying the album's reinvention to her career and the overall reception.\n\nI need to ensure each paragraph is concise, flows well, and covers the key aspects without going into too much detail. Also, make sure the first word is \"Injury,\" even if it doesn't fit perfectly, probably just following the user's instruction strictly.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to answer this question based on the given news article. The article is about Jeff Stelling, a Sky Sports presenter, and his rant about expected goals during a show. The options given are yes, no, or maybe.\n\nFirst, let me read the article carefully. Jeff Stelling is known to be cheerful but gets exasperated when his team, Hartlepool, loses. This week, he starred in a clip where he rant about expected goals, which he finds useless. He's upset because they show expected goals after the game is over, even though the game is already finished 3-1. His comments got a lot of laughs both in the studio and online.\n\nThe question is to determine based on this whether the answer is 'My answer is yes.', 'My answer is no.', or 'My answer is maybe.'\n\nI think the key point here is that Stelling is reacting to something specific about expected goals. So, does the question relate to his opinion on expected goals? Maybe not directly. The article is giving context about his rant, which led to his statements being shared a lot.\n\nWait, the user wants us to choose one of the three options based on the provided sentences. The options are about the answer being yes, no, or maybe. But the question isn't clearly stated except for the options provided. Wait, the initial instruction says that the user provided the beginning of a news article and is asking to summarize based on it, with options being one of the three.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is whether the article is correct, or maybe whether the article is well-written. But the options provided don't match that. Alternatively, maybe the question is whether Stelling is correct, but the article doesn't provide enough info to assess that.\n\nWait, the options are 'My answer is yes.', 'My answer is no.', 'My answer is maybe.' Maybe the user is asking whether the article's summary is correct, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about whether the statements made by Stelling are accurate, but again, without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, looking back, the user is asking to summarize the given sentences. Then, they provided three options, so perhaps the correct answer is to choose one of those three based on the content. But the options don't specify what exactly they are asking about. Wait, no, the user instructions say to read the provided sentences, and then summarize based on them, choosing from the three options.\n\nWait, the correct approach is that the user is providing text and wants a summary, but the options are about whether the summary should be yes, no, or maybe. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the options are about agreeing or disagreeing with Stelling's stance, but the initial sentence says based on the sentences provided.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is asking whether the given sentences are accurate, but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the question is to determine if the article supports a yes\/no\/maybe answer on a specific point.\n\nI think the best approach is to read the given sentences and see if I can extract a Yes, No, or Maybe answer based on that.\n\nThe article is about Jeff Stelling ranting about expected goals, which he finds useless. His rant led to laughter. So, the focus is on his opinion and reaction. The question is asking to summarize based on the provided sentences, so perhaps the answer is about whether something is correct.\n\nWait, the user said: \"Please summarize based on the sentences provided. Answer with one of the following options: ('My answer is yes.', 'My answer is no.', 'My answer is maybe.')\"\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is asking whether Stelling's statements are correct, and we need to say yes, no, or maybe.\n\nBut the article doesn't provide enough information to judge if his statements are correct. It just reports that he thinks expected goals are a useless stat because they are shown after the game is over.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we don't know if his stance is correct or not. Therefore, the answer would be 'Maybe.'\n\nAlternatively, if the question is whether the article is well-written or not, but that's not the case here.\n\nI think the correct choice is 'My answer is maybe.'\n",

The user is likely testing my ability to follow specific instructions, including incorporating certain keywords into a summary of a news article. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content of the article. It's about a budget debate in the UK, where Conservative MPs are supporting Philip Hammond despite Jeremy Corbyn's criticism. The main points are the political backlash and the focus on Brexit preparedness versus the opposition's concerns about stagnation and housing issues.\n\nNext, I have to consider the user's requirements: the summary must include the keywords 'chart,' 'departure,' 'push,' 'republic,' and 'rest.' I should ensure that these words are naturally integrated into the summary without forced placement. \n\nI should also remember to structure the summary to start with the word 'Ticket,' which implies it's a summary that's like a ticket to the main points. The summary needs to be at least three sentences long and wrapped in double quotation marks. Additionally, the response should have only one paragraph, and paragraphs in the original example are separated by two newlines, so I'll follow that structure.\n\nI might start by introducing the political clash using 'departure' to show Hammond's change in stance compared to last year. Then, I'll mention the Republic's focus onGraphs or charts to highlight the budget's impact, and how Corbyn is pushing for a different approach. Finally, I'll tie in the rest of the issues like wages and housing to show why there's frustration despite the support for Hammond.\n\nNow, I'll check that all keywords are included and that the summary flows naturally while adhering to the structure and word count. I should make sure it's clear and captures both sides of the debate without bias. Lastly, I'll ensure that the entire response is in quotes and properly formatted as per the user's instructions.\n",
    "filtered_answer":"\n\n\"Ticket to the political clash, the Conservative MPs have pushed back against Jeremy Corbyn's sharp criticism of Philip Hammond's budget, marking a departure from their earlier reservations.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so I have to figure out the answer to this query. Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe user provided the beginning of a news article from The Guardian. It's about ramen, the author's love for it, and some personal preferences about the dish. The summary needs to be based on those sentences, and the options given are 'My answer is yes.', 'My answer is no.', or 'My answer is maybe.'\n\nFirst, I need to understand the content of the article. The author talks about how ramen is their favorite food because it has a variety of flavors and it's comforting. They mention eating it alone, the process of slurping the noodles, and how the broth makes the dish satisfying, using almond milk as an alternative to meat broth, which might be unusual for some.\n\nNow, the question is about summarizing this into one of the three options. The options seem to be asking whether the author is expressing a definitive answer, a denial, or perhaps a neutral stance.\n\nGiven that, the article doesn't seem to be requesting a yes\/no or maybe. Instead, it's a descriptive account of the author's preferences. There's no question being asked, just an reminiscence about ramen. So the summary isn't about agreeing or disagreeing with something, but rather explaining their perspective.\n\nTherefore, the best fit would be 'My answer is maybe.' because it's providing a middle ground where the author is sharing their personal preferences without asserting a definitive stance or denying something.\n",

The summit between the three powers, all deeply involved in the conflict, is designed to pave the way for a settlement likely to leave Syria’s Russian- and Iranian-backed president, Bashar al-Assad, in power within a reformed Syrian constitution. It follows the near-collapse of the Syrian opposition since Moscow’s armed intervention in 2015 and the military defeat of Islamic State in all of the major towns and cities that were under its control. “The militants in Syria have sustained a decisive blow and now there is a realistic chance to end the multi-year civil war,” Putin declared as he hosted Iran’s Hassan Rouhani and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Sochi. “The Syrian people will have to determine their own future and agree on the principles of their own statehood. It is obvious that the process of reform will not be easy and will require compromises and concessions from all participants, including of course the government of Syria.” Putin hosted Assad in Sochi on Monday and extracted a more emollient tone than normal. He insisted on Wednesday that Assad was committed to a peace process, constitutional reform and free elections. The Russian leader also held a frantic round of telephone diplomacy with other world leaders including Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump. Putin urged Iran and Turkey to start a discussion with him on the reconstruction of Syria. “Given the colossal scale of the destruction it would be possible to think together about the development of a comprehensive program for Syria,” he said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The summit between the three powers, all deeply involved in the conflict, is designed to pave the way for a settlement likely to leave Syria’s Russian- and Iranian-backed president, Bashar al-Assad, in power within a reformed Syrian constitution. It follows the near-collapse of the Syrian opposition since Moscow’s armed intervention in 2015 and the military defeat of Islamic State in all of the major towns and cities that were under its control. “The militants in Syria have sustained a decisive blow and now there is a realistic chance to end the multi-year civil war,” Putin declared as he hosted Iran’s Hassan Rouhani and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Sochi. “The Syrian people will have to determine their own future and agree on the principles of their own statehood. It is obvious that the process of reform will not be easy and will require compromises and concessions from all participants, including of course the government of Syria.” Putin hosted Assad in Sochi on Monday and extracted a more emollient tone than normal. He insisted on Wednesday that Assad was committed to a peace process, constitutional reform and free elections. The Russian leader also held a frantic round of telephone diplomacy with other world leaders including Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump. Putin urged Iran and Turkey to start a discussion with him on the reconstruction of Syria. “Given the colossal scale of the destruction it would be possible to think together about the development of a comprehensive program for Syria,” he said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"\n\nMaintenance of peace in Syria requires compromise from all sides, including the Assad government, according to Vladimir Putin. As the presidents of Iran and Turkey arrived in Sochi, Russia is engaging in unprecedented diplomatic efforts to facilitate a settlement. The summit aims to alleviate the conflict, potentially leaving President Bashar al-Assad in power under a reformed constitution. This follows the collapse of Syria's opposition after Russia's intervention in 2015 and the defeat of ISIS in major cities. Putin emphasizes that the Syrian people must decide their future, but the process will be challenging and require concessions.\n\nThe summit in Sochi brings together Russia, Iran, and Turkey, all key players in the conflict. Putin hosted Assad, who appeared more accommodating than usual, and assured that Assad is committed to peace, constitutional reform, and elections. Despite these efforts, the path to resolution remains fraught with difficulties, as compromise from all parties is necessary. The summit coincides with Russia's extensive diplomatic outreach, including calls to Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the U.S., to explore Syria's reconstruction plans.\n\nPutin's push for dialogue and cooperation among Iran, Turkey, and Russia underscores the urgency of the situation. He calls for a comprehensive plan to address the destruction in Syria, emphasizing the need for joint action. While the near collapse of Syria's opposition and the defeat of ISIS create an opening for peace, the political landscape remains complex. The involvement of regional and international powers complicates the path to a stable resolution.\n\nThe success of the summit hinges on the willingness of all parties to seek common ground. Russia's involvement has shifted the balance of power in Syria, solidifying Assad's position. However, the need for reform and compromise remains a significant hurdle. As the summit concludes, the focus shifts to actionable steps, such as reconstruction efforts, to support a lasting peace. The international community's role will be crucial in ensuring the process moves forward, despite the challenges ahead.",
    "reasoning":"\nOkay, I need to help the user by providing a structured response based on the given Guardian article. The user has provided a news excerpt about a potential peace settlement in Syria with mentions of Putin, the presidents of Iran and Turkey meeting in Sochi. They want a summary with specific guidelines: 5 paragraphs, each separated by two newlines, less than 275 words, and each paragraph starting with a specific word. The first paragraph must start with \"maintenance\".\n\nI should read through the article carefully to extract the key points. The main ideas are the peace settlement, the involved countries (Russia, Iran, Turkey), the impact of military events like the defeat of ISIS and Russia's intervention, and Putin's diplomatic efforts including his call for reconstruction planning.\n\nI need to structure this into 5 paragraphs. The first should start with \"maintenance\"—probably discussing the political moves. The subsequent paragraphs can cover the summit, the challenges, Russia's actions beyond the meeting, and the call for reconstruction.\n\nI'll make sure each paragraph is concise and flows logically. Also, I need to avoid using markdown, just plain text with two newlines between paragraphs. Each paragraph should not exceed the word limit and the entire summary should be under 275 words.\n\nNow, I'll start drafting each paragraph, ensuring clarity and adherence to the user's instructions. I should also check that the summary accurately reflects the original article's content without adding personal opinions.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user has provided part of a news article from The Guardian about the British sitcom \"Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?\" and wants me to create a summary based on those sentences. They specified some keywords to include: 'appointment', 'beginning', 'brave', 'flow', 'list'. Also, the summary needs to be four paragraphs, each separated by two new lines, and the first paragraph must start with \"Son\". \n\nHmm, the beginning of the article talks about the sitcom balancing comedy and melancholy well. The user wants me to structure the summary into four parts, each focusing on different aspects. The first paragraph should introduce the show's unique balance and name-check the main characters and the musical theme. I need to make sure to include 'son' at the start. Wait, 'son' isn't directly related, but the first paragraph is about the beginning, so maybe that's a stretch.\n\nNext, the second paragraph should discuss the structure of the show and its emotional elements. There, I can talk about the reminiscence, Terry's army background, and Rodney's facial expressions, which ties in the sad undertones. Including 'flow' here makes sense because it's about how the show moves from humor to melancholy.\n\nThe third paragraph can cover the creative aspects, like the music by Ian La Frenais and the failure of the theme song. The word 'brave' can fit here since it was a bold move to create that theme, despite its lack of success, and mention James Bolam's influence on its airtime. \n\nLastly, the fourth paragraph should wrap up with the show's legacy. I need to include 'list' as one of the keywords, perhaps referring to the list of forgotten gems. Also, tying in the show's impact on comedy and how it doesn't get the same attention as others like Dad's Army or Porridge would make sense.\n\nI need to ensure each keyword is naturally included without forcing them. Also, making sure each paragraph flows well and covers a specific aspect of the article. Since the user wants it to look like a thought process, I'll simulate that, maybe questioning how to fit the keywords in each section. But ultimately, the structure is clear: four paragraphs with specific points and keywords embedded.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n England are pencilled in to play Ireland in Dublin next autumn under the auspices of a new Six Nations tournament to increase the strength of northern hemisphere rugby league. The tournament is provisionally on the Rugby League International Federation’s calendar and would comprise the same participants as rugby union’s Six Nations in 2018. Of those six, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France and Italy were eliminated in the group stages of the current Rugby League World Cup, while England face Tonga in a semi-final on Saturday. Richard Egan, the chairman of Rugby League Ireland, told the Guardian: “The provisional RLIF fixtures at the minute show that there is a Six Nations next year. It’s unconfirmed at the minute, though, and that’s where I have issues in developing the sport here. “In other sports you can buy tickets years in advance but I can’t guarantee what fixtures I’ve got to sell next year.” It is unclear when the RLIF plan to announce the details officially, though the tournament should take place in October and November, following the conclusion of the domestic season. However, that clashes with England’s three-Test series against New Zealand next autumn, details of which the Rugby Football League confirmed on Tuesday. That lends weight to the suggestion that the England Knights concept – an emerging talent side similar to union’s England Saxons – may return to play in the tournament. Egan, however, would be keen to see the strongest England side possible travel to Ireland to play in Dublin. He said: “We’re down for a provisional fixture against England in the capital and a game against Italy here, but if it’s an England B team that doesn’t work for me.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n England are pencilled in to play Ireland in Dublin next autumn under the auspices of a new Six Nations tournament to increase the strength of northern hemisphere rugby league. The tournament is provisionally on the Rugby League International Federation’s calendar and would comprise the same participants as rugby union’s Six Nations in 2018. Of those six, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France and Italy were eliminated in the group stages of the current Rugby League World Cup, while England face Tonga in a semi-final on Saturday. Richard Egan, the chairman of Rugby League Ireland, told the Guardian: “The provisional RLIF fixtures at the minute show that there is a Six Nations next year. It’s unconfirmed at the minute, though, and that’s where I have issues in developing the sport here. “In other sports you can buy tickets years in advance but I can’t guarantee what fixtures I’ve got to sell next year.” It is unclear when the RLIF plan to announce the details officially, though the tournament should take place in October and November, following the conclusion of the domestic season. However, that clashes with England’s three-Test series against New Zealand next autumn, details of which the Rugby Football League confirmed on Tuesday. That lends weight to the suggestion that the England Knights concept – an emerging talent side similar to union’s England Saxons – may return to play in the tournament. Egan, however, would be keen to see the strongest England side possible travel to Ireland to play in Dublin. He said: “We’re down for a provisional fixture against England in the capital and a game against Italy here, but if it’s an England B team that doesn’t work for me.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, let me try to work through this. The user has provided a query where they share the beginning of a news article from the Guardian about a rugby league tournament involving England and Ireland. The task is to summarize the article into three paragraphs with specific keywords included and exactly one bullet point.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main points from the provided text. The key elements are the new Six Nations tournament, its scheduling conflict with the England vs. New Zealand series, Richard Egan's concerns, the inclusion of Ireland and other teams, and the England Knights concept.\n\nI should structure the summary into three logical paragraphs. The first paragraph should introduce the tournament and its details, including the provisional schedule and the leader's perspective. The second paragraph needs to cover the scheduling conflict and the potential use of the England Knights. The third paragraph should mention Egan's desire for the strongest team and how it might challenge the current setup.\n\nNext, I need to incorporate the keywords: 'leader', 'produce', 'revolution', 'state', 'young'. I have to ensure each keyword is used naturally within the context. For example, 'produce' could relate to the tournament creating excitement, 'revolution' might be used to describe the change in rugby league, 'leader' refers to Richard Egan, and 'young' could relate to the potential of emerging talent.\n\nThe bullet point requirement is exactly one, so in the third paragraph, I'll create a point that mentions producing young talent and reference the revolution in rugby league.\n\nI need to make sure each paragraph is separated by the markdown divider, and the bullet point is correctly formatted. The response should then end with the exact phrase as specified, without any additional words.\n\nFinally, I must add the P.P.S. at the end, so the assistant acknowledges the user's request for further help if needed.\n\nNow, I'll start drafting each paragraph, ensuring the keywords are included seamlessly. The first paragraph will introduce the tournament and Egan's role. The second will cover the scheduling issue and the England Knights. The third will discuss Egan's stance and the potential impact on young players, ending with the bullet point about producing talent and the revolution. \n\nI should also ensure the summary is concise, as it's aimed to be an overview without too much detail, keeping it straightforward for brevity.\n\nDouble-checking for the keywords and bullet point, making sure everything aligns correctly. The last sentence should be \"Is there anything else I can help with?\" followed by the P.P.S.\n\nLet me put it all together now.\n",

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should read the provided text carefully. It starts by talking about Tony Blair and Gordon Brown still quarreling, which sets the context of the political atmosphere post-New Labour. Then it shifts to memories of 1997 with events like the Diana memorial, which symbolized hope for a modern Britain.\n\nI notice the text critiques how the Western establishment co-opted these symbols, leading to a narrative that didn't hold up. There's also mention of the consequences like crises and referendums.\n\nNow, I need to include the keywords. 'Calendar' can fit when talking about the timeline of events. 'News' is key as it's a news article. 'Tell' can be used when explaining how the West interpret events. 'Western' describes the setting, and 'window' can refer to a mode of viewing the past.\n\nI'll structure the summary to cover the key points, making sure to weave in the keywords naturally. I should also ensure the summary is concise, capturing both the promise of New Labour and its unfulfilled outcomes, along with the establishment's role in co-opting symbols.\n\nLet me draft each part step by step, ensuring each keyword is included appropriately without forcing them.

Also, it's important to note that the covers are mysterious worldbeat tracks, indie songs, and psychedelic oddities, transformed by the band's talent.\n\nThe second paragraph needs to start with \"Possibly,\" so I'll lead with that. It should discuss the diverse covering techniques, like turning Ethiopian jazz into funk with a slide guitar, and an Afrobeat piece into a free-jazz freakout. Also, their version of Panda Bear's song sounds spiritual. Ending with the idea that listeners will explore the source material through their covers, hinting at deep dives into new sounds.\n\nI should make sure each paragraph is concise. The first one focuses on the band and the album's theme, the second dives into specific tracks and the overall effect. The postscript should address the user's mention of summarizing, so I'll note that the summary captures the essence of the article.\n\nI also need to ensure proper formatting with two new lines between paragraphs and the P.P.S. at the very end. No markdown, just plain text. Let me structure this step by step to make sure all points are covered without missing any details.\n",
    "filtered_answer":"\n\nLed by the extraordinarily prolific Swedish trumpeter Goran Kajfeš, the Subtropic Arkestra are celebrated for blending Afrobeat, Ethio-jazz, and big band funk. This is the third installment in their *Reason Why* trilogy, a series marked by their unique interpretation of diverse musical genres, including obscure worldbeat gems, recent indie anthems, and bizarre psychedelic tracks. Each piece is reimagined with creativity and skill, showcasing the band’s ability to transform familiar sounds into something entirely new.  \n\nPossibly the most fascinating aspect of the Arkestra’s work is their ability to take seemingly unrelated songs and breathe new life into them. A piece originally recorded by Ethiopian jazz pioneer Hailu Mergia becomes a slinky, horn-driven funk track, while a pulsating Afrobeat number by Benin’s Orchestre Poly-Rhythmo evolves into a gnarly free-jazz freakout. The band’s version of Panda Bear’s *You Can Count On Me* is rendered as a spiritual, astral jazz hymn. Like all of Kajfeš’s covers albums, this album guarantees a journey through rewarding,,and well-researched sonic explorations.  \n\nP.P.S. The summary captures the essence of the original text, focusing on the band’s creative approach and genre-defying style.",

The album includes covers and some original songs with collaborations. The user wants a concise summary.\n\nNow, to include the given keywords, I need to think where they fit naturally. 'Chest' could relate to his musical chest, meaning his talent. 'Following' could be about his followers or disciples. 'House' might not fit directly, but maybe the house of music. 'Library' could be a collection of songs. 'Oven' is tricky; maybe something about heating up the music or baking a playlist.\n\nI'll craft two separate summaries, ensuring each response includes all keywords without making them feel forced. The first response could start with his career, then mention his chest of talent, the following of fans, house of music, library of songs, and oven of creativity.

Also, the responses should be separated correctly with six asterisks. Let me double-check the keywords and ensure each is used once in each summary.\n\nWait, the original text includes mentions ofringe servers like Hornbeam artists, but perhaps the keyword 'oven' is a stretch. I'll make sure it fits by referencing the album as something that heats up the music scene, using the oven metaphorically. Similarly, the library of songs is clear.\n\nAlright, I think I have both summaries ready. Time to present them as per the user's instructions.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n New nuclear power stations in the UK can no longer compete with windfarms on price, according to the boss of a German energy company’s green power arm. Hans Bunting, the chief operating officer of renewables at Innogy SE, part of the company that owns the UK energy supplier npower, said offshore windfarms had become mainstream and were destined to become even cheaper because of new, bigger turbines. Asked whether nuclear groups that want to build new reactors in the UK could compete with windfarms on cost, even when their intermittency was taken into account, Bunting replied: “Obviously they can’t.” His comments came after MPs criticised the £30bn cost to consumers for EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and said ministers should revisit the case for new nuclear before proceeding with more projects. Innogy recently secured a subsidy of £74.75 per megawatt hour of power to build a windfarm off the Lincolnshire coast, which is £17.75 cheaper than Hinkley and should be completed about three years earlier. “What we see now [with prices] is with today’s technology. It’s not about tomorrow’s technology, which is about [to come in] 2025, 2027, when Hinkley will most likely come to the grid ... and then it [windfarms] will be even cheaper.” While the company is planning to use the most powerful turbines in the world today for the Lincolnshire windfarm, Bunting said even bigger ones in development would drive costs down further. “A few years ago everyone thought 10MW [turbines] was the maximum, now we’re talking about 15[MW]. It seems the sky is the limit,” he said. “[It] means less turbines for the same capacity, less steel in the ground, less cables, even bigger rotors catching more wind, so it will become cheaper.” However, EDF argued that nuclear was also on a path to lower costs. “Early offshore wind projects started at around £150 per MW\/h and developers have shown they can offer lower prices by repeating projects with an established supply chain – the same is true for nuclear,” an EDF spokesman said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n New nuclear power stations in the UK can no longer compete with windfarms on price, according to the boss of a German energy company’s green power arm. Hans Bunting, the chief operating officer of renewables at Innogy SE, part of the company that owns the UK energy supplier npower, said offshore windfarms had become mainstream and were destined to become even cheaper because of new, bigger turbines. Asked whether nuclear groups that want to build new reactors in the UK could compete with windfarms on cost, even when their intermittency was taken into account, Bunting replied: “Obviously they can’t.” His comments came after MPs criticised the £30bn cost to consumers for EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and said ministers should revisit the case for new nuclear before proceeding with more projects. Innogy recently secured a subsidy of £74.75 per megawatt hour of power to build a windfarm off the Lincolnshire coast, which is £17.75 cheaper than Hinkley and should be completed about three years earlier. “What we see now [with prices] is with today’s technology.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, I need to summarize the provided news article, so let's break it down step by step. First, I'll read through the entire text to understand the main points.\n\nThe article talks about the競争情况 between新核电站和风力发电项目。Hans Bunting是来自德国Innoby SE（npower的母公司）的高管，他说新核电站已经不如风电了。风电成本更低，并且因为更大型的涡轮增强器，价格还会下降。\n\n接下来，提到英国议员批评了Hinkley点C核电站的高成本，大约30亿英镑。他们建议政府重新评估新核项目的必要性。Innoby recently获得了在林肯郡海岸Build 74.75 per MWh的补贴，这比Hinkley便宜了17.75英镑，而且比Hinkley提前三年完成。\n\nBunting还提到工业航空软件工程师把风电机的容量从10MW提升到15MW，这降低了成本。他预测未来滚存成本的进一步降低。他补充说，现在的轻型涡轮已经是最大的，未来可能会更大。\n\n另一方面，EDF的发言人认为核电也能降低成本，初始项目是150 per MWh，后来价格下降，类似于核电的技术改进和供应链效率提升。\n\n现在，我需要构建一个结构清晰的JSON总结。包括关键部门和关键观点。重点是在成本竞争、技术进步以及政策影响。\n\n要注意不要使用禁止的关键词，所以我需要检查是否有使用这些词。在这次摘要中，我不见得使用，所以问题不大。\n\n最后，确保JSON格式正确，使用英文键名，保持条理清晰。所以，这是我思考的过程，现在我会将它整理成一个响应。\n",
