Who wouldn’t? A writer whose imagination transfixed the world, whose riches now exceed those of the Queen, but who has founded a children’s charity, pays her taxes in full, and remains both poised and politically engaged: as role models go, it is hard to think of a better one. So I was pleased when my seven-year-old son went Harry Potter crazy. Having never read to himself before, he was suddenly racing through book after book, his bedside light on late into the night. His brother and several of his friends caught the bug – just as the Suez canal flowed through Clarissa Eden’s drawing room, Hogwarts overshadowed our house, as children constantly dashed about on broomsticks, casting spells and looking for snitches. It was impressive to see the “Harry Potter effect” in action: the magical power that, in the two decades since its first publication, has revitalised the children’s publishing industry, encouraged millions of children to read, sold more than 400m copies across the world, and generated a cultural empire worth £20bn. Less pleasant, however, was the realisation that there was a marketing juggernaut poised to capitalise on my son’s enthusiasm.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, let me try to figure out what the user is asking for here. They provided a news article excerpt from The Guardian about the influence of Harry Potter on a family. The user then shared a paraphrase response and included instructions on how to structure the answer. \n\nHmm, I see the user wants me to paraphrase the provided text but in a specific format: two paragraphs, under 177 words, using a markdown divider. They also want me to think about the thought process of someone tackling this task. So, they want me to write a sample of how someone would break down the problem, analyze it, and then come up with the solution.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the original text. It's about a parent who wasn't a fan of Harry Potter but appreciated the impact it had on their children. The family got into Harry Potter, leading to aterms of cultural significance and the massive marketing that came with it.\n\nNow, the user wants a paraphrase in two paragraphs. So I should identify the main points: the personal involvement of the family, the broader impact of Harry Potter on reading habits and the industry, and then the negative aspect of commercialization.\n\nI should make sure to keep each paragraph concise. The first paragraph can focus on the family's experience—how the children embraced Harry Potter, the nighttime reading, and the brothers and friends getting involved. The second paragraph can address the marketing explosion and the shift from a simple book to a massive industry, which the parent finds less-than-ideal.\n\nI need to ensure that the paraphrase captures all these elements without copying the original text. Also, the thinking process should reflect how someone decides on the structure, chooses the right words, and ensures the paraphrase meets the word limit and formatting requirements.\n\nSo, considering all this, I'll structure the thought process to show understanding of the key points, the need to rephrase effectively, and the attention to formatting instructions. I should make sure the final answer is clear, concise, and accurately reflects the original article's content while being consistent with the user's specific instructions.\n",

Originally extended by modernist architect Leslie Martin in 1970, it has now received a sensitive £8.7m expansion by Jamie Fobert, including remodelled gallery spaces and an education wing, cafe and shop around a new courtyard. • Opens 10 February, Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge. Hope to Nope: Politics and Graphics 2008-2018 at the Design Museum From the endless imitations of Shepard Fairey’s seminal Hope poster for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, to the inventive plethora of Donald Trump memes, this exhibition will show how graphic design’s engagement with politics has evolved over the last decade. Featuring the work of high-profile and amateur designers, in campaign billboards, T-shirts and cartoons, it will show graphic design’s power as a tool for political discussion, debate and provocation. • Opens 28 March, Design Museum, London. Windermere Jetty Museum by Carmody Groarke A cluster of copper-clad sheds nestles on the edge of Windermere in the Lake District, signalling the new home for the Jetty Museum, a fascinating little institution that has been telling the story of boats and boatsmen since the 1940s. The new £16m complex includes a wet dock, allowing boats to be displayed on water within the museum, and a new workshop for visitors to see the conservation of steam launches, sailing yachts and motor boats in action. • Opens 2018, Windermere Jetty Museum, Bowness-on-Windermere. Royal Academy of Arts development by David Chipperfield “A small amount of architecture for a profound result,” is how Sir David Chipperfield describes his £50m series of surgical interventions in the Royal Academy’s two-acre site, designed to link Burlington House on Piccadilly with Burlington Gardens, behind it, for the first time.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Originally extended by modernist architect Leslie Martin in 1970, it has now received a sensitive £8.7m expansion by Jamie Fobert, including remodelled gallery spaces and an education wing, cafe and shop around a new courtyard. • Opens 10 February, Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge. Hope to Nope: Politics and Graphics 2008-2018 at the Design Museum From the endless imitations of Shepard Fairey’s seminal Hope poster for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, to the inventive plethora of Donald Trump memes, this exhibition will show how graphic design’s engagement with politics has evolved over the last decade. Featuring the work of high-profile and amateur designers, in campaign billboards, T-shirts and cartoons, it will show graphic design’s power as a tool for political discussion, debate and provocation. • Opens 28 March, Design Museum, London. Windermere Jetty Museum by Carmody Groarke A cluster of copper-clad sheds nestles on the edge of Windermere in the Lake District, signalling the new home for the Jetty Museum, a fascinating little institution that has been telling the story of boats and boatsmen since the 1940s. The new £16m complex includes a wet dock, allowing boats to be displayed on water within the museum, and a new workshop for visitors to see the conservation of steam launches, sailing yachts and motor boats in action. • Opens 2018, Windermere Jetty Museum, Bowness-on-Windermere. Royal Academy of Arts development by David Chipperfield “A small amount of architecture for a profound result,” is how Sir David Chipperfield describes his £50m series of surgical interventions in the Royal Academy’s two-acre site, designed to link Burlington House on Piccadilly with Burlington Gardens, behind it, for the first time.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, I'm looking at this query where the user provided the beginning sentences of a Guardian article about various new developments in the arts and culture sector. The user wants me to paraphrase these sentences and wrap the response in double quotation marks. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. It's about three different projects: Kettle's Yard in Cambridge, an exhibition at the Design Museum, Windermere Jetty Museum, and the Royal Academy's development. Each has a brief description with openings dates and architects or curators involved.\n\nThe user is asking for a paraphrase, so I should restate the information in my own words without changing the original meaning. I need to make sure each point is clear and concise. I'll start by introducing each project with a sentence, then provide details about their expansions, exhibitions, and features.\n\nI should ensure the flow is natural, perhaps starting with Kettle's Yard since it's the first in the original text. Then move on to the Design Museum exhibition, followed by the museum near Windermere, and finally the Royal Academy's development.\n\nI'll also pay attention to retain all key information: the locations, the people involved, the dates, and the significance of each development. It's important to highlight what each project offers—like the gallery spaces, the new courtyard, the political graphic designs, the museum's focus on boat conservation, and the architectural linkages.\n\nI'll paraphrase each paragraph, maybe combining some sentences for better readability without losing any essential details. Finally, I'll wrap the entire response in double quotes as the user instructed.\n\nI think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll proceed to paraphrase each section carefully, making sure each part is accurately represented and flows well together.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I'm trying to help paraphrase the given news article. The user provided a detailed set of instructions, so I need to make sure I follow them closely. The article is about Cheyenne Mangold and a workshop for medical students learning abortion techniques using a papaya model. \n\nFirst, I need to read through the original text carefully to understand the key points. The main elements are Cheyenne's first time performing an abortion, the use of a papaya as a simulation, the workshop's purpose, and the context of decreasing abortion providers in the US.\n\nThe user wants a paraphrase of at least 169 words, divided into exactly 3 bullet points using markdown. They also mentioned that the response should be generated using the 'think' and 'explain' steps, but I should avoid markdown elsewhere. So I need to structure my thoughts first.\n\nPoint 1: Cheyenne's experience with the papaya. She was nervous and used pincers on the papaya, which didn't cause pain because it's a fruit. This should be the first bullet.\n\nPoint 2: The workshop's broader purpose. It's from a non-profit addressing the gap in medical education about contraception and abortion, preparing providers for potentially illegal practices. Use basic tools and the papaya as a model.\n\nPoint 3: The scarcity of abortion providers in the US, with the workshop aiming to train the next generation, signaling a critical shortage.\n\nI need to make each bullet concise but comprehensive enough to cover the main ideas without being too wordy. I should ensure that each bullet point is distinct and flows well. Also, check that the total word count is met, but each bullet should ideally be about 60 words each to sum up to 180.\n\nI should also avoid using any markdown in the thinking but make sure the final response uses markdown bullet points as specified. I'll have to use colons after each bullet point and make sure they're properly formatted. \n\nLooking out for any specific terms that need to be retained, like 'cervix,' 'womb,' 'no-frills kit,' 'covert abortions,' etc., to ensure the paraphrase doesn't lose any important details. Also, mention the number of participants to add context about the workshop's impact.\n\nAnother thing is the transition from practice to real situations, emphasizing the urgency of the workshop. Maybe I can frame it as a response to legal challenges or shortages in rural areas.\n\nNow, drafting each bullet point, ensuring they are clear, concise, and cover all necessary aspects without overlap. I'll start with Cheyenne's experience, move to the workshop's mission, and conclude with the critical issue facing abortion providers.\n\nI also need to make sure that the language is formal yet accessible, avoiding overly technical terms since the audience might not be experts. However, given the subject matter, some medical terms are necessary.\n\nFinally, I'll review to ensure each bullet is around 60 words and that together they meet the word count requirement. Check for any redundancy and clarify the intent in each point to maintain coherence.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n It is rare to come across a work of history that so obviously wants to be a literary masterpiece. Roughly the length of War and Peace, The House of Government aims to capture the rise and fall of Bolshevism through a building and its residents, via a study in eschatology – the creation of an apocalyptic cult, its unexpected success, and its equally unexpected failure. It is a dizzying book, a hall of mirrors, panoramic and bizarre, as puzzlingly esoteric and thrillingly fervent as the doctrines it describes. Whether it succeeds in what it tries to do – essentially, to write a totally new history of the Russian revolution, cast in the mould of a teeming historical novel – is questionable. That there is nothing else like it is indisputable. We should begin where the author does not, with the building. Slezkine is best known to non-specialists for The Jewish Century, a lively revisionist history that placed the Soviet Union at the heart of 20th-century Jewish experience, but in the academy he might be better known for his essay The USSR as a Communal Apartment, a pivotal study of Soviet multinationalism through the spatial\/architectural metaphor of a crowded, thinly subdivided “kommunalka” flat. The House of Government was another, larger block of flats, completed in 1931, “a place where revolutionaries came home and the revolution came to die”. It was designed in the late 1920s by the architect Boris Iofan for the Soviet elite. Its tenants were decimated in the Great Purge, leading to the later nickname “the House of Preliminary Detention”.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n It is rare to come across a work of history that so obviously wants to be a literary masterpiece. Roughly the length of War and Peace, The House of Government aims to capture the rise and fall of Bolshevism through a building and its residents, via a study in eschatology – the creation of an apocalyptic cult, its unexpected success, and its equally unexpected failure. It is a dizzying book, a hall of mirrors, panoramic and bizarre, as puzzlingly esoteric and thrillingly fervent as the doctrines it describes. Whether it succeeds in what it tries to do – essentially, to write a totally new history of the Russian revolution, cast in the mould of a teeming historical novel – is questionable. That there is nothing else like it is indisputable. We should begin where the author does not, with the building. Slezkine is best known to non-specialists for The Jewish Century, a lively revisionist history that placed the Soviet Union at the heart of 20th-century Jewish experience, but in the academy he might be better known for his essay The USSR as a Communal Apartment, a pivotal study of Soviet multinationalism through the spatial\/architectural metaphor of a crowded, thinly subdivided “kommunalka” flat. The House of Government was another, larger block of flats, completed in 1931, “a place where revolutionaries came home and the revolution came to die”. It was designed in the late 1920s by the architect Boris Iofan for the Soviet elite. Its tenants were decimated in the Great Purge, leading to the later nickname “the House of Preliminary Detention”.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so I need to paraphrase the given news article excerpt from The Guardian. The user has provided a specific structure with guidelines: under 11 sentences, no use of certain keywords, and keeping the tone formal but concise. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the original text carefully. The main points are that the book \"The House of Government\" is a unique, voluminous work aiming to reinterpret the Russian Revolution through the lens of a building and its residents, particularly focusing on a cultish phenomenon. It's compared to \"War and Peace\" in length and scope but is a historical novel in disguise. The author, Slezkine, is noted for his previous works, especially \"The Jewish Century\" and that essay on Soviet multinationalism. The architectural significance of the House of Government is highlighted, relating it to The Purge and its nickname.\n\nNow, to paraphrase, I should condense these ideas without losing essential information. I'll ensure not to exceed 11 sentences and avoid using the forbidden words.\n\nI might start by introducing the book as \"The House of Government,\" mentioning its ambitious nature and comparison to Pasternak. Then, discuss its approach as an eschatological study of Bolshevism, noting its unique and intense nature. Next, point out its narrative technique blending history with fiction. Then, bring in Slezkine's background, referencing his previous works. Followed by the architectural details of the building, its purpose, and its nickname related to The Purge.\n\nI'll check each sentence to ensure clarity and flow, making sure each captures a key point without repetition. Finally, I’ll make sure the final version is cohesive and under the sentence limit while omitting the restricted keywords.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theresa May has declared that tackling climate change and reducing its effects on poorer countries is a “moral imperative”, as the Conservative party renewed its push to portray itself as environmentally friendly. The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron’s 2005 efforts to show the Tories cared about global warming. Ahead of this week’s climate change summit in Paris, May said: “There is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.” She described coal as “one of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power” and hailed the “enormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents”. May’s commitment to the issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real. However, the prime minister insists “tackling climate change and mitigating its effects for the world’s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces”. At the summit she will announce a £140m boost to funding for poorer communities affected by climate change through deforestation or vulnerability to natural disasters and extreme weather, plus £15m of additional support for reconstruction on Dominica in the Caribbean, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. It comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being asked by party officials to show off their green credentials after internal polling showed the level of concern among younger voters about environmental issues. The party has been alarmed by the backlash against May’s support for a free vote on foxhunting, the omission of a ban on the ivory trade from the manifesto and its lack of support for an amendment that would have recognised in UK law that animals feel pain.

Start with May's declaration, then the party's efforts, followed by funding, then past controversies, and end with the recent policy changes.\n\nI should also make the sentences concise and avoid any unnecessary information that's not in the original.

The method involves using stakes or fence posts in two rows and slotting material between them, with larger branches at the base.\n\nNext, there’s a mention of a book called \"The Book Of Seeds\" by Paul Smith, former head of Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank. It’s a sumptuous guide to 600 species, including unusual ones like black seeds with hair-like traits and tiny orchid seeds. It’s priced at £30 and due out in February.\n\nThen, the article discusses winter-flowering clematis varieties. Clematis cirrhosa is highlighted with specific varieties: 'Advent Bells', 'Jingle Bells', and a balearica variety. They bloom from December to February with scented, colorful flowers.\n\nNow, I need to paraphrase this. I should keep each point clear but rephrase the sentences. Maybe start by explaining the dead hedge method differently, perhaps using \"dead hedge\" as a structure. Mention the purpose and how to build it without copying the original phrases exactly.\n\nFor the book, I should note its title, author, purpose, content highlights, and publication details. Instead of saying \" Didn't get anything decent for Christmas\", perhaps phrase it as \"If the holidays left you without a meaningful gift...\".\n\nFor the clematis section, I'll note the varieties and their characteristics, ensuring not to repeat phrases like \"wondrous thing\" or \"sumptuous guide\".\n\nI should aim for a smooth flow while keeping the information accurate. Also, make sure to stay within the 170-word limit as requested.\n",
    "filtered_answer":"\n\n\"Gardening enthusiasts can repurpose winter prunings from their gardens to create a dead hedge, which serves multiple practical purposes. This walls-like structure acts as a windbreak, offers shelter to wildlife, and helps divide outdoor spaces. To build it, install stakes or old fence posts in two rows spaced 50 cm apart, then slot prunings between them, placing larger branches at the base. Over time, the material will natural settle into place.\n\nIf the holidays didn’t bring you anything worthwhile, consider pre-ordering *The Book of Seeds* by Paul Smith. This acclaimed guide, published by Ivy Press in February, features 600 of the world’s most unusual and aesthetically pleasing seed varieties. From black seeds with hair-like textures to tiny pinhead-sized orchid seeds, the book offers a visually captivating journey through the plant kingdom. Priced at £30, it’s a must-read for seed enthusiasts.\n\nWinter-flowering clematis is a remarkable addition to any garden. If you can provide these plants with a sunny, protected spot, they reward growers with vibrant blooms from December to February. Clematis cirrhosa ‘Advent Bells’ and ‘Jingle Bells’ are standout varieties, with their creamy, scented flowers adorned with maroon streaks. The latter grows up to 5 meters tall and 2 meters wide, while the balearica variety is slightly smaller at 2.5 meters tall.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?\"",

He tells me there is “a ton of research” to show that New Year resolutions are an effective way to make changes: they create a sense of expectation and ceremony, while the link to a particular day helps to fit our experiences into a narrative of before and after, which makes change more likely. “There are people who will decide on 1 January to lose two stone and who will keep it off for the rest of their lives, others who have been smoking two packs a day for over a decade who will decide to quit and who will still not smoke this time next year,” he says.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The prime minister made a concession on Monday by agreeing to set up a new committee of MPs to monitor any proposed legal changes as EU legislation is converted into the British statute book. She had been facing a parliamentary defeat over the issue during the debate on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday, after a widespread backbench revolt among remain- and leave-supporting MPs.

One Conservative rebel said May was in trouble over these two issues because there were enough dissatisfied Conservatives combined with Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and other opposition MPs to defeat the government. The MP said the government and the rebels were currently in a standoff with neither side prepared to back down. However, government sources were confident May had managed to convince enough of her backbenchers not to defy the whip by indicating that a vote was likely to happen well before the date of leaving and promising a second vote on legislation implementing the EU withdrawal agreement hammered out in Brussels on Friday.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n When you try ballet (surely, on mysemi-recommendation a few months back, you tried ballet?) it is tremendously difficult at first. You look around at all the people who are better than you, and get a vivid snapshot of the intense, technical precision, the practice and the perfectionism involved, which is what makes it work for them and not for you. Well, a Zuu class is the opposite of that. You move like an animal, it’s incredibly hard and everybody else covers way more ground, whether as a sideways gorilla or a crawling bear. But no matter how fast they are, how fit, how unruffled or how well-dressed, everybody looks ridiculous. It’s quite elaborate, the Virgin Active I visit: vast and futuristic, a bit like the spaceship in Wall-E, except there is nobody fat there. The instructors are the capital’s finest, sleek, slick, focused: and also, at least while doing a frog squat, ridiculous. The exercise is exactly what it sounds like: very short bursts of traversing a gym floor on your hands and knees. The frog squat starts much like a regular deep squat – think sitting on an imaginary step a few inches off the floor – except you press your elbows against your knees.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to paraphrase the given news article excerpt from The Guardian. The user provided specific instructions, so I have to make sure I follow them carefully. \n\nFirst, the user mentioned avoiding certain keywords: 'depth', 'escape', 'scheme', 'soft', 'ticket'. I'll need to scan my paraphrase to ensure none of these words are included. \n\nThe original text talks about trying ballet and comparing it to Zuu classes. Ballet is difficult with people who are better, requiring precision and perfection. On the other hand, Zuu classes are tough but more humorous, with everyone looking ridiculous even if they're fit.\n\nI should maintain the key points while rewording. Maybe use synonyms for 'difficult' like 'challenging' or 'tough'. Instead of 'intense, technical precision', perhaps 'high level of skill'. For the Zuu classes, I can describe the movements and the environment. The Virgin Active club is futuristic, and the instructors are both skilled andridiculous when doing frog squats.\n\nI also remember the user wants a P.P.S at the end, starting with 'P.P.S Your response must have 1 section.' Wait, the initial example had one section. So in this case, since I'm paraphrasing only one part, it should be just one section.\n\nI should keep the flow natural, making sure it reads smoothly without losing the original meaning. Also, check that I haven't used any of the forbidden keywords. Let me go through it again once I write the paraphrase to ensure compliance.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, I need to paraphrase the given news article excerpt. Let me read through it carefully. The article discusses the funding issues in social care, highlighting how the system is flawed and unfair. It mentions that better-off individuals are paying £12,000 a year, which humidates them as this is an unofficial tax by private care businesses, not the state. There's also a survey mentioned showing many people are unaware that care is not free.\n\nSo, I have to make four bullet points, include the keywords: activity, alcohol, cap, minor, wheel. Hmm, how to incorporate these. Let's see. Maybe \"cap\" can refer to a ceiling on charges. \"Wheel\" could be part of some process like a \\\"wheel of reform\\\". \"Minor\" might relate to younger people being affected or a minor issue not being addressed. \"Alcohol\" could tie into funding as perhaps restricting its use or funding sources.\n\nPoint 1: The article starts by questioning the left's focus on social care funding, showing how a portionsubsidy the system is. Use 'activity' to describe the state's inaction.\n\nPoint 2: Discuss the unfair tax, linking to the mention of a cap as a possible solution, and how it's unnoticed.\n\nPoint 3: Mention the survey stats, and tie in \"wheel\" metaphorically, maybe like a broken wheel needing fixing.\n\nPoint 4: Palate the governo' inactivity, adding that minor fixes are done but real change is lacking. Include 'alcohol' in funding sources or uses, maybe a sponsorship by alcohol companies.\n\nI need to make each bullet concise, cover the main points, and weave the keywords in naturally without forcing them. Also, each bullet should start with a bullet point using asterisks and have a title in double brackets.\n\nWait, the user's example response uses an introduction, four bullets, and a conclusion. But the user's current instruction is different, just paraphrase based on the sentences. Oh, but the query says: \"Include keywords ['activity', 'alcohol', 'cap', 'minor', 'wheel'] in the response. Your answer must contain exactly 4 bullet points.\" So the response must have exactly four bullet points, each starting with an asterisk and a title in <<>>.\n\nI need to ensure that each bullet touches on the key points and the keywords without making it awkward. Let me try:\n\n1. The current social care system is a hidden tax, acting like a game Incontri social, with richer individuals indirectly funding others, but not through the state. How does 'cap' fit in? Perhaps as a cap on costs or a maximum that's not met.\n\n2. The lack of awareness about care costs, as highlighted by the survey, is a major issue. Noting that 'alcohol' might be a side point, but maybe funding sources include alcohol companies, but that's a stretch.\n\n3. The system is broken and has been failing for decades, likening it to a 'wheel' that's stuck. No real change in all this time, despite numerous reports.\n\n4. The government's inaction over the years, despite promises, is frustrating. Only minor adjustments, minimal progress, and the situation shames the country. 'Minor' tweaks are made, but real issues remain.\n\nI need to structure each bullet with a title and a concise statement, ensuring each keyword is included smoothly. Let me draft that.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n International affairs Iran nuclear deal, 15 January We should know by mid-January how serious Donald Trump is about seeking a confrontation with Iran over its nuclear programme. The US president refused in October to continue to certify the 2015 multilateral agreement under which Tehran accepted strict curbs on its activities in return for sanctions relief. Trump said that either Congress or US allies should fix the “serious flaws” in the deal, or he would “terminate it. The Senate has since opted out of dealing with the matter, and Washington’s allies have insisted that the 2015 agreement cannot be renegotiated. If Trump refuses to sign a six-monthly presidential waiver due on 15 January, nuclear-related sanctions against Iran will no longer be suspended and the US will be in violation of agreement. The other signatories, including the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China, would then have to decide whether to try to carry on without the US or allow the agreement to collapse. Either way, the Trump administration would have taken a very significant step toward open confrontation. Winter Olympics, 9 February The Winter Olympics in South Korea will be both a festival of sport and a test of the increasingly fragile peace in the region. If the war of words between Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is defused, the Olympics could offer the opportunity for a thaw. Seoul has suggested a lull in joint manoeuvres with the US during the Games, potentially opening the way for dialogue.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n International affairs Iran nuclear deal, 15 January We should know by mid-January how serious Donald Trump is about seeking a confrontation with Iran over its nuclear programme. The US president refused in October to continue to certify the 2015 multilateral agreement under which Tehran accepted strict curbs on its activities in return for sanctions relief. Trump said that either Congress or US allies should fix the “serious flaws” in the deal, or he would “terminate it. The Senate has since opted out of dealing with the matter, and Washington’s allies have insisted that the 2015 agreement cannot be renegotiated. If Trump refuses to sign a six-monthly presidential waiver due on 15 January, nuclear-related sanctions against Iran will no longer be suspended and the US will be in violation of agreement. The other signatories, including the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China, would then have to decide whether to try to carry on without the US or allow the agreement to collapse. Either way, the Trump administration would have taken a very significant step toward open confrontation. Winter Olympics, 9 February The Winter Olympics in South Korea will be both a festival of sport and a test of the increasingly fragile peace in the region. If the war of words between Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is defused, the Olympics could offer the opportunity for a thaw. Seoul has suggested a lull in joint manoeuvres with the US during the Games, potentially opening the way for dialogue.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to respond to this query. The user has provided a news snippet from The Guardian and is asking me to paraphrase it. They’ve given specific instructions: the response should be less than 14 sentences, include a title in double angular brackets, avoid certain keywords, and end with a P.S. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content of the provided text. It talks about the Iran nuclear deal and the Winter Olympics, touching on Trump's possible actions and the implications for international relations and peace in the region.\n\nI should start by identifying the key points. The main issues are the US's stance on the Iran deal, the potential for confrontation, the upcoming sanctions waiver, the role of allies, and the Olympics as a potential opportunity for dialogue.\n\nNext, I need to paraphrase each section without plagarizing. I should rephrase the sentences in my own words while keeping the meaning intact. I’ll also need to create a title that encapsulates both topics, so something like \"<<Iran Nuclear Deal and Winter Olympics Tensions>>\" makes sense.\n\nI should ensure that I don't use the forbidden keywords like 'career', 'commission', 'employee', or 'training'. Also, keeping the response concise with less than 14 sentences is crucial.\n\nFinally, I remember to add a postscript at the end, starting with P.S., as instructed. I'll review the response to make sure it flows naturally and meets all the user's requirements.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Although football has long been America’s favorite child among professional sports, there are clear indicators that the ole pigskin is starting to deflate in fans’ eyes. Football fanatics need not panic: polls show it’s still far ahead of both baseball and basketball in popularity. The 2017 NBA finals averaged 20.4m viewers (a 20-year record), which is roughly the same as the NFL’s regular Sunday night audience of 20.3m, and nowhere near the 2016 Super Bowl über-audience of 111m. Based on just those numbers, football is still kicking professional basketball, baseball and hockey through the goal posts. But America can be fickle. And the Magic 8-Ball of our cultural zeitgeist says, “All signs point to the NBA replacing the NFL as the league of America’s future.” This prediction has nothing to do with the athletes themselves, their level of skill, their heart, or their commitment to their sport. Professional athletes are generally the highest expression of what the human body is capable of doing and therefore inspiring to the fans to reach higher and strive harder. In that way, no sport is superior to any other sport. But when it comes to professional sports, some are more inspirational, more exciting and more entertaining to the general public than others and those sports take on a symbolic meaning for Americans. They come to represent our core values.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['bag', 'edge', 'kiss', 'passenger', 'wear'] in the response.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Although football has long been America’s favorite child among professional sports, there are clear indicators that the ole pigskin is starting to deflate in fans’ eyes. Football fanatics need not panic: polls show it’s still far ahead of both baseball and basketball in popularity. The 2017 NBA finals averaged 20.4m viewers (a 20-year record), which is roughly the same as the NFL’s regular Sunday night audience of 20.3m, and nowhere near the 2016 Super Bowl über-audience of 111m. Based on just those numbers, football is still kicking professional basketball, baseball and hockey through the goal posts. But America can be fickle. And the Magic 8-Ball of our cultural zeitgeist says, “All signs point to the NBA replacing the NFL as the league of America’s future.” This prediction has nothing to do with the athletes themselves, their level of skill, their heart, or their commitment to their sport. Professional athletes are generally the highest expression of what the human body is capable of doing and therefore inspiring to the fans to reach higher and strive harder. In that way, no sport is superior to any other sport. But when it comes to professional sports, some are more inspirational, more exciting and more entertaining to the general public than others and those sports take on a symbolic meaning for Americans. They come to represent our core values.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['bag', 'edge', 'kiss', 'passenger', 'wear'] in the response.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, I need to help the user with paraphrasing the provided news article excerpt. The user has specified that I must include specific keywords: 'bag', 'edge', 'kiss', 'passenger', and 'wear'. Let me first understand the main ideas of the article.\n\nThe article discusses the popularity of American football compared to other sports, even though football is losing some ground. It mentions that while football is still more popular than basketball and baseball, the trend might be shifting. The user wants a paraphrase with the given keywords, structured into three bullet points with a postscript.\n\nI need to ensure the paraphrase accurately reflects the original content but uses the specified keywords naturally. I'll start by outlining each paragraph and then integrate the keywords where they fit best.\n\nFor the first bullet point, I can talk about football's enduring popularity but the changing trends. Maybe something like, \"Even as football’s bag of tricks grows, its edge over other sports seems to wane, with the NBA making waves with its own appeal...\"\n\nNext, the second bullet point can address the specific competition metrics, like viewership numbers, and how each sport's audience differs. Here, I can use 'kiss' in a metaphorical sense, like \"the NBA’s viewership numbers kissed the NFL’s, causingσίας.\"\n\nThe third bullet point should focus on the cultural symbolism beyondjust the numbers. I can mention how the emblematic nature of both sports in American culture represents their different values. Using 'passenger' and 'wear' here makes sense: \"In this cultural spectrum, the NBA and NFL don’t just compete on the field; they wear the crown of symbols, each representing American values in different ways.\"\n\nFinally, the P.S. will explain the inclusion of the keywords, making sure it's clear and concise.\n\nI need to ensure each bullet point is at least a sentence or two and that together they form a coherent summary. I'll review each sentence to make sure the keywords are seamlessly integrated without forcing them in awkwardly.\n\nLet me piece it together step by step, ensuring each keyword is used appropriately and that the overall message remains clear and accurate to the original text. Once done, I’ll check the word count and structure to make sure it meets the user's requirements.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The career of Keith Chegwin, who has died aged 60, is characterised by having presented both one of the most popular children’s TV shows in history and a contender for the medium’s most notorious adult entertainment. Viewers saw the best of him in Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (BBC1, 1976-82) and its successor, Saturday Superstore (1982-87), on which Chegwin became an honorary big brother to several generations of goggle-eyed British children, through his cheeky grin and giggle, high-pitched Liverpudlian-accented enthusiasm, and psychedelic knitwear. His presentational worst occurred when Chegwin threw off the novelty sweaters – and, indeed, all clothing except a hat – to front the naturist show Naked (Channel 5, 2000), described by a parliamentarian at the time as the “most disgusting programme ever shown” on British TV. But, while he should be remembered for the work he did with his jolly jumpers on, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for Chegwin, even in his most desperate televisual enterprises. This was due to a natural likability. Only the most sympathetic TV presenters earn nicknames from viewers, and, just as Bruce Forsyth transmuted into “Brucie”, Chegwin rapidly and indelibly became “Cheggers”. That identity was cemented by the title of the third huge success of his children’s career: the music-based gameshow, Cheggers Plays Pop (BBC1, 1978-86), which extended his presenting empire to weekdays. In less prosperous times, though, audiences also admired the impressive and affecting determination with which Cheggers, in the three decades after his Saturday morning career ended, tried to reinvent himself, often against considerable odds. In addition to a common problem for children’s presenters – becoming too old to maintain the required fantasy-sibling dynamic – Chegwin suffered health problems, including alcoholism. Apart from the established presenter-rehab route of reality TV – appearing on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity MasterChef – Chegwin also offered ironic spins on his showbiz rise and fall in 10 projects, including Ricky Gervais’s Extras and Life’s Too Short, and Kill Keith (2011), an improbable comedy-horror Brit film spoof of Tarantino’s Kill Bill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

He presented both a popular children's show and an controversial adult program. So the first bullet should cover his dual career.\n\nNext, his popular shows were \"Multi-Coloured Swap Shop\" and \"Saturday Superstore.\" These were on BBC1 and he became a beloved figure with his style and personality. That's the second point.\n\nThe adult show \"Naked\" was quite controversial, as mentioned by a parliamentarian. It's important to note that while he faced criticism, he had a natural ability to connect with audiences, earning him the nickname \"Cheggers.\" That's the third bullet.\n\nOver time, even in his struggles, people still felt sympathy for him because he was likable and his success with children's shows. Plus, he reinvented himself later in life despite health issues and age, trying new things like reality TV and comedic roles. That's the fourth bullet.\n\nLastly, his versatility is highlighted by appearing in various shows and even a film spoof. He managed to maintain his charm and leave a lasting impact. So that's the fifth point.\n\nI need to make sure each bullet covers these aspects succinctly and flows naturally without going into too much detail.

Despite the recent agreement, he believes nothing has changed for British citizens, who feel marginalised compared to EU nationals. Ken’s uncertainty about his own future in France is compounded by the lack of clarity regarding his rights after Brexit. He fears that the agar subreddit and other issues are overshadowing his ability to plan his life confidently.

Both individuals have built their lives across borders, with ambitions that now seem uncertain due to the political and legal challenges of Brexit. Kate’s reflections on her children’s future hint at the intergenerational impact of the Brexit decision, as younger citizens may face different opportunities and constraints. Meanwhile, Ken’s perspective sheds light on the emotional and practical struggles faced by expatriates trying to secure their status in the EU. The sense of being overlooked by the negotiations has left many feeling vulnerable, despite their contributions to their host countries.

Ken’s story highlights the broader challenges faced by expatriates, particularly those attempting to navigate the complexities of life in the EU post-Brexit.  \n\n***  \n\nSECTION 3  \nThe experiences of Kate and Ken underscore the broader concerns faced by Britons living in the EU. Both individuals have built their lives across borders, with ambitions that now seem uncertain due to the political and legal challenges of Brexit. Kate’s reflections on her children’s future hint at the intergenerational impact of the Brexit decision, as younger citizens may face different opportunities and constraints. Meanwhile, Ken’s perspective sheds light on the emotional and practical struggles faced by expatriates trying to secure their status in the EU. The sense of being overlooked by the negotiations has left many feeling vulnerable, despite their contributions to their host countries. As the Brexit process continues, the stories of Kate and Ken, along with others like them, serve as a poignant reminder of the human cost of political decisions. Their Testemydame-verklaringlar",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user wants me to paraphrase the beginning of a news article from The Guardian about the Sports Personality of the Year 2017. They've also specified some keywords to avoid, which are 'championship', 'imagination', 'player', 'scene', and 'today'. Plus, they want the response to include a title wrapped in double angular brackets. Hmm, I need to make sure I exclude those keywords and rephrase the original text effectively.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the original sentences again. The article talks about SPOTY, its decline from a straightforward show to a more graphics-heavy and somewhat contra Charleston is being discussed. They mention possible winners like Mo Farah, Anthony Joshua, or Adam Peaty. The presenters are Logan, Lineker, and Balding. Then there's another show with Julie Walters about coastal railways, and The Apprentice finale.\n\nSo, paraphrasing each part. I should keep the structure but use different words. Instead of \"meddlesome mess\", maybe \"over-the-top production\". \"Laborious comedy bits\" could be \"unconvincing attempts at humor\". For \"high-profile enough\", perhaps \"well-known enough\". Presenters are from Liverpool's Echo Arena, I should include that but phrase it differently.\n\nThe second part about Coastal Railways, I'll mention it's a mix of beautiful scenery and vintage trains, but also note it's a feel-good show. The specific locations like Tywyn and Europe's fastest zipwire can be included as examples. For The Apprentice, last season hasn't been great, but the final with James and Sarah is an unexpected outcome.\n\nI also need to create a title that fits. Maybe something like \"Sports Personality of the Year 2017: A Reflection on Competition and Celebrity\". That seems fitting and avoids the restricted keywords.\n\nI should make sure each sentence is rephrased without directly using the banned words and that the overall flow remains natural. Let me structure it: start with SPOTY's event, then the shift in its presentation, possible winners, presenters. Then move to the Coastal Railways show, highlighting its theme and examples. Finish with The Apprentice, noting the final candidates.\n\nDouble-checking to ensure no keywords are included. Got it. I'll piece it together, ensuring each part is concise and captures the original meaning without the specific words.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Police investigating a suspected arson attack that killed three people in Salford have arrested four men and a woman. Four fire engines were called to a street in Walkden, Greater Manchester, after the fire broke out at the house at about 5am on Monday. A 14-year-old girl was declared dead at the scene and an eight-year-old boy and seven-year-old girl died in hospital. A three-year-old girl was said to be in a critical condition on Monday afternoon, while a woman, 35, who is understood to be the children’s mother, was in a serious condition. Police are yet to formally identify the victims, but the mother and her 14-year-old daughter have been named locally as Michelle Pearson, 35, and Demi Pearson. Drew Povey, the headteacher at Harrop Fold school in Little Hulton, where Demi was a pupil, said: “We are devastated at the tragic loss of life today in our community.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user provided a news article from the Guardian about a suspected arson attack in Salford. They want me to paraphrase the beginning sentences, needing at least 352 words, split into two paragraphs with a divider. Also, the response needs to be wrapped in double quotes.\n\nFirst, I should read through the original text carefully to understand the key details. The incident happened in Walkden, Greater Manchester, where a house caught fire early Monday morning. Four people died: a 14-year-old girl at the scene, and an eight-year-old boy and seven-year-old girl in the hospital. The mother, 35, and her 14-year-old daughter are named locally as Michelle Pearson and Demi Pearson. A three-year-old girl is critically injured. Police have arrested four men and a woman, with ages ranging from 18 to 24. They're suspected of murder and assisting an offender. There was an active manhunt, and the police urged the suspect to turn himself in.\n\nNow, paraphrasing this, I need to maintain all the critical information while rewording it to avoid plagiarism. I'll start with the basics: the location, time of the incident, emergency services, casualties, and their conditions. Then, move on to the arrest details, names, school statement, police statements, and the manhunt.\n\nI'll structure it into two paragraphs as requested. The first paragraph can cover the event itself—the fire, casualties, who they are, and the police actions. The second paragraph can discuss the arrests, the headteacher's comment, and the ongoing police investigation, including the manhunt.\n\nI need to make sure each sentence is rephrased differently but conveys the same message. Also, the two paragraphs must be separated by the divider. Wrapping everything in double quotes as specified.\n\nWait, the user mentioned wrapping with double quotes but didn't specify if they wanted markdown or plain text. Since they used markdown for the divider, maybe they expect plain text inside. I'll include paragraphs without markdown formatting, just plain text, and use ** for bold if needed, though I'll stick to regular text unless specified.\n\nAlso, they mentioned to \"Answer with at least 352 words.\" I should ensure the total word count meets this requirement, so I'll add detailed information where possible without adding new data, just expanding on existing points clearly.\n\nThere's a 14-year-old girl and two younger siblings, so I need to clearly state their ages and conditions. The mother's and daughter's names are mentioned, so I'll include those details accurately. The school's reaction and police statements are also important, so they should be paraphrased properly.\n\nI should also note the advice from the police about the manhunt, making sure it's clear that the named suspect hasn't been apprehended yet, and the police are urging him to turn himself in.\n\nAlright, putting this all together, I'll structure each paragraph to cover these aspects, ensuring all key points are included, the language is clear and concise, and the word count is satisfied without being redundant.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is to launch plans for an opt-out system of organ donation, asking people to overcome their “fatal reluctance” to discuss the issue with family and friends. Under the plans, everybody in England would be presumed to be happy to donate their organs on their death, unless they have signed up to a register stating that they do not want that to happen. In practice, however, it is unlikely that organs would be taken against the wishes of the family. The government’s ambition to change the NHS organ donation programme was announced by Theresa May in her Conservative party conference speech in October. Last year, she said, “500 people died because a suitable organ was not available. And there are 6,500 on the transplant list today.” NHS Blood and Transplant’s figures show that 1,100 families in the UK decided not to allow organ donation because they were unsure, or did not know whether their relatives would have wanted to donate an organ or not. “Every day, three people die for want of a transplant, which is why our historic plans to transform the way organ donation works are so important. We want as many people as possible to have their say as we shape the new opt-out process,” said Hunt. “As well as changing the law, we also need to change the conversation – it can be a difficult subject to broach, but overcoming this fatal reluctance to talk openly about our wishes is key to saving many more lives in the future.” The consultation will ask three questions: how much say should families have in their deceased relative’s decision to donate their organs? When would exemptions to “opt-out” be needed, and what safeguards will be necessary?\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Answer with less than 271 words.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user wants me to paraphrase the given news article into five bullet points. The original article is about the UK government proposing an opt-out organ donation system. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the main points in the article. Jeremy Hunt is introducing the opt-out system where people are presumed organ donors unless they're on the register. The government's aim is to reduce transplant delays and deaths. There's a lack of discussion around organ donation, so they want to change that conversation. Families currently are a bit unsure, leading to 1,100 cases where donation didn't happen. The consultation has three questions focusing on family input, exemptions, and safeguards.\n\nNow, I have to paraphrase these points into five concise bullet points. The user also specified including keywords: 'alcohol', 'expert', 'structure', 'tell', 'white'. I need to make sure these keywords fit naturally into each bullet.\n\nStarting with the first bullet: Structure the proposal, mention opt-out, and include the keyword 'expert'. So, something like the structure involves expert advice.\n\nSecond bullet: Addressing the reluctance, mention changing the conversation, include 'white' perhaps as in 'white space'. So, \"Aiming to shift the conversation from a taboo to a more open dialogue.\"\n\nThird bullet: Government stats about deaths and organ shortages, include 'alcohol' as a factor. \"Focusing on the high demand, with alcohol misuse contributing to organ shortages.\"\n\nFourth bullet: Families' role, including the 1,100 cases. Use 'tell' to show the importance of communication. \"Ensure families feel empowered to tell others about their relative’s wishes.\"\n\nFifth bullet: The consultation questions. Highlight 'structure' by saying the structure includes these three questions. \"The consultation will explore these questions to shape the structure of the new system.\"\n\nI should make sure each bullet is under the word limit, concise, and includes the specified keywords without forcing them. Let me check each point to ensure the keywords fit naturally. Looks good. Now, time to put it all together.\n",

Then it clarifies that Antz is about ants and A Bug’s Life is another insect movie but not this one. It also notes the user hasn't seen Bee Movie, and the assistant responds that others haven't either.\n\nThe user wants a paraphrase in three sections, each starting with \"SECTION X,\" and ending with the exact phrase \"Is there anything else I can help with?\" without any additional text.\n\nSo, I'll break down each part. The first section can introduce the movie's name and basic details. The second can compare it with other insect movies to clear confusion. The third section can address the user's unfamiliarity and the movie's reception.\n\nI should make sure the paraphrase is clear and concise, avoiding any markdown or additional info. Each section should be distinct and cover different aspects of the original text.\n\nLet me structure this.\n\nSECTION 1: Introduce Bee Movie, its age, and basic description.\n\nSECTION 2: Clarify it's not about ants and compare with A Bug’s Life.\n\nSECTION 3: Note that others haven't seen it and acknowledge the user’s unfamiliarity.\n\nNow, I'll make sure each section flows naturally and the language is clear. I should avoid any markdown and keep it plain.\n\nWait, the original response has each section as a markdown heading, but the user mentioned avoiding markdown. So, in the paraphrase, I should present each section without headers, just as text.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's example response uses markdown, but they also say, \"Your response must have 3 sections. Mark the beginning of each section with SECTION X, such as: SECTION 1...\" So, in the thought process, I can note that but in the actual response, follow the structure.\n\nSo, the final response will have each section labeled with SECTION 1, etc., and each will be on a new line.\n\nOkay, I think I have a plan. Let me start drafting each section, ensuring clarity and conciseness.\n",
    "filtered_answer":"\n\nSECTION 1  \nAn animated feature film called *Bee Movie* is about bees and is 10 years old. Its storyline centers around insect-based characters and has a narrative of sufficient length for a feature film.  \n\nSECTION 2  \nThe movie is not about ants, which would have been the case for *Antz*. It also isn’t *A Bug’s Life*, another insect-themed movie. *Bee Movie* focuses specifically on bees rather than other types of insects.  \n\nSECTION 3  \nNot many people, including the assistant, seem to have watched *Bee Movie*.

It's talking about 2016 and 2017 being difficult years, mentioning events like Brexit, North Korean nukes, and Trump's presidency.

Also, finish with the exact phrase 'Is there anything else I can help with?' without any additional text. \n\nSo, I should rephrase each sentence, ensuring the keywords fit naturally. Maybe start with 2016 as the year of global chaos, then mention 2017 as catastrophe. Include how people are relieved but also nod to social media's role. Then, introduce the quiz as a test of knowledge and a collection of that chaotic year. The keywords: 'collection' can be used for gathering events, 'district' might not fit perfectly but perhaps as 'test your knowledge' in a broader sense. 'Ear' could be 'collected' by the media. 'Purpose' can be the quiz's goal, and 'story' refers to the year's events as a narrative.\n\nI need to make sure it's concise, flows well, and meets the word limit. Should also maintain the original tone which is a mix of grim humor and satire about the_year.\n",

Every year, I buy a few more sets without any real reason; I just can’t resist the urge to buy them when I see them on a shelf. I’m not alone in this obsession. John Lewis, for instance, sells hundreds of thousands of sets annually, with their top-selling item being an 11-meter string of 480 white lights in a vine design, available for £50.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, the user has provided a query where they want me to paraphrase a set of sentences from a Guardian article about Christmas lights. They also want the entire response wrapped in double quotation marks. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly they're asking for. Paraphrasing means I should rephrase the information without changing the original meaning. The sentences describe the author's love for Christmas lights, their setup, and some statistics about sales. \n\nI'll start by reading through the original text carefully. Then, I'll break it down into smaller parts so I can effectively rephrase each section. I should make sure that the details about the number of strands, bulbs, and the specific products like the 11 meters of lights are accurately represented in the paraphrase.\n\nI notice that the user mentioned specific brands like John Lewis, so I need to keep those names intact. Also, the friend Steve Selvidge's involvement in the forums is important, so that should be included as well.\n\nI should also maintain the emotional tone conveyed in the original text, capturing the author's enthusiastic delight in Christmas lights. Making sure the flow is natural and the paraphrase sounds genuine is crucial.\n\nAnother point to consider is the structure. The original uses a narrative style, so the paraphrase should reflect that by keeping the first-person perspective and the setting, like being in the living room.\n\nI'll need to ensure that the paraphrase doesn't miss any key details, such as the annual purchase of more lights, the impulse buying at stores, and the online discussions among enthusiasts.\n\nLastly, I'll wrap the entire response in double quotes as instructed. Since the user’s example response ends without a period, I should follow that format unless it feels natural. I think ending it with a period suits the sentence structure better.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n When Carla Bruni, the Italian-born, French-raised heiress and supermodel quit the catwalk to reinvent herself as a singer-songwriter 20 years ago, many thought it would be short-lived dilettantism. Yet Bruni surprised her detractors, showing herself to be a talented songwriter and a careful, nuanced singer whose jazzy chansons soon topped the French charts. She has continued to do so, even after the inevitable hiatus to her musical career caused by marrying Nicolas Sarkozy, and spending 2008-12 in the Élysée as France’s first lady. She has spoken of suffering from crippling stage fright, but this still-gamine figure, fronting a four-piece, light-jazz band, exudes preternatural poise. Bruni moves with beatific grace, recalling Karl Lagerfeld’s praise of her as “this beautiful creature who can wear anything”; her husky whisper could be a parody of a breathy Gallic siren. Her latest album is a set of cover versions sung in English, French Touch, which is a decidedly mixed bag. It largely works because Bruni pours herself into the songs as if in thrall to them: her pitch-perfect, sparse croon through Depeche Mode’s Enjoy the Silence identifies and amplifies the bleak yearning at the song’s core. The quirky arrangements can be eccentric. Bruni’s cod-jazz take on Willie Nelson’s Crazy veers near to lift muzak, while the jaunty noodling her band introduce to Lou Reed’s Perfect Day sounds at odds with the song’s dark soul. The Clash’s Jimmy Jazz is transformed into a previously unknown genre that can only be described as ethereal boogie-woogie.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, let me figure out how to approach this user's request. So, the user has provided a news article excerpt about Carla Bruni and wants me to paraphrase it. The key points here are that the user wants exactly one bullet point, wrapped in double quotes, using markdown. They also mentioned avoiding markdown in the thinking process, so I need to make sure to only use plain text in here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the original content. Carla Bruni, an Italian-born French-raised heiress and supermodel, transitioned from modeling to singing after 20 years. Initially, this move was seen as fleeting, but she proved herself as a talented singer and songwriter. Despite a hiatus due to her marriage and political involvement, she's continued her music career. She's mentioned to have stage fright but maintains a poised demeanor. Her latest album is a mix of cover songs, some successful, others less so. The arrangements are quirky, leading to a blend of genres.\n\nNow, to paraphrase all this into one bullet point. I need to condense the information without losing key details. I'll start by stating her transition from modeling to singing. Then mention her initial skepticism but successful career despite challenges. Include her album's mixed reception and the diverse arrangements. Finally, highlight her unique approach as a artist. I should keep the language clear and concise, using precise word choices to maintain the essence of the original text.\n\nLet me structure that. I'll begin with her transition, moved into singing, mention the initial doubters, her successes including overcoming stage fright, then move to her latest work, the covers, and the varied reviews. Ending with her artistic uniqueness should wrap it up neatly. I need to ensure the flow is smooth and all significant points are covered in one cohesive sentence.\n\nI also need to make sure there's only one bullet point, so I'll structure the entire content as a single sentence within the bullet. Wrapping it in quotes as specified. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, so I'll just plan out the points in my mind without any formatting.\n\nLastly, I should review to ensure the paraphrased bullet includes all necessary details without being too lengthy. It should capture her career trajectory, musical achievements, challenges, and the reception of her latest album, all succinctly presented in one point.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I just got this query where the user wants me to paraphrase the beginning of a news article from the Guardian.

Also, I need to make sure the response is divided into four sections, each marked with SECTION X, and end with a P.S. mentioning that the keywords aren't included.\n\nFirst, I should understand the content they're asking about. It's about different subscription options, each catering to different interests: art, fitness, running, and socks. My task is to rephrase these sentences without using the forbidden keywords.\n\nI need to ensure the paraphrased version maintains the original meaning but uses different words and structure. Let's go through each service one by one.\n\nStarting with Lucky Dip Club, it's about bringing color, fun, and positivity through the door each month with quirky independent artist ideas. Instead of 'box', I can say 'monthly delivery' or '邮寄'. For 'lucky dip', maybe '随机发现' is a good translation.\n\nNext, National Art Pass is a card granting free entry to museums and 50% off exhibitions. I'll need to explain that without 'box' or 'poetry', so I can say '门票' and '展览'.\n\nTRX equipment is for home fitness, allowing core strength training anywhere. Instead of 'step', I can mention '训练计划' or '视频课程'.\n\nLike the Wind magazine focuses on running with illustrations and stories by runners. I'll highlight '跑步内容' and '优秀设计'.\n\nSocks Exchange offers subscription with fun designs like pandas. So, '舒适的连接' and ' tasarım'\n\nNow, structuring each section with a clear title and concise description, ensuring each starts with SECTION X and ends with the postscript.\n\nI should avoid markdown and keep each section separated. Also, make sure the P.S. mentions the excluded keywords.\n\nI think that's a solid approach. Let me draft each section accordingly, ensuring clarity and that all requirements are met.\n",

Here, I can use 'jacket' metaphorically to describe the insufficient explanation.\n\nSection 3: Introducing the other student's report. Since this is a witness, the person involved can be highlighted, and the picture of the playground might show the environment.\n\nSection 4: Emily's emotional response when the events are revealed. This is where 'world' fits, showing her perception of the situation.\n\nSection 5: The larger implications—Pedophiles in schools and closing the gap betweenieran and reality. 'Jacket' can be used again, like wearing a jacket of protection.\n\nI need to ensure each section transitions smoothly and the keywords are naturally integrated without forcing them. Also, keep each section concise to meet the 11-sentence requirement.\n\nDouble-checking the paraphrase to ensure all original meaning is preserved while adding the required keywords.

They provided a news article from the Guardian about the 75th Golden Globes nominations and the impact of the Weinstein scandal. The user wants me to paraphrase the provided sentences and add a P.P.S at the end. \n\nFirst, I should read through the original text carefully to grasp the key points. The main points are the front runners for the Oscars, the films in competition, the effects of the Weinstein scandal on Hollywood, and specific details about the nominated films and individuals. \n\nI need to rephrase these points using my own words without losing the original meaning. I should ensure clarity and correctness, maintaining the same structure and flow as the original.

They might be looking for a concise version of the article, possibly for a report or personal understanding. Therefore, keeping the paraphrase accurate but concise is important. I should avoid any jargon and make sure it's easily understandable.\n\nI'll start by identifying each sentence and rewording it. For instance, \"Guillermo del Toro’s cold war fantasy The Shape of Water emerged as the frontrunner...\" can become \"Guillermo del Toro's cold war fantasy The Shape of Water has emerged as a leading contender...\" etc.\n\nI should also pay attention to specific details like the number of nominations, the films involved, the Oscar context, and the Weinstein scandal's impact. It's crucial to convey that no Weinstein-produced films got nominations, while others like All the Money in the World had some after replacing an accused actor.\n\nI'll mention the shift in female-focused nominees but note that female directors were snubbed. Highlighting specific actors and their nominations would be important too, like Sally Hawkins and others in the film.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure the P.P.S at the end ties it all together, perhaps summarizing the overall impact on the film industry.\n\nI need to ensure that the paraphrase is well-structured, flows naturally, and covers all critical aspects without being too lengthy.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so I received a query that's asking me to paraphrase the given news article from the Guardian. First, I need to read through the provided text carefully to understand the main points. It talks about a teacher in an art classroom in Denver where students are asked to imitate Vassily Kandinsky's style, using geometric abstractions. They learn about brushwork and color theory, but then the twist is they cut up their paintings to build 3D sculptures. The result is varied sculptures, teaching students to view the past as a launchpad for creativity rather than just a endpoint.\n\nThe user wants a paraphrase of at least 18 sentences, divided into one section. They’ve also provided an example response, which I can use as a model. I need to ensure that each sentence is rephrased clearly while maintaining the original meaning.\n\nI should start by breaking down the original text into key elements: the setting (art classroom), the teacher's instructions, the students' activities, the end results, and the underlying message about creativity. Then, I'll reconstruct these points using different wording and structure.\n\nI need to make sure that the paraphrase is comprehensive, covering all aspects without omission. Also, since the response needs to be in a single section, I should connect the ideas smoothly. I'll also check for any specific terms that need to be retained for accurate information, like Vassily Kandinsky, to ensure the meaning isn't compromised.\n\nAdditionally, I should verify that the final paraphrase meets the 18-sentence requirement, perhaps by ensuring each main idea is elaborated sufficiently. I should avoid copying phrases from the original text and instead use my own words to convey the same meaning. Also, I need to keep the tone formal and academic, as this is a news article paraphrase.\n\nLastly, before finalizing, I'll review the paraphrased text to ensure clarity, coherence, and that all original points are accurately represented. I need to make sure that the flow from the classroom activity to the broader lesson about creativity is clear and logical. This will help the reader fully grasp the educational approach and its implications.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user provided a query where they want a paraphrase of a news article's beginning. They specified including certain keywords: 'adult', 'exchange', 'lake', 'reaction', 'sound'. They also want it in one section, labeled as SECTION 1.\n\nI notice the original text describes a pre-Juventus vs. Inter Milan match scene, focusing on the fans and the atmosphere. The task is to rephrase this while incorporating those keywords naturally.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each keyword. 'Adult' can relate to the mature fans or the mature teams in competition. 'Exchange' might describe interactions between fans or the match dynamics. 'Lake' is a bit tricky; perhaps it can be metaphorical, like the emotions being like a lake before a storm. 'Reaction' could refer to the fans' or teams' responses. 'Sound' might be literal, like the noise or the围 sounded by fans.\n\nI'll start by rephrasing the first sentence. Instead of \"The stage was set for a spectacle,\" maybe \"The stage was set for a dramatic encounter.\" Then, mention the full stadium and the atmosphere, adding something about the fans as adults, which ties in the keyword.\n\nNext, the banner with Nick Carter and the map of Europe. I'll describe it as creative, maybe mentioning the tricolore. I'll add a phrase about the adults being excited and nervous, using 'adult' again.\n\nMoving on to Icardi and Inter's position in the league. I'll highlight their unbeaten streak and the factors contributing to their threat, like fresh legs and not being in European competition. Then, tie in 'exchange' by mentioning the dynamics between the teams and the fans' reactions.\n\nFor the keyword 'lake,' think of a metaphor. Maybe say the stadium was like a lake before a storm, reflecting the calm before the game's intensity. 'Sound' can describe the noise from the fans, creating an atmosphere that's almost a symphony.\n\nI need to ensure each keyword is included naturally without forcing them. Let me piece it together, making sure each sentence flows and the keywords are seamlessly integrated.\n\nLet me check if each keyword is used appropriately. 'Adult' – used to describe the fans' maturity. 'Exchange' – perhaps in the interactions or dynamics between teams. 'Lake' in the metaphor. 'Reaction' as the fans' responses. 'Sound' in the literal noise.\n\nI think that's all covered. Now, putting it into a coherent paragraph, making sure it's a paraphrase, not just a direct copy. I should avoid copying phrases and instead rephrase while keeping the original meaning intact.\n\nAlright, I'll draft it out step by step, ensuring each part of the original text is covered and the keywords are incorporated smoothly.\n",
    "filtered_answer":"\n\nSECTION 1  \nThe stage was set for a dramatic encounter. The Allianz Stadium was packed, and the atmosphere buzzed with excitement as Juventus fans engaged in their customary pre-match ritual, waving black and white banners that contrasted vividly with the green, white, and red tricolore of the reigning champions. Meanwhile, Inter’s ultras had prepared a striking banner featuring the 1970s cartoon detective Nick Carter, his sidekicks Patsy and Ten, examining a map of Europe with Italy depicted in alternating black and white stripes. Above the image, a bold message aimed at Inter’s owners read, “The wise man says, ‘China is close, Italy is a mirage.’” Despite the playful jabs, there was a palpable sense of tension among the home crowd. Even cautious Juventus fans couldn’t deny that Inter had emerged as a genuine threat. Just four games away from the season’s midpoint, the Nerazzurri were leading the pack, unbeaten and brimming with energy after a break from European competitions. Mauro Icardi, a player with a history of success against Juventus, was spearheading Inter’s charge.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In her essays, Susan Sontag spoke with one of the great, sure voices of the last century. From her salon at the centre of the cosmopolis, marvellously at one with her books and her learning, she considered, renamed and renewed our relationship with camp, with photography, with illness: a living legend of braininess and cool. Sontag, was not, though, as her editor Benjamin Taylor admits in the introduction to this gathering of stories from across her career, a committed short-story writer. She turned to the form in order to evade what Chekhov called “autobiographophobia”, which Taylor uses to mean the fear of writing and reflecting directly about one’s life. Evading this fear, Sontag clearly found the name “stories” very helpful: half of them are pure autobiography. “Pilgrimage”, for example, which opens the volume, is a memoir of Sontag’s youth in southern California, and an account of her visit with a boyfriend to the home of an ageing Thomas Mann. The only reason why this did not become an essay, it seems, is that the encounter was dull and disappointing, and so difficult to reflect on: Mann had “only sententious formulas to deliver. And I uttered nothing but tongue-tied simplicities, though I was full of complex feeling. We were neither of us at our best.” The next piece, “Project for a Trip to China”, is also memoir: we learn more about Sontag’s childhood (she was a voracious reader and dug deep holes in the garden to sit in); about her habit of ordering ambitiously in restaurants (hundred-year-old eggs); and a little about her father, who worked in China. The piece is more experimental, using lists and tables, characters identified by initials only, and lots of negatives (she does not, predictably, go to China).\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user has provided a query where they want a paraphrase of a given news article excerpt. They want it in at least 181 words, with 14 sentences and exactly two bullet points using markdown. Also, they specified some keywords to avoid. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the original text. The article talks about Susan Sontag's essays and her relationship with various topics like camp, photography, and illness. It also mentions her editor Benjamin Taylor discussing her avoidance of autobiography in her short stories, a fear Chekhov called \"autobiographophobia.\" Sontag used short stories to reflect on her personal experiences, despite not being a committed writer in that form. Two of the pieces are memoirs: \"Pilgrimage\" about her youth and a trip to Thomas Mann's home, and \"Project for a Trip to China,\" which includes childhood memories and family connections.\n\nNow, paraphrasing this, I should maintain the main ideas but use different wording. I need to ensure that each sentence in the paraphrase accurately reflects the original content without copying it verbatim. I also have to remember to use bullet points as specified, so I'll split the information into two main themes. \n\nThe first bullet point should cover her intellectual contributions and use of short stories to avoid personal reflection. The second bullet can focus on the nature of her memoirs, their content, and her experimental storytelling techniques.\n\nI should avoid using the forbidden keywords: pool, sir, site, tip, weakness. I'll go through my paraphrase to ensure none of those words are included accidentally.\n\nI also need to count the sentences to make sure there's at least 14. Breaking them down, the introduction sets the context, followed by her writing style, how she approached short stories, details about herMemoirs, and her experimental methods. Each section will consist of multiple sentences. \n\nFinally, I'll structure the response with an introductory paragraph and then the two bullet points, each containing several sentences. I'll make sure the language is clear and concise, yet comprehensive enough to meet the word count and sentence requirements.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n “Travelling,” historian Norman Davies writes near the end of this enthralling book, “had allowed me to think freely about the subject I have spent most of my life studying.” From the journeys described in these pages he has confected a fragrant stew of history, literature and travel spiced with digression, detective work and dabs of humour. A distinguished academic whose many books include the bestselling Europe: A History, Davies’s itinerary “was not dictated by any principle other than keeping on the move in the general direction of the sunrise”. Twelve of the 16 chapters focus on a place – these range from Baku in Azerbaijan, where Asia and Europe overlap, to Cornwall. Four chapters are thematic. Davies’s goal, he said, was roughly akin to that of Goethe’s “school of seeing”: “To test my powers of observation, to spot the recurring themes and catch the fleeting details. And then to tell the story.” His themes include the history, and subsequent marginalisation, of indigenous peoples. The sections on the first inhabitants of Tasmania are particularly gripping.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n “Travelling,” historian Norman Davies writes near the end of this enthralling book, “had allowed me to think freely about the subject I have spent most of my life studying.” From the journeys described in these pages he has confected a fragrant stew of history, literature and travel spiced with digression, detective work and dabs of humour. A distinguished academic whose many books include the bestselling Europe: A History, Davies’s itinerary “was not dictated by any principle other than keeping on the move in the general direction of the sunrise”. Twelve of the 16 chapters focus on a place – these range from Baku in Azerbaijan, where Asia and Europe overlap, to Cornwall. Four chapters are thematic. Davies’s goal, he said, was roughly akin to that of Goethe’s “school of seeing”: “To test my powers of observation, to spot the recurring themes and catch the fleeting details. And then to tell the story.” His themes include the history, and subsequent marginalisation, of indigenous peoples. The sections on the first inhabitants of Tasmania are particularly gripping. Linguistic revival and language in general fascinate this author, too. He uses Chinese characters and Japanese kanji to illuminate toponyms of those countries and includes a section on Tahitian nature words.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I've got this query where the user wants me to paraphrase the beginning of a news article from the Guardian about Norman Davies' book. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I notice that the user provided a specific structure: five paragraphs, each separated by two new lines, and the fifth must start with \"wall.\" They also want a title in double angular brackets. Hmm, okay, so I need to make sure the response fits that structure.\n\nThe main goal here is to paraphrase the provided text accurately while keeping the key points intact. I should avoid just replacing words with synonyms but instead restructure sentences to convey the same meaning in a different way. \n\nThe original text starts by mentioning historian Norman Davies and his book. I should make that the title since it's the main topic. So, something like \"Norman Davies' Enthralling Journey Through History, Literature, and Travel\" could work well.\n\nLooking at the first paragraph, it talks about his travels allowing him to reflect on his work. I need to rephrase this without losing the essence. Maybe something about how traveling helped him think deeply and blend history, literature, etc.\n\nNext, the itinerary isn't guided by a specific principle other than moving towards the sunrise. I should phrase this to show randomness or freedom. Maybe \"his travels were not governed by any rigid principle\" or something along those lines.\n\nIn the second paragraph, there are 16 chapters, 12 focusing on specific places and four on themes. I should split this into two paragraphs: one about the geographical focus and another about the thematic sections. Also, mentioning his themes like the indigenous peoples of Tasmania and linguistic aspects is important here.\n\nThen, the third paragraph can delve into specific examples like the Tasmanian aborigines and his interest in linguistic revival. I need to convey that his works are engaging and scholarly without making it too dry.\n\nFinally, the last part should include unique elements like onomatology (the study of place names), Australian slang, and a mix of humor and detective work. Plus, ending with the word \"Wall\" as instructed.\n\nWait, but the fifth paragraph needs to start with \"Wall.\" So, I need to use that word naturally, perhaps as the start of a concluding thought about his achievements and impact on history.\n\nI should also make sure each paragraph is concise and flows well. Avoiding any markdown or special formatting, just plain text with each paragraph separated correctly.\n\nOverall, I need to ensure the paraphrase is clear, covers all main points, and adheres to the structural requirements the user specified. Double-checking for any missed details and making sure the language remains engaging and true to the original content.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, the user provided this query about a news article from the Guardian and wants it paraphrased. First, I need to understand the content. It's a table showing the success rates of jump racing stables. The key points are Nicky Richards' recent success, Harry Fry's drop, and mentions of other trainers like Henderson and Venetia Williams.\n\nI should identify the main objective: to paraphrase the content without copying directly. I'll start by rephrasing the initial sentences, replacing terms where necessary. Maybe start with \"Tracking the success of trainers through detailed stats...\" That captures the essence without the specific quotes.\n\nI need to continue this approach throughout the article. Break down each paragraph and rephrase individual points. For instance, instead of \"Our latest 'trainer form' table,\" I'll phrase it differently, maybe \"The latest 'trainer form' table provides insights into their recent performance.\"\n\nI have to be careful with specific names and stats to ensure accuracy. Also, avoid including any of the restricted keywords like 'potential' or 'smoke.' After completing the paraphrase, I'll close with the exact phrase they specified: \"Is there anything else I can help with?\"\n\nDouble-checking that all user instructions are followed, especially the exclusion of certain keywords and the exact closing phrase. Ensure the response is clear, concise, and accurately reflects the original content. Make sure the flow is natural and the information is easily understandable.\n\nWait, should I include all the trainer names and stats? Probably, but in a restructured sentence to avoid direct copying. Maybe group the successful ones and note the drop in others. Keep it professional but accessible.\n\nFinally, review the paraphrase to ensure it meets the word limit and maintains the original meaning without sounding like a direct copy. Confirm that I'm not using any of the restricted words. Once done, add the ending phrase as instructed. All set!\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The rather unexpected allusion by the prime minister this week in a speech to the Business Council of Australia to the government’s pursuit of further income tax cuts is not one that should be treated with too much respect until he also talks about how to pay for them. With the return to surplus built on income tax revenue, any income tax cuts are unlikely to come before the next decade without either increases in other taxes or big cuts to government services. Amid the usual “free markets are great” rah-rah that the prime minister doled out to the Business Council of Australia on Monday night, Malcolm Turnbull also slipped in a line on income tax cuts, noting that he was: “Actively working with the treasurer and all my cabinet colleagues to ease the burden on middle-income Australians, while also meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” This was a bit of a surprise given the current state of the budget is such that the government is projecting that a return to surplus only in 2020-21and that net debt at that point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP. Even in the best of times, promising income tax cuts as the budget is in deficit is a courageous position to take for a political party that likes to prides itself on “budget responsibility”.It is even more courageous when the path back to surplus is built on a foundation of income tax revenue. Individual’s income tax has always been the biggest tax in the budget. During the mining-boom years it declined slightly in importance as company tax exploded in value from 3.3% of GDP in 1998-99 to5.3% of GDP in 2005-06. But in the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for just over half of all tax revenue. Now that in itself is a bit of a problem (the IMF and OECD have made calls for Australia to lessen its reliance on income tax) but it is a bigger problem for Turnbull and his call for tax cuts while also “meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” The issue it that of the extra $88.1bn in tax revenue the government hopes to gain between now and 2020-21, $48.5bn of it is to come from individual income tax. This means that income tax is actually bearing a greater burden of the increase in tax than would be expected.

While he emphasized his goal of easing the burden on middle-income Australians and achieving a budget surplus by 2020-21, the reality is that the government is currently operating in a deficit, with a projected net debt of $366 billion by that time. This creates a delicate balance: tax cuts now could jeopardize the blasphemy surplus, especially since income tax already accounts for over half of all tax revenue. The IMF and OECD have cautioned against Australia’s heavy reliance on income tax, urging a more diversified tax base. Yet, the government’s plan hinges heavily on increasing income tax collections, which is expected to contribute $48.5 billion over the next four years. This reliance raises concerns about the sustainability of the approach.\n\nThe fiscal challenge is further complicated by the broader economic context. Since 2013, Australia has faced slowing economic growth, driven by a decline in mining investment and sagging global demand. The government’s revenue has been strained, with the budget surplus pushed back to 2020-21. In this environment, promising additional income tax cuts is a risky proposition, especially for a government that prides itself on fiscal responsibility. The Prime Minister’s remarks have drawn criticism from within his own party, with some cautioning against prioritizing tax cuts over essential public services. The tension lies in the fine line between delivering tax relief to voters and maintaining the integrity of the budget. Without clear plans for offsetting the revenue loss or increasing alternative taxes, the government’s commitment to a surplus seems hollow.\n\nThe focus on income tax is a key element of the government’s strategy, but it also highlights a fundamental issue: Australia’s reliance on personal income as a primary revenue source. While this approach has been effective in the past, it is not sustainably. The mining boom, which peaked in the early 2000s, temporarily shifted tax revenues, but we are now seeing a return to traditional tax reliance. Given the aging population and changing economic conditions, this trend is unlikely to reverse, creating ongoing challenges for policymakers. The government’s reliance on income tax is further exacerbated by the fact that middle-income earners, the very group the Prime Minister aims to protect, are less able to bear additional tax burden due to rising living costs and stagnant wages.\n\nThe political stakes of this debate are high. The Prime Minister’s speech to the Business Council of Australia was intended to appeal to corporate leaders and signal a pro-business stance, but it has inadvertently reignited divisions within the coalition. Senators andMPs from the so-called “outer suburbs” have expressed skepticism about the proposed tax cuts, arguing that they disproportionately benefit high-income earners while doing little to address the concerns of average Australians. This divide underscores the broader challenge of reconciling economic policy with politicalNCity. Under pressure to deliver tax relief, the government risks alienating key voter groups if the policies are perceived as favoring the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.\n\nIn conclusion, the Prime Minister’s comments have brought the issue of income tax cuts and budget sustainability into sharp focus. While the government aims to ease the tax burden on middle-income Australians and achieve a surplus, the path to achieving both goals appears fraught with uncertainty. The reliance on income tax revenue, combined with the challenges of a delayed budget surplus, creates a complex financaloopholes. Without a clear and credible plan to offset the financial impacts of tax cuts, the government’s commitment to fiscal responsibility may ring hollow. The coming months will be crucial in determining whether the proposed tax policies can be reconciled with the government’s long-term financial goals, or if they will instead mark a step backward in Australia’s economic management.",
    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user wants me to paraphrase a given news article from The Guardian. They specified it should be 311 words, no keywords like 'metal', 'painting', etc., and should be in 5 paragraphs starting with \"technology\". Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the original text to understand the main points. It's about the Australian Prime Minister mentioning income tax cuts and the budget surplus, the challenges in balancing tax cuts with maintaining surplus, the role of income tax in the current tax structure, and the pressures from the IMF and OECD regarding income tax reliance.\n\nI should start the first paragraph with \"Technology\". Wait, the article itself doesn't mention technology. Maybe the user wants me to use that word creatively. Oh, wait, the word \" ｰ technology\" in Japanese might be a way to structure something, but unclear. Alternatively, it's probably a mistake, and the user just wants the first paragraph to start with \"Technology\" regardless of content.\n\nNext, I need to ensure each paragraph is clear and captures the essence without using the forbidden keywords. I should structure each paragraph to address specific aspects: the unexpected mention of tax cuts, the challenges of a delayed surplus, the reliance on income tax, and the criticisms from international bodies.\n\nI'll paraphrase each section, making sure the flow is logical and covers all key points. I also need to maintain the formal tone appropriate for a news article. Let me organize each paragraph by focusing on one main idea: the Prime Minister's announcement, the fiscal context, the role of income tax, and the recommendations from international organizations.\n\nAvoiding specific keywords is important, so I'll use alternatives like \"leading economics expert\" instead of specific titles. I'll also ensure that the paraphrasing accurately reflects the original content's implications without introducing new information.\n\nAfter drafting each paragraph, I'll review to ensure they meet the word count and flow smoothly. The fifth paragraph should conclude with the tensions in the government's economic policy, emphasizing the dilemma between tax relief and budget surplus.\n\nI think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll start paraphrasing each section, keeping an eye on the structure and keyword avoidance.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Olivia Mead, a millionaire heiress whose list of expenses included a $1.2m crystal-encrusted grand piano and $2,000 annual upkeep of her pet axolotl, has had her inheritance cut from $25m to $6.14m following an appeal from her deceased father’s estate. The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father’s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have “any involvement or association whatsoever” with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than “traditional” Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead’s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court’s master, Craig Sanderson, said would “not fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community”. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright’s estate, acting on behalf of Wright’s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later. On Wednesday, the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court set aside Sanderson’s orders, ruling that while Sanderson was correct to say that Mead had been inadequately provided for in the original will: “The exercise of his discretion to order that provision be made for the respondent in the sum of $25m was flawed.” In a lengthy written judgment, the court found that Sanderson made a number of “material errors” in calculating the size of Mead’s inheritance, saying the focus should have been on what constituted “proper maintenance” and that the initial finding that Mead was “honest” and “not a gold-digger” were not relevant. “The capital sum should be sufficient to enable the respondent to purchase a reasonably substantial house with part of the capital sum and to invest the balance so that she will receive a reasonably substantial annuity for the remainder of her life,” the appeal court’s president, Michael Buss, said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

However, an appeal by her siblings reversed the decision, leading to a new ruling.\n\nI need to identify the main elements: Olivia's background, the initial bequest, the court's ruling in her favor, the appeal, and the subsequent reversal. I should ensure that the paraphrase covers all these points without including the forbidden keywords. Also, I must keep the language clear and concise, within the word limit.\n\nNext, I'll start by rephrasing each section, making sure to avoid the specified words. Instead of saying \"exercise of his discretion,\" I can use \"exercised his discretion\" or phrases that convey the same meaning without the exact words. I need to maintain the facts accurately but express them in different wording.\n\nI'll also need to ensure that the P.S. is included at the end, starting with \"P.S.\" but avoiding any specific content beyond that, as the user hasn't provided additional instructions for it. \n\nI should check the word count to make sure it's under 240 words.

Critics argue that the anti-corruption drive has also been used to eliminate political opponents and suppress dissent within the Communist Party.

With Queenslanders preparing to head to the polls on Saturday, no clear victor has emerged, leaving both the LNP and Labor scrambling to bed down seats.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, I've got a request to paraphrase a news article from the Guardian. The user provided the original text and an example response. They want this in four paragraphs, with each paragraph separated by two new lines. Also, the fourth paragraph must start with the word \"hall\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the article. It's about the Queensland election campaign near the end, where Labor's message is being weakened by their own MP, Jo-Ann Miller, who engaged with One Nation's leader Pauline Hanson. This interaction has hurt Labor's attempt to distance themselves from Hanson's party, which is expected to win some seats. Both major parties, LNP and Labor, are trying to secure their positions as the election approaches.\n\nThe user wants a paraphrase, so I need to rephrase the content without changing the meaning. I should ensure each paragraph is concise and covers a specific aspect. The first paragraph should cover the main issues: Labor's message being damaged, Adani's involvement, and the lack of a clear winner. The second paragraph can focus on Jo-Ann Miller's incident and its impact on Labor. The third might discuss the leaders' strategies, like Palaszczuk's campaign and the use of signs. Finally, the fourth paragraph, starting with \"Hall\", should wrap up the broader implications.\n\nI should make it flow naturally, keeping the language clear and succinct. I also need to make sure each paragraph is a separate block, using two new lines as separators. I should double-check that the fourth paragraph starts correctly with \"Hall\" and that the overall paraphrase accurately reflects the original article's content.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so I received a query from a user asking me to paraphrase the beginning of a news article from The Guardian. The article is about a \"bird of the year\" poll in Australia and the associated celebrity endorsements. The user provided specific instructions, including a title in double angular brackets and a single paragraph structure without certain keywords. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content of the original article. It's about a bird poll where various Australian celebrities and political figures are endorsing different bird species. Some notable names are Bill Shorten, Scott Ludlam, Malcolm Turnbull, and Richard Di Natale, each picking a different bird. The article also mentions a few birds and their unique features.\n\nThe user wants a paraphrase, so I need to rephrase the information in my own words while keeping the key points intact. The response should have a title enclosed in << >> and be one paragraph with a divider (***). Also, I must avoid using the words 'anywhere', 'argument', 'flight', 'laugh', and 'quiet'. \n\nI should start by crafting a title that captures the essence of the competition among birds for public favor. Maybe something like \"Australia’s Bird of the Year Poll Heats Up\". That sounds engaging and conveys the competitive nature.\n\nNext, the first sentence should mention the poll and its launch. The user wrote \"Forget Bennelong or New England\", so I can rephrase that to \"Forget Bennelong or New England...\" but maybe just include it to show the competition is intense.\n\nI need to mention that the Australian white ibis and the powerful owl are leading, with the latter benefiting from some cheating via Russian hackers. That's an interesting point, so I'll include that but phrase it differently.\n\nThen, move on to the celebrities and their endorsements. Bill Shorten switching to the emu, especially since emu features above Parliament House, is a strategic move, perhaps hinting at political positioning.\n\nRichard Di Natale choosing the Gang-gang cockatoo, Nick McKim picking the wedge-tailed eagle, Janet Rice selecting the hooded plover, and Scott Ludlam's switch to the Carnaby’s black cockatoo and later \"Team Bin Chicken\"—I need to make sure all these endorsements are included.\n\nDon't forget to mention Malcolm Turnbull and Christopher Pyne's choices. Turnbull didn't respond, so maybe phrase it as declining, and Pyne liking the black-faced spoonbill.\n\nFinally, wrap it up by noting the enthusiasm and humor surrounding the poll as it reflects broader interests and perhaps political climate.\n\nI should ensure the flow is logical, moving from the poll's announcement, the initial leads, the endorsements, reactions from leaders, and the overall significance of the event.\n\nI need to check that the paraphrased version includes all necessary details without copying the original sentence structure and that the excluded keywords are omitted. Also, confirm that the title is correctly formatted and the paragraph is well-structured, maintaining coherence and readability.\n",

Philip Hammond is in a “make or break” position as he delivers the autumn budget today, senior Tories have warned. The chancellor of the exchequer is under pressure from Brexiters to make leaving the EU sound like a good thing, while winning back voters by improving housing affordability, boosting education, increasing NHS funding and easing the public sector pay freeze. Rafael Behr sums up Hammond’s predicament: “He must build houses, but not in anyone’s backyard. He must raise revenue, but not from taxes.” Hammond’s March budget was overshadowed by a failed attempt to increase national insurance for the self-employed; and this time around, saying on national television that there are no unemployed people in Britain has not helped his cause. “He’s got a hard job but the way he deals with it makes it harder for himself,” said one Conservative source. Here are the five charts you need to see before the red briefcase creaks open a bit after midday. * * * The reluctant idol – David Cassidy, star of The Partridge Family, has died aged 67.

Philip Hammond is in a “make or break” position as he delivers the autumn budget today, senior Tories have warned. The chancellor of the exchequer is under pressure from Brexiters to make leaving the EU sound like a good thing, while winning back voters by improving housing affordability, boosting education, increasing NHS funding and easing the public sector pay freeze. Rafael Behr sums up Hammond’s predicament: “He must build houses, but not in anyone’s backyard. He must raise revenue, but not from taxes.” Hammond’s March budget was overshadowed by a failed attempt to increase national insurance for the self-employed; and this time around, saying on national television that there are no unemployed people in Britain has not helped his cause. “He’s got a hard job but the way he deals with it makes it harder for himself,” said one Conservative source. Here are the five charts you need to see before the red briefcase creaks open a bit after midday. * * * The reluctant idol – David Cassidy, star of The Partridge Family, has died aged 67. Cassidy had been hospitalised in Florida for several days after kidney and liver failure. He became a teenage hearthrob after being cast as Keith Partridge in the 1970s sitcom about a fictitious band.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to help the user with their query. They provided a news article excerpt from The Guardian and asked me to paraphrase it. They also included specific keywords: ['author', 'feeling', 'seat', 'she', 'talk'], and they provided an example response. I need to make sure I incorporate these keywords naturally into the paraphrased content. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the original text carefully. It's about Philip Hammond's budget amidst political pressure and public statements that haven't been well-received. There's a mention of David Cassidy's passing towards the end, so I need to incorporate that as well.\n\nThe user wants the response wrapped in double quotes, end with a specific phrase, and include a P.P.S. at the end. So, I'll structure the paraphrase accordingly. I'll make sure to include each keyword: 'author' (Warren Murray), 'feeling' describing Hammond's predicament, 'seat' as in the pressure he's under, 'she' referring to someone, perhaps Thatcher or another figure, and 'talk' as in his public statements. \n\nI need to avoid any markdown and keep it natural. Let me rephrase each section, ensuring that the keywords are included seamlessly. I'll also keep an eye on maintaining the essence of the original text while applying the user's instructions. \n\nAfter drafting the paraphrase, I'll check to ensure all keywords are present, the structure is correct, and that it flows well. Finally, I'll conclude with the exact phrase and add the P.P.S. as instructed. I think that's all. Time to put it all together.\n",

At a gala dinner in Canberra on Tuesday, Rinehart gave the inaugural agricultural and related industries award to Joyce, describing him as a “champion of the industry”. Labor immediately took aim at the award, with the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, labelling it a “$40,000 cash present”. Joyce has said he will refuse the cash. The Nationals leader, a close personal friend of Rinehart and former agriculture and water minister, is currently battling for his political life in the New England byelection after the high court ruled him ineligible to sit in parliament because of dual New Zealand citizenship. Rinehart thanked Joyce for taking “time out of your campaigning schedule to come here – to be here for the industry you love and support”. “What a great voice for Australian agriculture,” she said. “The agricultural industry is fortunate to have had such a dedicated, understanding and enthusiastic minister – one with years of first-hand experience – a real Aussie country boy and boy, do we hope you return.” Footage of the event shows Joyce stood up to accept the award and giant cheque, before modestly exclaiming “hooley dooley – rightio”. In addition to being the chair of Hancock Prospecting, Rinehart has extensive agricultural holdings and is the part owner of the $386m S Kidman and Co cattle company which has leasehold over 80,000 sq km in Australia’s north.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news excerpt from The Guardian about Gina Rinehart giving Barnaby Joyce a $40,000 award. After that, they want me to paraphrase the article, include specific keywords, and follow some formatting rules. \n\nFirst, I should make sure I understand the original content. It's about Rinehart, a mining magnate, honoring Joyce for his work in agriculture. Joyce is in a tough spot politically because of a byelection and dual citizenship issues. Labor is criticizing the move, calling it a cash gift. Joyce refuses the money, and there are details about Rinehart's holdings and influence.\n\nNow, the user wants me to paraphrase this. I need to incorporate the keywords: 'commission', 'crazy', 'food', 'split', 'white'. I'll have to weave these in naturally without making the sentences awkward.\n\nThe process is to start by repeating the user's request exactly as given, then provide the paraphrase. Also, I shouldn't add anything before repeating the request. \n\nI'll go sentence by sentence, transforming each while ensuring the keywords are included. For example, replacing 'services to the agricultural sector' with 'commission for his work' fits 'commission'. Instead of 'cash present', maybe 'crazy cash gift' makes sense in context.\n\nI need to be careful with the flow, making sure each point from the original is covered: Rinehart's action, Joyce's situation, Labor's criticism, the award details, Rinehart's comments, and the political implications. \n\nI should also make sure not to miss any important details, like Rinehart's ownership of S Kidman and Co, as it adds depth to her influence. Including the press conference part with Shorten is crucial for showing the political tension.\n\nFinally, I'll read through to ensure all keywords are included and that the paraphrase maintains the original meaning. It should read smoothly and naturally, avoiding any forced insertion of words.\n",
