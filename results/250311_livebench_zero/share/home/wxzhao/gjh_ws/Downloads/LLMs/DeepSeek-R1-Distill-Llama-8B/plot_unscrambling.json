    "ground_truth":"The first king of Aurea leads a futile attack on a dragon residing in his realm. All the king's men are killed, leaving the king at the Dragon's mercy. Centuries later, Elodie, the adolescent daughter of Lord Bayford, receives a proposal from Queen Isabelle of Aurea to marry her son, Prince Henry. On her father's urging, Elodie agrees to the marriage so her bride price can help their impoverished people. Upon arriving in Aurea, Elodie and Henry are initially uninterested in each other, but begin to bond as they share a desire to travel. Elodie's stepmother, Lady Bayford, becomes suspicious of the motives of Queen Isabelle, leading her to futilely implore Elodie to end the engagement. After the wedding, Elodie and Henry take part in an ancient ritual in the mountains, supposedly to celebrate their union. Isabelle describes the pact between the first king and the Dragon, where he had to sacrifice his three daughters to ensure peace between his people and the dragon. Following a ceremony where their palms are cut and held together, Henry carries Elodie across the narrow path over the Dragon's lair, then at Isabelle's behest throws her down the chasm. Recovering from the fall, Elodie realizes that she is the actual sacrifice. She escapes the Dragon after it burns her leg, and discovers an illuminated cave filled with glowing silk worms, which she collects as a light source. Elodie reaches a chamber with the note 'Safe Here She Cannot Reach', the names of past victims, and a map carved into the wall. In Elodie's sleep, the worms heal the burn on her leg. Elodie follows the map to a dead end at a high vertical drop on the mountainside. She discovers the remains of dead dragon hatchlings, explaining the reason for the royal sacrifices. A rescue party led by Lord Bayford arrives. The Dragon kills them, including Lord Bayford, but the distraction allows Elodie to escape the mountain. She takes one of the rescue party's horses and hides under a rock as the Dragon burns the surrounding area in an unsuccessful pursuit. Alerted by the conflagration that Elodie's sacrifice has failed, Isabelle resorts to kidnapping Elodie's younger sister Floria as a replacement. After learning this from a desperate Lady Bayford, Elodie returns to the mountain to rescue Floria, who the dragon has left alive as bait. Elodie creates a diversion to reach Floria. Telling her sister to hide, she confronts the Dragon and tries to convince her that they were deceived by the Aureans: by joining their cut hands at the wedding, the blood of the brides and the Aurean royals mingled, making the Dragon think of the princesses as being of Aurean descent. Refusing to believe Elodie, the Dragon states that the first king's assault was unprovoked, and then attacks her, but Elodie tricks her into burning herself. With the Dragon at her mercy, she convinces the Dragon of the truth and heals both of them with the glowing worms. Elodie then interrupts the wedding of another sacrifice at the palace, exposing the Aurean royal family's treachery.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so the user has given me a plot summary that's all jumbled up, and I need to reorder it correctly. Hmm, okay, that sounds a bit challenging, but I think I can handle it. Let me start by reading through all the sentences to get a sense of the story.\n\nFirst, I notice that the plot involves a character named Elodie who is involved in a sacrifice at a wedding. There's a Dragon and some royal family dynamics. The sentences mention various events happening at the palace, a rescue attempt, a kidnap of a sister, and aDragon's attack.\n\nI think the best approach is to identify the key plot points and see how they logically follow each other. Starting from the beginning, Elodie interrupting the wedding and exposing the treachery makes sense as the inciting incident. Then she escapes the mountain with a horse, and the Dragon pursues her. She uses the glowing worms to heal both of them, which is an important turning point.\n\nAfter that, the Dragon tries to burn the palace but fails, leading to Elodie rescuing her sister Floria with the help of a rescue party. Then there's a part where the Dragon attacks again, but Elodie confronts him, convincing him of their deception. Lady Bayford becomes suspicious, leading to the king's forces being killed, leaving the king at the Dragon's mercy.\n\nElodie then follows a map to a drop, but that's a dead end. Lady Bayford informs her about Floria being bait, so she returns to save Floria. The rescue team arrives, and Lord Bayford helps her cross the chasm. There's a ceremony where palms are cut, but Henry throws Elodie down, which seems crucial because she's the actual sacrifice.\n\nMoving forward in time, Elodie is now a teenager and receives a proposal from Queen Isabelle. She's suspicious, thinking she's the sacrifice, which she kind of is, but she escapes and finds the glowing worms again. She and Henry bond and go on a journey, discovering the truth about the dragon sacrifices. After the wedding, they perform a ritual on the mountains, celebrating their union.\n\nPutting all these events in order, I think the correct sequence starts with Elodie interrupting the wedding, leading to her escape, healing the Dragon, and then the rescue of Floria. Then there's a clash at the palace, the king's defeat, the failed map attempt, returning for Floria, the rescue, and Henry's betrayal. Then the time jump to the proposal, realization of her fate, escaping, finding the worms, bonding with Henry, and the ritual.\n\nI need to make sure each sentence follows logically from the previous one, maintaining the flow of the story. I'll list out the sentences again and match them step by step.\n\nStarting with Elodie interrupting the wedding, then escaping the mountain. She heals the Dragon, convinced him. The Dragon wasn't successful in burning the palace, so the sacrifice didn't work, allowing Floria to be saved. Then the Dragon attacks again after being deceived, leading to the confrontation.\n\nLady Bayford's suspicion causes the king's defeat. Elodie gets a note and the map, but it's a dead end. Learning about Floria being bait, she returns. The rescue team arrives, and Lord Bayford helps her escape. At the ceremony, Henry betrays her by throwing her down, making her the sacrifice.\n\nIn the future, she's engaged to Henry, but on the wedding night, she realizes she's the sacrifice. She escapes, finds the worms, and discovers the truth about the dragon hatchlings. After the wedding, they perform the ritual, celebrating their union with a symbolic burning.\n\nI think that's the correct order. Let me double-check each transition. After the initial escape, the Dragon's unsuccessful pursuit leads to the next event. Then, Floria's rescue, the Dragon's attack, and the king's defeat. Then, Elodie tries to rescue Floria but hits a dead end, which leads to returning later. Finally, the betrayal and the discovery of the truth, leading up to the ritual.\n\nYes, that seems to follow the plot correctly.\n",

A fan of comic books, Charlotte regularly bonds with Ethan over the creation of her character 'Fang Girl', but feels constantly isolated due to the presence of her infant half-brother Liam One night, Charlotte stumbles upon a tiny spider hatched from a strange, glowing object that crash-lands in her great-aunt's apartment. Intrigued, Charlotte decides to keep the spider as a pet, naming it Sting. As Charlotte cares for Sting, the spider begins to grow at an alarming rate. She initially keeps its size a secret, but as it becomes more difficult to hide, Ethan and some of the apartment tenants start to notice strange occurrences around the building. Sting's growing size and insatiable appetite soon lead to the death of pets and residents, which worsen after Charlotte leaves it in the care of her neighbor Eric. Following an argument with Ethan after Eric exposes Sting's presence, Charlotte's relationship with him becomes strained over the fact that her biological father has been neglecting her. Sometime after, Sting attacks and kidnaps both Ethan and Heather along Liam, forcing a distressed Charlotte to intervene.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so I've got this query where a user has provided a plot summary of a movie, but the sentences are all jumbled. My task is to put them in the correct order. Hmm, okay, let's start by carefully reading through each sentence to understand the flow of the story. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the sentences and try to group them into coherent parts. The first sentence talks about Charlotte caring for Sting and its growth. That seems like the beginning of the story, so maybe that's the starting point. Then, she names it Sting, which is a crucial introductory detail. \n\nNext, there's a showdown in the basement where Sting attacks. This likely follows the initial care part because it's a conflict that arises from having the spider. After that, Charlotte lures it into a trap with Ethan. This action probably leads to an immediate resolution, so that should come next. \n\nThe death of pets and residents happens as a consequence, which is a turning point. So, after the initial battle, the situation escalates with more damage. Then, Charlotte leaves Sting with her neighbor Eric, which might cause more problems, so that would come after. \n\nAs Charlotte saves Ethan, they face obstacles, which suggests a dilemma or further challenges. So probably after dealing with Eric, she helps Ethan and they face more from Sting. \n\nThe part about her comic book character 'Fang Girl' and connecting with Ethan indicates some character bonding, so maybe that's in the middle somewhere, perhaps after initial conflicts but before things escalate further. \n\nOne night, she finds a tiny spider from a glowing object—this seems like the inciting incident that brings Sting into her life, so that should come earlier. She keeps it a secret at first but then can't hide it anymore, which leads to others noticing odd occurrences. \n\nCharlotte lives in a bad apartment building with her parents: Ethan, Heather, and a half-brother Liam. This sets up her family situation, so perhaps this runs parallel as she's dealing with Sting. \n\nThe tension escalates when Sting traps residents using sounds, so that comes after the initial attacks and family issues. Then, they use a trash compression device to destroy Sting but suffer losses. \n\nAfter that, Sting attacks and kidnaps Ethan, Heather, and Liam, forcing Charlotte to act again, which leads her to seek help and learn the spider's weakness. \n\nThere's an argument with Ethan after Eric exposes Sting, which strains their relationship. Her biological father's neglect is also a point of tension. \n\nI think the correct order starts with the discovery of the tiny spider, then the care and growth, leading to the initial attack. After that, she leaves Sting with Eric, which causes more problems, and then she has to save Ethan. During this time, her family issues with the neglected father are building up. Simultaneously, as she deals with the spider, the building's situation escalates with more residents trapped. Finally, she confronts Sting again, leading to the final battle and a resolution, which also affects her relationship with Ethan.\n\nSo, arranging all this, the plot summary should start with the discovery of the tiny spider, then introduce Charlotte's life, the initial attacks, her relationships, and the final showdown. I'll make sure each sentence logically follows the previous one, creating a smooth narrative flow without jumping too much.\n",

    "ground_truth":"In late 1941, during World War II the United Kingdom is struggling to halt Nazi Germany's attempts to take over Europe, with London regularly suffering bombing runs at the hands of the Luftwaffe. With their supply and aid ships constantly sunk by German submarines, Brigadier Colin Gubbins, with the indirect backing of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, prepares to initiate Operation Postmaster, an off the books black-ops sabotage mission intended to disrupt the Nazis' U-boat resupply operation on the Spanish-controlled island Fernando Po. While SOE agents Marjorie Stewart and Richard Heron depart by train, Gubbins enlists Gus March-Phillips to assemble a ground team to destroy the Italian supply ship Duchessa d'Aosta and two tugboats attached to it. Using the neutral Swedish fishing trawler Maid of Honor, Gus and his allies, Graham Hayes, Freddy Alvarez, and Danish naval officer Anders Lassen (the only non-British subject to be awarded the Victoria Cross), begin the slow sail to Fernando Po. Upon discovering that SOE saboteur Geoffrey Appleyard, whom Gubbins had sent ahead on the assumption that Gus would show interest in wanting him on the team, was captured by Gestapo agents, they divert course to a Nazi-controlled section of the Canary Islands for a rescue mission. Meanwhile, arriving early on Fernando Po, Marjorie and Heron use the latter's 'illegal' gambling hall to recruit backup for Gus' team while Marjorie seduces Heinrich Luhr, the SS commander in charge. Upon learning that the Duchessa intends to depart three days ahead of schedule, Gus has his crew sail through a British naval blockade of Nazi-occupied West Africa despite knowing they'll be arrested should their unauthorized mission be discovered. On the night of the intended raid, Marjorie and Heron learn that Luhr has had the Duchessa's hull reinforced despite the Italian attache's reservations. Barely warned of this in time, Gus and Appleyard decide that their best course of action is to hijack the ships and use them as a bartering chip after a mole in Gubbins' staff reveals the mission to senior command. Although Luhr eventually catches on when Marjorie's act begins to 'slip', the raid is ultimately successful, and Marjorie shoots Luhr in the head. Delivering the boats to a British fleet outside Lagos, the team is nonetheless arrested. While waiting to be court-martialed, they are saved and recruited by Churchill as part of his 'Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare', as their actions have not only severely damaged the Nazis' naval strength, but also have allowed the United States, who recently entered the war following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, to join the European theatre. A montage of details before the end credits reveal the post operation activities of several protagonists: Gus became a war hero and would helm several similar raids during the war before marrying Marjorie at the start of her acting career; Appleyard would receive several commendations for his role in the mission, much to the king's amusement; Hayes would go on to become a highly accomplished spy notable for surviving a year of Nazi torture without breaking; Lassen would go on to take part in raids outside the group until his death in 1945; Ian Fleming, who had been part of Gubbins' inner circle during this time, would use Operation Postmaster as the inspirational basis for his James Bond novels.",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I've got this query where a user has provided a plot summary of a movie, but the sentences have been randomly reordered. The task is to help the user rewrite the plot summary with the sentences correctly ordered, starting with <PLOT_SUMMARY>. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the user's goal. They want the plot summary reconstructed from the scrambled sentences. That means I have to identify the correct order of events and characters. This might be a bit tricky because the sentences are all part of the same summary but just jumbled. \n\nI should start by reading through each sentence carefully to figure out the sequence. The plot seems to involve a group of individuals, likely based on real historical figures, involved in some covert operations during World War II. Key characters mentioned include Marjorie, Heron, Luhr, Colin Gubbins, Winston Churchill, Operation Postmaster, Gus March-Phillips, and others. \n\nLooking at the sentences, the first part mentions the night of the intended raid when Marjorie and Heron learn about Luhr's actions. Then it talks about their supply ships being sunk, leading to Operation Postmaster being prepared. Another sentence mentions their arrival on Fernando Po and recruiting backup. \n\nSo the order should probably start with them learning about Luhr's reinforcement, then their supply issues, followed by the initiation of the operation. Then their arrival on Fernando Po and the recruitment. After that, the planning phase with their team, some subplots about betrayal, the execution of the operation, and the aftermath. \n\nI should also pay attention to the chronological order of events. For example, mentioning that after their arrest, they are recruited by Churchill. Then, the betrayal of Appleyard, which leads them to the Canary Islands for a rescue. Then moving on to the subsequent events in late 1941. \n\nThere's also a part about the montage at the end, showing the characters' fates post-operation. That should come towards the end to wrap things up. \n\nI should piece the sentences together logically, ensuring that each event follows the previous one. Maybe start with the initial discovery, then the impact on their mission, followed by their actions on Fernando Po, the betrayal, the attempted rescue, the arrest, the successful sabotage, the aftermath of the operation, and finally the consequences for each character involved.\n\nI need to be careful not to mix up events that should follow each other. For instance, the part about the mole in Gubbins' staff revealing the mission should come after they've already started their plan but before it's executed. Also, the successful sabotage should be towards the end, followed by the consequences and the montage.\n\nI'll start by listing the sentences in the order they appear in the reconstructed plot, making sure each one logically follows the previous one. This might involve some trial and error, especially since the jumbling could disrupt the causal flow. \n\nOnce I have a cohesive sequence, I can present it as the <PLOT_SUMMARY>, ensuring that the user gets a clear and accurate plot summary with the sentences correctly ordered.\n",

A montage of details before the end credits reveal the post-operation activities of several protagonists: Gus became a war hero and would helm several similar raids during the war before marrying Marjorie at the start of her acting career; Appleyard would receive several commendations for his role in the mission, much to the king's amusement; Hayes would go on to become a highly accomplished spy notable for surviving a year of Nazi torture without breaking; Lassen would go on to take part in raids outside the group until his death in 1945; Ian Fleming, who had been part of Gubbins' inner circle during this time, would use Operation Postmaster as the inspirational basis for his James Bond novels. Upon learning that the Duchessa intends to depart three days ahead of schedule, Gus has his crew sail through a British naval blockade of Nazi-occupied West Africa despite knowing they'll be arrested should their unauthorized mission be discovered. Although Luhr eventually catches on when Marjorie's act begins to 'slip,' the raid is ultimately successful, and Marjorie shoots Luhr in the head.",

    "ground_truth":"Years after a global catastrophe, Australia is a radioactive wasteland and the Green Place of Many Mothers is one of the last remaining areas with fresh water and agriculture. Raiders discover the Green Place while two kids, Furiosa and Valkyrie, are picking peaches. Furiosa attempts to sabotage their motorbikes, but the raiders capture her as a prize for their leader, warlord Dementus of the Biker Horde. Furiosa's mother Mary pursues them to the Horde's camp, killing all but one raider. The last raider delivers Furiosa to Dementus, but Furiosa mortally wounds him before he can reveal the Green Place's location. Mary sneaks into the camp and rescues Furiosa; the Horde gives chase. Mary stays back to buy Furiosa time to escape and gives her a peach pit to remember her by, but Furiosa returns to her mother anyway. Dementus forces Furiosa to watch her mother's crucifixion. Haunted by the death of his family, he adopts Furiosa as his daughter, hoping that she will lead him to the Green Place. Furiosa tattoos a star chart to the Green Place on her left arm to find her way home. After receiving a tip from a stranded soldier, Dementus and the Biker Horde besiege the Citadel, another Wasteland settlement with fresh water and agriculture. They are repelled by the War Boys, the fanatical army of Citadel warlord Immortan Joe. Dementus changes course, using a Trojan Horse strategy to capture Gastown, an oil refinery that supplies the Citadel with gasoline. At peace negotiations, Joe agrees to recognize Dementus's authority over Gastown and increase its supplies of food and water in exchange for the Horde's physician and Furiosa. At the Citadel, Immortan Joe imprisons Furiosa in the vault with his stable of 'wives'. After Joe's son Rictus shows an attraction to her, she devises a plan to escape. One night, Rictus breaks Furiosa out of the vault to make sexual advances toward her; using a wig made from her own hair, she slips from his grasp and disappears. Disguised as a mute teenage boy, Furiosa works her way up the ranks of Immortan Joe's men for over a decade and helps build the 'War Rig', a heavily-armed supply tanker that can withstand raider attacks in the lawless Wasteland. During one such attack, the Rig's crew are wiped out, leaving its commander, Praetorian Jack, and Furiosa as the only survivors. Furiosa attempts to carjack the Rig and return to the Green Place, but Jack easily thwarts her. However, Jack recognizes her potential and offers to train her to escape the Citadel if she helps him rebuild his crew. Furiosa becomes Jack's second-in-command and is promoted to Praetorian; the two bond and resolve to escape together one day. Immortan Joe decides to attack Gastown, as Dementus's mismanagement has led the facility to near-ruin. He orders Furiosa and Jack to collect weapons and ammunition from the Bullet Farm, an allied mining facility. However, Dementus, having preemptively attacked and captured the Bullet Farm, ambushes the War Rig on arrival; Furiosa and Jack barely escape, and Furiosa's left arm is severely injured. Dementus eventually chases them down and tortures Jack to death. Furiosa escapes her chains by severing her own injured arm, sacrificing her star map to escape; a loner watches Furiosa return to the Citadel. Upon arrival, Furiosa helps Joe plan a 40-day war, during which most of Dementus's horde is killed. Having lost her path home, Furiosa shaves her head again, replaces her arm with a mechanical prosthetic, and pursues Dementus by herself as he flees with the remnants of his horde. After an extended chase, she captures him in the desert. Dementus taunts her, saying revenge will not make her whole. In a voiceover, the potentially unreliable narrator claims that Furiosa imprisoned Dementus at the Citadel and used his living body as fertilizer to grow a peach tree from her mother's seed. For her services, Immortan Joe promotes Furiosa to 'Imperator' and gives her command of a new War Rig. She eventually meets Joe's five remaining wives in the vault where Joe once held her prisoner.

Furiosa escapes her chains by severing her own injured arm, sacrificing her star map to escape; a loner watches Furiosa return to the Citadel.\n33. Furiosa tattoos a star chart to the Green Place on her her left arm to find her way home.\n34. Mary sneaks into the camp and rescues Furiosa; the Horde gives chase.\n\nNow, I need to figure out the correct order. Let's think about the timeline.\n\nThe opening should introduce the main characters and the setting. Probably start with Furiosa being in the Citadel, imprisoned, and then escaping.\n\nSentence 5 mentions Furiosa imprisoned Dementus and using his body as fertilizer. Maybe that's after she escapes.\n\nSentence 1-2: Joe's son Rictus is attracted to Furiosa, so Furiosa devises a plan to escape, disguised as a mute boy, working her way up. Then Mary (her mother) comes, kills raiders. Then Jack helps her, so sentence 3-4: Mary comes, kills raiders. Jack sees Furiosa's potential, trains her.\n\nThen, after training, they help build the War Rig. Then, an attack happens, Rig's crew is wiped out, leaving Jack and Furiosa.\n\nHaunted by family, Jack adopts Furiosa, hoping she'll lead him to the Green Place (sentence 7-8). Then Rictus tries to break her out (sentence 9), she escapes.\n\nThen, in the final scene, the Five Wives hide in the War Rig (sentence 10). Arrival at the camp, she helps Joe plan a war, killing many Dementus's horde (sentence11).\n\nJoe imprisons her and makes her Imperator (sentence12). Then, a raider brings her to Dementus, who is injured, but she kills him (sentence13).\n\nShe becomes Jack's second-in-command (sentence14). Then, Dementus changes course (sentence15). Peace negotiations fail, Joe attacks Gastown (sentence16-17). Dementus forces Furiosa to watch her mother's crucifixion (sentence18).\n\nThen, years later, Global catastrophe, Australia is wasted. Dementus preys on the Bullet Farm, War Rig arrives, they barely escape, Furiosa's arm injured (sentence19-20).\n\nAfter chase, capture (sentence21), Dementus later chases, kills Jack (sentence22-23). Furiosa is captured (sentence24).\n\nDementus besieges Citadel, repelled by War Boys (sentence25-26). She meets Joe's wives (sentence27). Raiders find the Green Place with her and Valkyrie (sentence28). She tries to carjack, Jack stops her (sentence29).\n\nMary stays to help, Furiosa goes back (sentence30). Furiosa loses her way, gets prosthetic, chases Dementus alone (sentence31). Escapes chains, loses star map (sentence32). Tattoos star chart (sentence33). Mary rescues, chase (sentence34).\n\nPutting it all in order:\n\nStart at the beginning: Furiosa in the Citadel, imprisoned (sentences 5,12,21). So sentence5: narrator talks about her imprisonment. Then sentence12: Joe makes her Imperator. Then, after she escapes (sentence24-26, but probably she captures Dementus first (sentence21). So maybe sentence5: Imprisonment. Then sentence12: Promotion. Then sentence13: Dementus attack. sentence24: capture.\n\nWait, perhaps the event flow is:\n\n- Imprisonment (5): Dementus captured, peach tree from mother's seed, voiceover.\n\n- Then, as Imperator (sentence12), she leads a new War Rig.\n\n- Then, Dementus tries to capture her, fails (sentence21), but later (sentence24) he captures her again.\n\nHmm, maybe the timeline is:\n\n- Stop 1: Furiosa's early life, working her way up (1,2,3). Then Rictus tried to collect her (9), she escaped (9).\n\n- Then Jack joins (4,7-8: Jack adopts), then they collect weapons (6), Rig's crew wiped out (7-8).\n\n- Then, in the future, arriving at the camp, planning the 40-day war (10-11). Joe imprisons her again (12). Then, Dementus attacks, she kills him (13).\n\n- Furiosa becomes second-in-command (14), then Dementus changes course, attacks Gastown (15-17), she escapes, Chruchill's crucifixion (18).\n\n- Years later: Wasteland, Dementus captures Rig (19-20). She escapes, prosthetic arm (31). Loses star map, then finds her way (33). Mary rescues (34).\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should split into major events:\n\n1. Furiosa's early life: Working up the ranks, building the War Rig (sentences2, 1,3). Rictus attracted to her (1). Mary pursues, kills raiders (3). Jack sees potential, trains her (4,7-8). They plan escape (6). Rig crew wiped out (7-8).\n\n2. She becomes Imperator at Citadel (12). Then, after escaping (9), she helps Joe with the 40-day war (10-11). Then Dementus comes, she kills him (13), becomes Jack's leader (14).\n\n3. Dementus then goes to Gastown (15-17), Furiosa is forced to watch crucifixion (18).\n\n4. Years later: Post-apocalypse, War Rig attacked (19), Furiosa escapes, Arm injury (20). Captures Dementus (21). Later, Dementus kills Jack (22-23), Furiosa captured (24).\n\n5. Dementus attacks Citadel, repelled (25-26). Furiosa meets Joe's wives (27). Raiders find Green Place with her (28). She carjacks fails (29). Mary helps her, Furiosa goes back (30). Loses her way, prosthetic (31). Escapes, loses star map (32). Saved by Mary, manages to find home (34).\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe the best approach is to start from the beginning:\n\n- Sentence5: Narrator says she imprisoned Dementus, grew peach tree.\n\n- Then Sentence1: Joe's son Rictus attracted to her, she plans to escape.\n\n- Sentence2: Working as mute boy, builds War Rig.\n\n- Sentence3: Mary arrives, kills raiders.\n\n- Sentence4: Jack helps her.\n\n- Sentence6: Get weapons.\n\n- Sentence7: Rig crew wiped out, only Jack and Furiosa survive.\n\n- Sentence8: Haunted, Jack adopts her.\n\n- Sentence9: Rictus tries to break her out, she escapes.\n\n- Sentence10: Five Wives hide in Rig.\n\n- Sentence11: At camp, Furiosa helps Joe plan war, most of D's horde dead.\n\n- Sentence12: Joe imprisons her, makes her Imperator.\n\n- Sentence13: D's raider delivers her to D, she kills him.\n\n- Sentence14: Becomes Jack's 2nd, escapes.\n\n- Sentence15: D uses Gastown, Joe attacks, D Crucifixion (18).\n\n- Then, after, post-apocalypse.\n\n- D attacks Rig, escape (19-20).\n\n- Furiosa chases, captures D (21).\n\n- D kills Jack (22-23), Furiosa captured (24).\n\n- D sieges Citadel, repelled (25-26).\n\n- Furiosa meets wives (27).\n\n- Raiders find Green (28), she tries to leave (29).\n\n- Mary helps (30).\n\n- Furiosa goes back, can't find way, prosthetic (31).\n\n- Escapes, loses star map (32).\n\n- Mary saves her, chase (34).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct order is:\n\nStart with the fate after the Rig's crew is wiped out, then Jack adopts, then Rictus's attack, then the 40-day war, then Deme...'s plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the plot starts with Furiosa's time as a captive (sentence5), then her escaping (sentence9), then working with Jack, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to look for specific key events that should be in order.\n\n1. Furiosa's تحت تعليم someone (1)\n\n2. Working her way up (2)\n\n3. Mother comes (3)\n\n4. Jack trains her (4)\n\n5. Building the Rig (2,6): No, perhaps before Rig's crew wiped out, they built it.\n\nWait, maybe the first major point is her escape from the Horde's camp (sentence3), then gathering the Rig, going on the road, crew wiped out, Jack adopts her, Rictus tries to take her, then she becomes Imperator, kills D, which leads to D capturing her again, leading to more chase, then the final summary where she returns home.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's:\n\n1. After escaping Rictus (sentence9).\n\n2. Working with Jack: Rig built, mission to the Bullet Farm (6), Rig crew wiped out (7-8).\n\n3. Jack adopts her (7-8).\n\n4.

On Arrakis, Stilgar's Fremen troops, including Paul Atreides and his pregnant Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Jessica, overcome a Harkonnen patrol. When Jessica and Paul reach Sietch Tabr, some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the 'Outer World' will bring prosperity to Arrakis. Stilgar tells Jessica that Sietch Tabr's Reverend Mother is dying and that Jessica must succeed her by drinking the Water of Life—a poison fatal for males and untrained women. Jessica transmutes and survives the poison, inheriting the memories of all the past Reverend Mothers. The liquid also prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her; they agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy.

Paul and Chani fall in love as Paul immerses himself in Fremen culture: learning their language, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, riding a sandworm, and raiding Harkonnen spice operations. Paul adopts the Fremen names 'Usul' and 'Muad'Dib'. Due to the continuing spice raids, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen replaces his nephew, Rabban, as Arrakis's ruler with his more cunning yet psychotic younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha.

During another raid on a spice harvester, Paul reunites with Gurney Halleck, who leads Paul to the hidden atomic stockpile of House Atreides. Feyd-Rautha unleashes a devastating attack on the northern Fremen, destroying Sietch Tabr, killing Shishakli, and forcing Paul and the survivors to journey south.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so I need to help the user by rewriting a plot summary of a movie where the sentences were randomly reordered. The user has provided a list of the sentences in a jumbled order and expects the plot summary to be correctly ordered and begin with \"PLOT_SUMMARY\". \n\nFirst, I should look through the provided sentences and try to understand the narrative flow. It seems to be the plot of Dune, as it involves Paul Atreides, Jessica, Chani, Fremen, Harkonnens, and the Great Houses. The key elements to include are the betrayal by House Harkonnen, Paul's journey into the desert, his becoming the Lisan al Gaib, the prophecies, battles, and character developments.\n\nI should start by identifying the major plot points and see how they connect. For example, the initial part where Chani and Shishakli discuss the prophecy and their evolving respect for Paul. Then, moving on to Stilgar informing Jessica about Sietch Tabr's situation, which leads her to take the Water of Life and mix it with Chani's tears. This action seems important, as it plays into the prophecy and Paul's awakening.\n\nNext, the Harkonnens replacing Rabban with Feyd-Rautha, and the arrival of the Great Houses. Paul's threat to destroy the spice fields if they intervene is a pivotal moment that sets up the conflict with the other houses. \n\nJessica's journey south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists is another key point, leading to Paul adopting Fremen names. His fear of an apocalyptic holy war if he goes south, and his marriage request to Irulan with her father's condition, show his character development and the political moves he's making.\n\nThe battle against the Sardaukar with the Fremen using atomics and sandworms is a major turning point. Then, Paul uniting with Gurney Halleck and finding the atomic stockpile adds another layer to his strategic setup.\n\nFighting Feyd-Rautha in a duel, challenging Shaddam for the throne, and Paul's demands, which upset Chani, are essential plot points. Their reaction and Paul moving south to rebuild Arrakis show the progression of his leadership and the cost it incurs.\n\nStilgar leading the Fremen and Jessica using her new powers with Alia to convince Fremen of the prophecy are important for building the coalition against House Harkonnen. The attack on Arrakeen by Gurney intercepting Rabban adds more action.\n\nPaul becoming a Fedaykin and falling into a coma after drinking the Water of Life is a significant moment, leading to his visions and preparation for the future. Lady Margot evaluating Feyd-Rautha as a Kwisatz Haderach adds depth to the political aspects.\n\nFinally, Paul executing the Baron and capturing Shaddam, meeting the southern Fremen, Jessica inheriting the memories of past Reverend Mothers, the destruction of House Atreides, and Paul's vision of the future, including Alia on water-filled Arrakis, tie everything together.\n\nI need to ensure the plot summary flows logically, starting from the initial betrayal, moving through Paul's rise among the Fremen, his political and military strategies, the key battles, character developments, and the ultimate outcome of the war. I'll arrange these points in a sequence that builds upon each other, ensuring each sentence follows naturally in the telling of the story.\n\nI'll start with Chani and Shishakli's thoughts, then move to Stilgar's message to Jessica, followed by Jessica's actions and the impact on Paul. Then, bring in the Harkonnens' moves and the Great Houses' arrival. Proceeding with Jessica's journey and Paul's name change, his doubts, and his marriage proposal. The battle with the Sardaukar comes next, followed by Paul's alliance with Gurney.\n\nThen, the duel with Feyd-Rautha, the throne challenge, and Paul's demands leading to Chani's departure. Next, the Fremen victory, Stilgar's leadership, and Jessica's new abilities. Gurney's attack on Arrakeen, Paul's immersion in Fremen culture, and his fall into a coma are crucial steps. After that, Margot's evaluation of Feyd-Rautha and Paul's actions against the Harkonnens, leading to his meeting with the southern Fremen.\n\nFinally, Jessica's transmutation, the destruction of House Atreides, and Paul's visions, including the future of Arrakis. Wrapping up with the outcome of the war and Paul's return as a messiah completes the plot summary.\n\nI should make sure each sentence is placed where it adds the most to the narrative flow without seeming abrupt. Checking for connections between sentences to ensure a smooth transition. Fixing any inconsistencies and making sure all key plot points are included in order. I think this approach will help create a coherent and accurate plot summary that the user is looking for.\n",

Despite the president claiming that victory is close at hand, it is considered only a matter of time before the 'Western Forces' (WF), led by Texas and California, reach Washington, D.C. After surviving a suicide bombing in New York City, veteran war photographer Lee Smith and journalist colleague Joel meet with their mentor Sammy to share their plan to interview the isolated president. While trying to dissuade them from heading to the capital, Sammy joins them so that he can reach the frontline at Charlottesville, Virginia. The next morning, Lee finds that Joel has allowed a young aspiring photojournalist who Lee encountered at the bombing, Jessie Cullen, to join them. After departing the city, the group stops at a gas station that is protected by armed men. Jessie explores a nearby car wash, where she finds the men torturing two alleged looters. One of the guards follows Jessie, but Lee defuses the situation by taking a photo of the man posing with his victims. Later, Jessie berates herself for being too scared to take photos. When Lee has her shoot a downed helicopter, Jessie asks if Lee would photograph Jessie being killed, to which Lee responds, 'What do you think?'. Following an overnight stop near ongoing fighting, the group documents combat the next day as secessionist militiamen assault a loyalist-held building. Lee recognizes Jessie's potential as a war-photographer and begins to mentor her, while Jessie photographs the militia executing loyalist prisoners. Continuing, the group spends the night at a refugee camp before passing through a small town where, under watchful guard, residents attempt to live in blissful ignorance. Lee and Jessie grow closer, trying on clothes at a shop. They are caught in a sniper battle amid the remains of a Christmas fair. Nearby snipers mock Joel's questioning what side they are on, instead displaying a cynical kill-or-be-killed attitude. Jessie's nerve and photography skills improve as she becomes desensitized to violence. While driving, the four encounter two Hongkonger reporters who they know, Tony and Bohai. Tony and Jessie switch vehicles before Bohai drives ahead with Jessie in his car. The others catch up to find the pair held at gunpoint by unknown uniformed militia who are burying bodies in a mass grave. Against Sammy’s objection, the other three attempt to negotiate their release, but the leader of the militia executes both Bohai and Tony for not being American. The others are saved by Sammy after he rams the group's truck into members of the militia, but he is mortally wounded during the escape and dies. Traumatized, the remaining three arrive at the Charlottesville WF base. Joel learns from Lee's British reporter friend Anya that most remaining loyalists have surrendered, leaving D.C. undefended beside fanatical remnants of the armed forces and Secret Service.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I have to figure out how to correctly reorder this plot summary. Let me read through the given sentences again and see if I can identify the natural flow of the story.\n\nThe first sentence is about the remaining three traumatized people arriving at the Charlottesville WF base. That seems like the starting point. So I'll begin the plot summary with that.\n\nNext, they survived a suicide bombing in NYC, and then meet their mentor Sammy to discuss their plan. That should come after arriving at the base. \n\nThen, Lee and Jessie try on clothes, which is a character-building moment. After that, the president is faced with the upcoming Western Forces reaching Washington, so the president's speech is next.\n\nJoel stops delaying the soldiers, which is a significant action, so that should follow. Then Jessie takes photos of soldiers killing the president and posing with his corpse. That's a key event, so it's important to place it here.\n\nLee shooting a downed helicopter and Jessie asking Lee about photographing her death happens next. That shows their relationship and the risks they're taking.\n\nThen Tony and Jessie switch vehicles, and Bohai drives with Jessie. They realize it's a distraction and go inside, followed by WF soldiers. Their growing desensitization to violence is an important character development, so that comes next.\n\nExploring a car wash where they find tortured looters sets up the next action. They get caught in a sniper battle during a Christmas fair remains. Trying to negotiate their release despite Sammy's objections leads to the militia executing Bohai and Tony. That's a pivotal moment, so it should be placed here.\n\nThey continue through an abandoned building, shooting a negotiator and dealing with remaining Secret Service agents. Embedding with the WF as they assault Washington with little resistance shows the overwhelming situation. \n\nThe civil war context is established, with Jessie taking photos and Lee struggling with combat fatigue. Jessie entering the Oval Office and witnessing the president's execution is a significant plot point, so it's next.\n\nSpending the night at a refugee camp and passing through a town where people try to ignore the war sets the stage for the next phase. Snipers mock Joel, showing the chaos.\n\nLee mentors Jessie, and they photograph the militia executing prisoners. Sammy saves them by ramming the truck but dies in the process. The breach of the White House perimeter, the limousine being intercepted, and the president's quote from Lee are crucial points to follow.\n\nDeparting the city, they stop at a gas station protected by armed men. Lee takes a photo to defuse the situation, and Jessie steps into danger, forcing Lee to intervene, resulting in his death. The others find them after, leading to their capture by militia.\n\nLater, Jessie berates herself for being scared and reflects on their journey. They encounter friends Tony and Bohai, document more fighting, and the group deals with the aftermath. \n\nFinally, the group leaves, and Lee deletes a photo of his friend Anya, indicating the loss of their innings.\n\nWait, but in the initial summary, the last part is about deleting a photo, which might not be the end. Maybe I missed some points. I think I've covered all the events in order now.\n",

    "ground_truth":"Colt Seavers, a Hollywood stunt performer, works as the stunt double for famous action star Tom Ryder. However, he is severely injured during a stunt gone wrong and he abandons his career and his girlfriend Jody Moreno, a camerawoman. Eighteen months later, Colt, now a valet for a small Mexican restaurant, is contacted by Gail Meyer, Tom's film producer. She tells him that Jody is directing her first film, a science fiction epic titled Metalstorm, and wants Colt to join the production in Sydney. After arriving on set, Colt learns that Jody never asked for him and is still angry about their breakup, with the film being a less-than-subtle attempt at airing her grievances at Colt. Gail reveals that Tom has disappeared after getting into trouble with drug dealers, and she wants Colt to find him before his absence causes the already overbudget film's cancelation. Not wanting Jody's directorial debut ruined, Colt starts to track down Tom. He first goes to Tom's apartment where he is ‘attacked’ by Tom's girlfriend Iggy. She gives him a lead, so he visits a nightclub, where he meets drug dealer Doone, who tricks Colt into drinking a cocktail laced with hallucinogenic drugs. After getting into a fight with the drug dealer's goons, he visits Tom's hotel room where he finds a dead body in a bathtub full of ice. When Colt returns with the police, he finds the body has disappeared. Meanwhile, as production of Metalstorm continues, Colt and Jody begin to rekindle their relationship until Gail abruptly informs him that he must return to the United States. Instead, he continues looking for Tom by tracking down his PA Alma Milan. They are both attacked by people looking for a phone belonging to Tom in Alma's possession. Colt defeats them after an extended chase through Sydney, involving a rubbish truck. He and his longtime friend Dan Tucker, the stunt coordinator on Metalstorm, unlock the phone at Tom's apartment. They discover a video of an intoxicated Tom accidentally killing his previous stuntman Henry Herrera. The henchmen attack Colt and Dan, destroying the phone with shotgun pellets. Dan escapes, but Colt is captured and brought face-to-face with Tom, who has been hiding out on a yacht on Gail's instructions. He reveals that Gail is framing Colt for the crime using deepfake technology to replace Tom's face with Colt's on the incriminating video. Tom also reveals that he orchestrated both Colt's and Henry's ‘accidents’ over his resentment of them thinking he's cowardly for not wanting to do his own stunts. Henry's body is discovered and the doctored video is released on news media, while Gail tries to convince Jody that Colt is guilty. Colt escapes and is presumed dead after a boat chase, though he swims to safety. The next day, Tom arrives at the Metalstorm set with his goons and the production continues. Colt secretly returns to the set and convinces Jody of his innocence. Together, they trick Tom into participating in a stunt sequence and into confessing while he is wired with a lav mike. The rest of the crew, led by Dan, hold off his goons. Gail steals the recording at gunpoint and tries to escape in a helicopter with Tom, but Jody helps Colt leap onto the helicopter in mid-air. He retrieves the recording and falls onto a crash mat prepared by Dan, while the helicopter crashes with Gail and Tom in it. Metalstorm's trailer premieres at San Diego Comic-Con, with Jason Momoa replacing Tom as the lead, and the film eventually becomes a box-office hit.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, let me tackle this query. The user provided a plot summary of a movie with sentences randomly reordered and wants them reordered correctly, starting with PLOT_SUMMARY. Okay, so first, I need to figure out the correct order of the sentences. \n\nI'll read through each sentence and try to identify the sequence of events. Let me list out the sentences and then see how they might flow logically. The summary starts with henchmen attacking Colt and Dan, destroying a phone with shotgun pellets. That's the opening scene, so that should come first.\n\nNext, eighteen months later, Colt is working as a valet. That makes sense as a follow-up, so that sentence comes next. Then, Gail Meyer contacts Colt, he retrieves the recording, and there's a helicopter crash with Gail and Tom inside. That seems to follow the initial events, so I think that's the next part.\n\nThe Metalstorm trailer premiering, Jason Momoa replacing Tom, and it becoming a hit. Then a flashback where prop crew members surround Gail and Tom, Tom runs towards pyrotechnics, and he blows up. That's a key moment, so that should come after the premiere.\n\nMeanwhile, Colt and Jody start reconnecting, but Gail tells him to return to the US. Instead, Colt looks for Tom by tracking down his PA, Alma Milan. Colt is a stunt double for Tom. Then, Henry's body is found, the video is released, and Gail tries to convince Jody that Colt is guilty. She gives Colt a lead, so he goes to a nightclub, meets Doone, who drugs him. Colt defeats them in a chase with a rubbish truck. The next day, Tom arrives at the set with his goons. \n\nThey're attacked by people looking for a phone from Alma. Tom gets injured in a stunt, abandons Jody, and Colt tracks him down. Colt reveals Gail is framing him with deepfake tech. Dan escapes, Colt is captured, faces Tom, who's hiding on a yacht. Colt goes to Tom's apartment where he's 'attacked' by Iggy. Gail says Tom disappeared with drug dealers. They find a video of Tom killing Henry. Colt fights drug dealers, visits Tom's hotel, finds a dead body, gets exonerated, and reconciles with Jody.\n\nThe crew, led by Dan, holds off goons. Colt arrives on set, Jody is angry, film is a grievance movie. Colt escapes, is presumed dead, but swims away. Tom orchestrated both accidents, feeling Cowardly. Gail steals the recording, tries to escape with Tom, Jody helps Colt get on the helicopter. Colt returns, tricks Jody, they find the body is gone. They trick Tom into confessing with a wire. Colt and Dan unlock the phone. Finally, they insert the phone into the film.\n\nPutting it all together in order, starting with the initial attack, then 18 months later, the contacts and crashes. Then the trailer, flashback, reconciliation attempts, the incident at the nightclub, Tom's arrival, the phone search, Max's death, tracking Tom, the chase, the hotel room, exonerated, reconciliation with Jody, the goon attack, arriving at the set, Jody's anger, Colt escaping, presumed dead, Tom's orchestrations, Gail's plan, the helicopter escape with Colt, returning, the body gone, and finally getting the phone for evidence. That seems to flow correctly now.\n",

    "ground_truth":"Captain Eddie ‘Reaper’ Grimm, a US Air Force drone pilot, supported by Staff Sergeant Nia Branson, provides air support from a Reaper to a US Army Delta Force team sent to rescue a CIA spy in the southern Philippines. After a firefight breaks out against the Abu Sayyaf, Sergeant JJ ‘Playboy’ Kinney – a young Air Force TACP officer attached to the drone team as its JTAC – is seemingly the only survivor and is directed to an extraction point, relying only on the Reaper's remote air support. Once Kinney arrives, he is intercepted by the Abu Sayyaf, depleting the ammunition of Grimm's drone (consisting of AGM-114 Hellfire and BLU-118 rockets) and forcing the endangered extraction helicopter to leave. Trying to reach another extraction point, Kinney falls down a hill and loses his rifle, runs out of ammunition for his pistol, and then gets captured. One of his squad mates, Master Sergeant John ‘Sugar’ Sweet, turns out to be alive and rescues Kinney, while telling him Sergeant Bishop was taken prisoner in Abu Sayyaf's base in a series of caves, at their initial mission location. Using Sweet's radio, Kinney contacts Grimm, who schedules three bombings to hit the base, each 15 minutes apart, before Grimm and Branson are forced by their superiors to take a leave for having exceeded their shift. Kinney and Sweet raid one of Sayyaf's facilities before being captured and taken to their prison. Sweet is executed right as the first superficial bombing hits, and Kinney is taken to be tortured, where the rebel leader does not believe his warning about the upcoming bombings. When the bombs hit, Kinney survives due to having been dunked in a water tub, while his captors are caught in the flames. Kinney grabs a machete and kills the surviving leader, taking his satellite phone and calling Nellis Air Force Base for Grimm to call off the third bombing, before the battery runs out. The base crew, distracted by a March Madness game, dismisses Kinney's call and redirects him to Grimm's private phone. Grimm does not answer, being in a call with his very pregnant wife while grocery shopping, so Kinney leaves a voice mail, and leaves seeking the other prisoners. Returning to Bishop and searching for a way out, they also find the CIA operative, whom Grimm and Branson had been lied to that he was found elsewhere by another agency's operation. At the grocery store checkout, Grimm hears Kinney's voicemail and immediately leaves, trying to call Nellis while driving to the base. As no one answers, Grimm is forced to rush to the control room and order the B-1 Lancer pilot to abort the bombing, right as it flies in front of Kinney, Bishop, and the CIA agent reaching the cave's entrance. As the soldiers are finally extracted in the Philippines, Grimm complains to the rest of the base crew and his superiors that three men nearly died because they were too distracted to hear their calls, despite being repeatedly asked to pay attention to the phone because of his pregnant wife, and he smashes the break room's main television in anger.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I'm trying to help someone fix a plot summary of a movie where the sentences have been randomly reordered. The user wants the plot summary to be correctly ordered and started with <PLOT_SUMMARY>. Let me see what I can do here.\n\nFirst, I'll read through all the sentences to get a sense of the story. It's about a military operation, drones, some kind of rescue mission, and there are multiple characters involved like Kinney, Grimm, and others.\n\nLooking through the sentences, I think the first part should probably start with the setup, maybe introducing the main characters and the initial mission. The first sentence mentions a squad mate, Master Sergeant John ‘Sugar’ Sweet, rescuing Kinney and informing him about Sergeant Bishop being captured. That seems like a key starting point.\n\nThen, the fight breaks out against Abu Sayyaf. So after the rescue, there's a fight where Kinney is the only survivor and is directed to an extraction point with drone support. That sequence should follow the initial setup.\n\nNext, Grimm receives a call at the grocery store from Kinney's voicemail, and he leaves to call Nellis. I think that happens after the firefight, so it fits in the next part.\n\nAfter Grimm leaves, Kinney and Sweet are captured and taken to a prison. So after the fight, they get captured, which makes sense.\n\nThen, the base crew is distracted by a game, dismisses Kinney's call, and redirects him to Grimm's private line. Grimm, supported by Staff Sergeant Nia Branson, provides air support for a Delta Force team rescuing a CIA spy. This seems like a parallel action that happens while Kinney is captured.\n\nKinney uses Sweet's radio to contact Grimm, who schedules three bombings. But then Grimm and Branson are forced to take leave because of their shift. So, after Grimm agrees to the bombings, they have to leave, maybe before they can help Kinney further.\n\nThen, Grimm is not answering Kinney's call because he's talking to his wife. Kinney leaves a voice mail and continues his mission to find other prisoners. Sweet is executed during the first bombing, and Kinney is captured and tortured. The rebel leader doesn't believe his warnings about the bombings.\n\nNow, since no one is answering, Grimm is forced to go to the control room and abort the bombing as it approaches Kinney, Bishop, and the CIA agent. So that's the turning point where the bombing is called off just in time.\n\nKinney arrives at the extraction point, but the Abu Sayyaf intercept them, depleting the drone's ammo and the extraction helicopter has to leave. The bombs hit, Kinney survives because he was in a water tub, and his captors are killed by the blast.\n\nKinney then returns to Bishop and the CIA operative, who they find. Then, Grimm and Branson are in a hangar, where Nia proposes marriage. Kinney then takes a satellite phone, calls Nellis to call off the third bombing.\n\nFinally, the soldiers are extracted, Grimm is angry and confronts his superiors, smashing a TV. Kinney tries another extraction but loses his rifle, runs out of ammo, and gets captured again.\n\nPutting this all together, the correct order starts with the initial mission, the fight, Kinney being captured, Grimm's actions, the aborted bombing, Kinney's Narrow escape, the aftermath with the wedding proposal, and finally the resolution and some fallout.\n\nI need to make sure all the parts flow logically without missing any key points. Also, ensuring that the transitions between the scenes make sense in the story timeline. So the corrected plot summary should start with the squad mate rescuing Kinney and informing him about Bishop, then the fight, Grimm getting the call, the capture, the bombings, the near-miss, Kinney's survival, the extraction, the confrontation at the base, and the final attempt by Kinney to stop the third bombing.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to reorder these sentences into a coherent plot summary. The user has provided a bunch of sentences from a movie plot, but they're all jumbled up. My job is to start the summary with \"PLOT_SUMMARY:\" and arrange the sentences in the correct order. Hmm, let me read through them carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the sentences to get a better overview.\n\n1. Czech astronaut Jakub Procházka is six months into a space mission to investigate a mysterious cloud of dust and particles, called Chopra, lying beyond Jupiter.\n2. Jakub struggles with loneliness and misses his wife, Lenka, who has recently stopped talking with him after he left her and their unborn daughter behind to go on the mission.\n3.

He met Lenka, but often neglected her, being more focused on his career as a cosmonaut, going as far as leaving her when she suffered a miscarriage.\n\nAlright, let me try to structure these logically. It seems like the story starts with Jakub in space and his personal struggles. The creature Hanuš is introduced, which adds a secondary plotline. Then there's the conflict with the South Korean mission. After that, Hanuš dies, which affects Jakub. Then they reach the cloud, which has some cosmological aspect. After that, there's interaction with Lenka, some consequences of Jakub's past actions, and a resolution where he realizes his priorities.\n\nLet me try to piece them together step by step.\n\nStart with sentence 2, which introduces Jakub's situation—five months into the mission, missing his wife. Then sentence 1 shows the current mission status. Next, they talk again (sentence 3), so that comes after. Then, they explore Jakub's memories about his father, so sentence 4 comes after that. Then, the creature Hanuš is introduced, so sentence 5. Hanuš wants to help, so sentence 6, then he leaves but Jakub follows (sentence 6). \n\nThen, the Czech mission arrives, competition with South Korean (sentence 7), Hanuš returns and is dying (sentence 8). Lenka sends a message but Tuma stops it (sentence 9). Hanuš shows,jakub a memory, leading Hanус to leave (sentence 10 and 11). After that, they reach Chopra (sentence 12). Then, Jakub arranges with Peter (13), meets Lenka (14). Then, days later, spider creature (15), within the cloud, Jakub's resolution (16). Jakub is picked up (17), and the story goes back to his past with Lenka, explaining why she was upset (18).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nStart with the mission and Jakub's loneliness. Talk with Lenka, memories of his father, meet Hanус. Hanus dies after trying to help, but Jakub saves him. Then, arrive at Chopra, deal with the message, interact with Lenka, find a creature, decide to be with Lenka, and the South Korean mission picks him up. Then back to his past with Lenka, explaining why she left.\n\nLet me write this out in order to make sure the flow makes sense.\n\nPLOT_SUMMARY:\n\n1.

    "ground_truth":"12-year-old Bea moves into her grandmother Margaret's apartment in New York while her father waits for heart surgery in the same hospital where her mother died of cancer years earlier. She chafes against his playful antics, insisting she can handle the situation with maturity. One night, Bea goes out to buy a charger for her mother's old camcorder and sees an unfamiliar creature, following it back to her grandmother's building. The next day, she sees the creature again, accompanied by a man. Bea follows them to a nearby house where the man, Cal, retrieves a large furry purple creature named Blue. She also meets the other creature, a butterfly-like being named Blossom, and faints. She awakens in Cal's apartment where she learns that he has been working with imaginary friends, nicknamed IFs, to place them with new children as their original children have grown up and forgotten them. Initially reluctant, Bea eventually decides to help Cal. The next day, Cal takes Bea to Memory Lane Retirement Home, a retirement community for IFs housed underneath a swing in Coney Island. There, he introduces Bea to Lewis, an elderly teddy bear who is the head of the facility. He inspires Bea to use her imagination to redesign the facility, much to the chagrin of Cal. Bea tries to match one of the IFs with Benjamin, a young patient at the hospital. She, Cal, and Lewis audition the IFs, but he is unable to see any of them. Feeling unmotivated, Bea talks with Lewis on the Coney Island pier. He gives her an idea that maybe IFs do not need new kids, but rather to reunite with their old ones. Talking with her grandmother, she sees a picture of her as a young dancer and recognizes Blossom in the background of the picture. Realizing Blossom was her grandmother's IF, Bea decides to test Lewis' idea. Playing one of her grandmother's records inspires Margaret to dance and she remembers Blossom, instilling Bea with hope. Following a tip, Bea, Cal, and Blue find Blue's original kid, Jeremy, now a grown man trying to launch a business. By eating a fresh croissant in front of Jeremy, Bea reminds him of his childhood home above his parents' bakery; Jeremy remembers Blue enough for Blue to give Jeremy the confidence he needs for a business presentation. That evening, Bea arrives at Margaret's to find her hastily preparing for a return to the hospital because there's been a complication with her father's treatment. Bea rushes upstairs to Cal, who comforts her. When Bea says she does not want to say goodbye to her dad, Cal advises her to tell him a story instead. At the hospital, a nurse reassures Bea that her father will be all right. She tells him a story about realizing she was pushing herself to act like a grown-up when she's just a child who still needs her father. He wakes up and they reassure each other. Bea goes upstairs to thank Cal, but no one answers his door. The landlady shows Bea that the door opens into an old storage room. After her dad is released from the hospital, he and Bea pack up to go home. Bea finds an old picture she painted of herself, her parents and a clown named Calvin. She suddenly realizes that Cal is her own IF, forgotten after the death of her mother. She rushes back to see Cal, now able to see him again, and wishes him a farewell. After Bea and her father drive off, Margaret asks Blossom if the two of them should go inside, causing Blossom to realize Margaret can see her.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I've been given this task to reorder a plot summary of a movie. The user has provided a jumbled set of sentences, and my job is to piece them together in the correct order to form a coherent plot summary. They also specified that I should start the summary with <PLOT_SUMMARY>, so I need to make sure that's the opening line.\n\nFirst, I'll read through all the provided sentences to get a sense of the overall plot. The story seems to revolve around a young girl named Bea who is dealing with her father's illness and her own feelings about growing up. There are also themes of imaginary friends, some creatures, and a childhood memory involving a clown named Calvin. The main plot points seem to involve Bea encountering these creatures, trying to help her father, and dealing with the loss of her mother.\n\nI think a good approach here is to identify the chronological order of events. The beginning should set the scene with Bea moving to her grandmother's apartment, as that's where the story starts. The initial paragraph mentions her moving in while her father is in the hospital. So, that's probably the starting point.\n\nNext, Bea notices the door to an old storage room and meets Blossom, the butterfly-like creature, which causes her to faint. Then she wakes up and learns about the imaginary friends (IFs) that Cal has been working with. She becomes involved in helping reunite these IFs with their original children. There's a part where Cal suggests telling stories instead of saying goodbye, which is a key moment in their relationship.\n\nAs the story progresses, Bea meets other characters like Lewis, the elderly teddy bear, and the creature named Blue. There's a scene where she goes out to buy a charger and encounters Blue again, leading to her father being released from the hospital. Then they pack up to go home, and the next day, they visit Memory Lane Retirement Home, a place for IFs.\n\nBea realizes that Blossom was her grandmother's IF and decides to test an idea Lewis had about reuniting IFs with their original kids. She helps reunite Blue with Jeremy, a grown man. This gives Jeremy the confidence he needs for his business presentation. Finally, there's a scene where Bea is with her grandmother, and they have a heartwarming moment where Margaret dances to records and recalls Blossom, giving Bea hope.\n\nIn the end, it shows that things improve, but there's a complication in her father's treatment, so Margaret is preparing to go back to the hospital.\n\nPutting this all together, I'll need to arrange the sentences in the order they logically occur. I'll start with Bea moving in, then her encounter with the door and Blossom, followed by her learning about IFs and helping her father. Then, she meets other characters, reunites IFs, eventually helps with Blue, and ends on a hopeful note, with a hint that there's more to come due to the complication with her father's treatment.\n\nI should also ensure that each sentence flows into the next without jumping too abruptly. Maybe I can group the initial settings, then the测试和故事发展.中间部分,最后是高潮部分。\n\nPotential challenges here might be making sure that the order of events is correct, especially when there are subplots like the IFs and their reunions. I need to ensure that the meetings with each character (Benjamin, Lewis, Blue) are in the right sequence.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the emotional arc of Bea's character. She starts off confused and perhapssad, then becomes more responsible and eventually hopeful. So the plot should reflect her personal growth.\n\nI think creating a list of events in order and then mapping them onto the sentences should work. Alternatively, I can look for key phrases that indicate the flow of time, like \"next day\" or \"after that,\" to help in ordering.\n\nAlso, some sentences mention specific places like Memory Lane Retirement Home and Coney Island, which could serve as markers for the progression of the plot.\n\nI should also watch out for repetition or redundancy. For example, there might be moments where the same place is mentioned more than once, so placing them in the correct chronological order would make the summary seamless.\n\nIn summary, my plan is to:\n\n1. Identify the starting point: Bea moving into her grandmother's apartment.\n2. Follow the events in the order they occur naturally: meeting Blossom, learning about IFs, helping Cal, meeting other characters, reuniting IFs, etc.\n3. Ensure the emotional and plot progression make sense, showing growth in Bea's character and the development of the IFs' reconcilement.\n4. Pay attention to key phrases indicating time and place to maintain coherence.\n5. Write the summary with each sentence following the previous one without abrupt jumps, maintaining a narrative flow.\n\nBy methodically going through each sentence and placing them in the most logical order, I can reconstruct a coherent plot summary that accurately reflects the original story.\n",
    "filtered_answer":"\n\n<PLOT_SUMMARY>\n\n12-year-old Bea moves into her grandmother Margaret's apartment in New York while her father waits for heart surgery in the same hospital where her mother died of cancer years earlier. Bea notices a door leading to an old storage room where she meets Blossom, a butterfly-like creature, and faints from the encounter. She awakens to learn that her father, Cal, has been working with imaginary friends called IFs, helping them reunite with children who have forgotten them after growing up. Bea visits Cal in his apartment and learns about the IFs, including Benjamin, a young patient at the hospital.\n\nBea chafes against Cal's playful antics, insisting she can handle things more maturely, but later finds an old picture she painted of herself, her parents, and a clown named Calvin. To help Cal, she and her father audit the IFs, though Cal initially can't see them. Bea aids Cal in an idea that IFs may not need new children but rather to reunite with their old ones.\n\nThe next day, Bea and her father drive off, and Margaret asks Blossom if they should go inside, causing Blossom to realize Margaret can see her. One night, Bea buys a charger for her mother's camcorder and sees an unfamiliar creature, following it to her grandmother's building. There, she meets Lewis, an elderly teddy bear who is the facility's head. Bea goes upstairs to thank Cal, but no one answers his door.\n\nAt the hospital, a nurse reassures Bea that her father will be okay. Bea tries to match an IF with Benjamin, a young patient, inspiring her to redesign the facility to her liking, much to Cal's chagrin. Reluctantly, Bea decides to help Cal. After her dad is released, they pack up to go home.\n\nThe next day, Cal takes Bea to Memory Lane Retirement Home, a community for IFs under a Coney Island swing. Realizing Blossom was her grandmother's IF, Bea tests Lewis' idea. Bea, Cal, and Blue find Jeremy, Blue's original kid, a grown man trying to launch a business. By reminding Jeremy of his childhood home, Bea gives Jeremy the confidence needed for his presentation.\n\nTalking with her grandmother, Bea sees a photo of herself as a young dancer and recognizes Blossom in the background. That evening, Margaret prepares to return to the hospital due to a complication in her father's treatment.\n\n<PLOT_SUMMARY>",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to help the user fix this plot summary of a movie by correctly ordering the sentences. Let me read through the provided sentences carefully to understand the chronological order.\n\nThe user provided a list of 21 sentences that have been randomly reordered. The task is to arrange them in the correct sequence to form a coherent plot summary. The summary should start with \"PLOT_SUMMARY:\" followed by the ordered sentences.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the sentences again for clarity:\n\n1. The film ends as Marley and his band gear up to perform again for the Jamaican crowd with the song ‘One Love’.\n2. After performing, Marley, saddened that his own countrymen would try to kill him and his wife, shows the crowd his bullet wounds before walking off stage.\n3. After Marley debuts a song to Rita and the children about reconciliation, she finally deems him ready to perform a peace concert.\n4. A pre-credits montage shows clips of the real Marley and his band during the One Love Peace Concert, which sees them joined on-stage by the heads of both of Jamaica's political parties, also revealing that Marley and his band were able to perform in Zimbabwe to celebrate the nation's independence before he died of his cancer in 1981 at the age of 36.\n5. Marley also gets into an alteration with manager Don Taylor over a financial dispute.\n6. After a toenail infection raises concern from Rita and his record producer Chris Blackwell, Marley is later diagnosed with a rare skin cancer.\n7. Back home, the gunman who had shot him and the others arrives and begs for forgiveness, to which Marley states he ‘keeps no vengeance’.\n8. He tells Rita to take their children to Delaware in the United States and stay with his mom, as he and the rest of his band venture to London.\n9. In 1976, amidst armed political conflict that is affecting daily life in Jamaica, Bob Marley announces he will perform at a concert, Smile Jamaica, promoting peace amongst the warring factions.\n10. Blackwell confronts Marley about treatment choices, reluctantly dismissed by a firm Marley.\n11. While preparing for the concert, Marley, his wife Rita, and several other members of his band are shot by assailants.\n12. After struggling to come up with a new album concept, Marley asks Rita to rejoin him and the band in England, and taking inspiration from the soundtrack of the film Exodus and their own situation, he and the band begin recording what would become their album of the same name.\n13. This leads to friction with Rita as she and Marley argue about his responsibilities and both his and Rita's infidelities, in addition to having given up on promoting peace back in Jamaica.\n14. When the recording company schedules a tour in Europe, Marley also aims for stops throughout Africa to inspire the people there.\n15. Faced with his own mortality, Marley reconciles with Rita and Taylor and finally decides to return to Jamaica in 1978, where he is welcomed back by a crowd at the airport.\n16. Rita and Marley are hospitalized, but survive and recover from their injuries in time for the concert.\n17. The album becomes a hit and helps further popularize reggae music and the Rastafari movement around the world.\n\nNow, I need to arrange these sentences in order. The first sentence is probably the end of the movie, so the starting point would be before that. Let me think about the timeline.\n\nThe film probably starts with Marley's rise to fame, then his conflicts, the shooting incident, his death, and then perhaps the aftermath or a reconstruction of his legacy. Wait, but some sentences mention events after his death, like the pre-credits montage showing concerts he participated in before he died, which would be a flashforward.\n\nSo, the movie might open with a scene from his last concert, which is the One Love Peace Concert. That would be a pre-credits montage, so sentence 4 mentions that. Then, after that, the main plot begins.\n\nWait, but sentence 1 says the film ends with Marley and his band performing again. Hmm, maybe the film starts with the pre-credits montage and then goes into the main story, ending with the same concert.\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let me think again. If the film ends with the concert, then the pre-credits montage would be at the beginning, showing his 1981 concert, his death, and perhaps other events. Then, the main story would follow, showing his life from 1976 onwards, leading up to the concert where he was shot and survived, and later held another peace concert.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct order is: The movie starts with the pre-credits montage showing his 1981 concert, then the main story begins in 1976, showing his concert, the shooting, his diagnosis, the move to London, recording the album, the friction with Rita, the tour, his reconciliation, returning to Jamaica, the concert, and ending with the same concert that's shown earlier.\n\nWait, but the user's sentences include both the pre-credits montage (sentence 4) and the end of the movie (sentence 1), so I need to see how they connect.\n\nLet me outline possible timeline points:\n\n- The movie ends with Marley performing at a peace concert, so that would be the final scene. Before that, he faces conflicts, including the shooting, his treatments, recording an album, etc.\n\nSo, historical timeline based on the sentences:\n\n- 1976: Marley announces a concert (sentence 9)\n- That concert is Smile Jamaica (sentence 9)\n- While preparing, he and his team are shot (sentence 11)\n- After that, he goes to England, records an album (sentences 12, 14)\n- There's friction with Rita (sentence 13)\n- Faces mortality, reconciles, returns to Jamaica in 1978 (sentence 15)\n- They survive and have a concert (sentence 16)\n- The album (Exodus) becomes a hit (sentence 17)\n- The film ends with him performing 'One Love' (sentence 1)\n\nNow, let's see when the pre-credits montage happens. It's a pre-credits scene showing his 1981 concert, his death, and other concerts. But if the main story goes up to 1978, then the pre-credits montage would actually come after the main story? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the movie starts with the pre-credits montage, which is a historical recap, then the main plot begins in 1976, leading up to the Smile Jamaica concert, the shooting, etc., and the final scene shows the peace concert, with the pre-credits montage at the very beginning, showing his last concert before his death.\n\nI think sentence 4 should come near the beginning as the pre-credits montage. So, arrange the sentences starting from before the Smile Jamaica concert, leading up to the shooting, then the album recording, and leading to the final peace concert.\n\nLet me try to order them logically. Let's list them in order:\n\n- 1976: Announces Smile Jamaica (9)\n- Blows off Blackwell's advice (10)\n- Preparing the concert, shot (11)\n-.struggles to record album (12)\n- Recording Exodus (12), friction with Rita (13)\n- Tour plans, including Africa (14)\n- Faces mortality, reconciles, returns to Jamaica 1978 (15)\n- They survive, prepare the concert (16)\n- Album hits, popularizes reggae (17)\n- The film ends with Marley performing at the peace concert (1)\n\nBut wait, the pre-credits montage (4) comes at the beginning, showing the 1981 concert when he died. So that would be before the main story, which starts at 1976.\n\nWait, maybe the order is:\n\n- Pre-credits: montage of his concerts, including Zimbabwe and the One Love concert where he dies (4)\n- Main story starts in 1976 at the Smile Jamaica concert (9)\n- Then, the shooting (11)\n- Asylum in England, recording Exodus (12)\n- Friction with Rita (13)\n- Tour plans (14)\n- Reconciliation, returns to Jamaica in 1978 (15)\n- Survives the shooting, organizes the concert (16)\n- Album success (17)\n- Film ends with the peace concert, showing Marley and Rita performing (1)\n\nSo the sentences would be arranged in the order: 4,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,1.\n\nWait, but I have to include all sentences, not just the main points.\n\nLet me piece it together more carefully.\n\nStart with the pre-credits montage (4). Then, in 1976, a Smile Jamaica concert (9). Then, Blackwell confronts him (10). Then, preparing for the concert, they get shot (11). Struggling with the album (12). Recording Exodus (12), friction with Rita (13). Marley plans a tour, including Africa (14). Faced with mortality, reconciles and returns to Jamaica in 1978 (15). They survive the shooting (16). Album hit (17). Film ends with them performing (1).\n\nWait, but how does the shooting happen after the Smile Jamaica concert, then after that, he goes to England and records the album.\n\nAlternatively, after the Smile Jamaica concert, which he survives, he then goes to England, records the album with Rita, but they have friction, then plans a tour, faces his mortality, returns to Jamaica in '78, etc., leading to the final peace concert.\n\nSo the order of events would be:\n\n4 (pre-credits montage: his 1981 concert, which is a key point at the end of his life)\n9 (1976, Marley announces Smile Jamaica concert)\n10 (Blackwell confronts about treatment)\n11 (they get shot at the Smile Jamaica concert)\n12 (Marley records Exodus after the shooting)\n13 (friction with Rita)\n14 (tour planned)\n15 (reconciliation, return to Jamaica in '78)\n16 (survive the shooting and prepare the peace concert)\n17 (album success)\n1 (film ends with Marley performing at the peace concert)\n\nYes, that seems to make sense.\n\nSo, the correct order would start with 4, then go through 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17, and then end with 1.\n\nWait, but the sentences need to be in order without skipping any. Let me list all sentences in the order that they should be read.\n\nStarting with 4 (pre-credits montage), then 9 (1976), 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,17, and end with 1.\n\nSo, the correct sequence is:\n\n4. A pre-credits montage shows clips of the real Marley and his band during the One Love Peace Concert...\n\n9. In 1976, amidst armed political conflict that is affecting daily life in Jamaica, Bob Marley announces he will perform at a concert, Smile Jamaica...\n\n10. Blackwell confronts Marley about treatment choices, reluctantly dismissed by a firm Marley.\n\n11. While preparing for the concert, Marley, his wife Rita, and several other members of his band are shot by assailants.\n\n12. After struggling to come up with a new album concept, Marley asks Rita to rejoin him and the band in England...\n\n13. This leads to friction with Rita as she and Marley argue about his responsibilities and both his and Rita's infidelities...\n\n14. When the recording company schedules a tour in Europe, Marley also aims for stops throughout Africa...\n\n15.

Rita and Marley are hospitalized, but survive and recover from their injuries in time for the concert.\n\n17. The album becomes a hit and helps further popularize reggae music...\n\nThen, the final scene is 1. The film ends as Marley and his band gear up to perform again for the Jamaican crowd...\n\nSo, putting it all together, the sentences in order are: 4,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,1.\n\nI think that's correct.\n",

    "ground_truth":"Three years after the events in Summerville, Oklahoma, Callie Spengler, her boyfriend Gary Grooberson, her children Trevor and Phoebe, and their close friends Lucky Domingo and Podcast, relocate to New York City to aid Winston Zeddemore and Ray Stantz in reestablishing the Ghostbusters. After the group captures a ghost in Hell's Kitchen, Walter Peck, the Ghostbusters' long-time opponent, threatens to close them down with his authority as mayor. To appease him, Callie removes underage Phoebe from the team. Upset, Phoebe attempts to control her emotions by playing chess in a nearby park, where she encounters and befriends Melody, the ghost of a teenage girl who died in a fire. Meanwhile, Ray and Podcast are collecting cursed objects for examination. Nadeem Razmaadi visits and sells them a strange brass orb with ritual markings inherited from his grandmother. Ray suspects it is an apotropaic trap. When he tests its PKE levels, the orb immediately emits broad-spectrum telekinetic energy. A frosty wave travels from the orb to the Ghostbusters' firehouse headquarters and damages the ecto-containment unit, which is dangerously near capacity. Winston takes the orb to his privately owned paranormal research center, run by Dr. Lars Pinfield. Using an experimental extraction device, Lars is unable to extract any spiritual energy from the orb. To learn more, he joins Trevor and Lucky to see Nadeem, who reveals that the orb was kept hidden by his grandmother within a brass-lined chamber. Peter Venkman, brought in to help, discovers Nadeem has latent pyrokinetic powers. Meanwhile, Ray, accompanied by Phoebe and Podcast, visits Dr. Hubert Wartzki, a New York Public Library research librarian. Wartzki explains the orb was built millennia ago by four sorcerers called the Firemasters to imprison Garraka, a phantom god who sought to conquer the world with an undead army who would use ‘Kusharit Umoti’ - ‘the power to kill by fear itself.’ They learn Nadeem's grandmother belonged to the lineage of Firemasters, one of whom prevented Garraka from escaping the orb in 1904 during a mock ritual conducted by members of the Manhattan Adventurers' Society, whom Garraka froze to death. Garraka was confined in the orb due to being vulnerable to copper alloys combined with fire and lacking his devil horns which augment his powers. When the trio attempt to stop a ghost from stealing a phonographic recording of the club's ritual, Peck exploits Phoebe's involvement to shut down the Ghostbusters. After an argument with Gary and her mother, Phoebe runs away and takes Melody to Winston's research center. She uses his extraction equipment to project herself as a ghost for two minutes so the pair can physically interact. Melody reveals she had been secretly working with Garraka, who has offered her passage to the afterlife. By controlling Phoebe's disembodied spirit, Garraka forces her physical body to recite the ritual chant. He then escapes, locates his horns and begins freezing the city. Realizing Garraka will free the ghosts in the containment unit, the Ghostbusters gather to defend their headquarters, aided by Nadeem, who dons the Firemaster brass armor kept by his grandmother and attempts to master his powers. Garraka overpowers them and breaches the containment unit. Phoebe reconfigures her proton pack with copper alloys to strengthen it; Melody, betrayed by Garraka, atones by helping Nadeem utilize his powers to weaken Garraka. Ray, with help from his fellow veteran Ghostbusters, entraps the god by improvising the ruptured containment unit as a giant trap. Melody reconciles with Phoebe before departing for the afterlife to reunite with her family. As the city thaws, the Ghostbusters are hailed as heroes, with Peck forced to support the team and reinstate Phoebe. The Ghostbusters begin pursuing escaped ghosts across New York City.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user has provided a query where a movie plot summary has had its sentences randomly reordered. The task is to reorder them correctly. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the plot. Looking at the jumbled sentences, I can see they cover various aspects of the story: initial setup, conflicts, character interactions, and the climax. My goal is to reconstruct these in a logical sequence.\n\nI'll start by identifying key plot points. The first sentence mentions Wartksi explaining the orb's origin, so that should probably be the opening. Next, introducing the characters and immediate conflicts make sense—Walter Peck threatening the Ghostbusters, Garraka breaching containment.\n\nThen, moving into character development: Phoebe's argument and her actions, Callie's involvement, Melody's role. These seem to occur after the initial breach, so they might come next.\n\nAfter that, the group trying to stop Garraka and using the orb would follow. Then, introducing Nadeem and his grandmother's role adds depth, likely in the middle of the story.\n\nWinston's actions with the orb, interactions with other characters like Melody and the resolution of Phoebe's situation should come next. The appearance of Peter Venkman introduces a familiar face, so that should be later on.\n\nThe climax with the containment unit and Nadeem's role as Firemaster probably wraps up the main conflict. The epilogue after the credits shows the aftermath and hints at a new threat, which is typical.\n\nI also notice some mid-credits scenes, so those should be placed appropriately towards the end. The final scene shows the Ghostbusters being hailed as heroes, which ties everything together.\n\nI need to ensure a chronological order, so each part flows logically into the next. It's important to maintain the sequence of events without jumping around. Also, making sure to include all main plot points without missing any crucial details.\n\nAs I reconstruct, I'll check if each sentence matches the previous context. For instance, after introducing the orb, the Ghostbusters' response and interactions make sense. Then the discovery of Nadeem's role and the use of the orb to stop Garraka would follow naturally.\n\nI should also pay attention to character relationships, like Melody's betrayal and reconciliation. These personal elements add depth and should be placed in the correct order to develop the story effectively.\n\nFinally, the epilogue and post-credit scenes should be at the very end to wrap up the story and tease future events, as is common in many movie franchises.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll arrange the sentences in a sequence that tells the story from beginning to end, ensuring each part flows smoothly into the next. This way, the plot summary becomes coherent and engaging.\n",

    "ground_truth":"Many generations after Caesar's death, apes have established numerous clans, while most humans have become feral-esque. Noa, a young chimpanzee from a falconry-practicing clan, prepares for a coming-of-age ceremony by collecting eagle eggs with his friends Anaya and Soona. However, a human scavenger follows Noa home and inadvertently cracks his egg during a scuffle before fleeing. While searching for a replacement egg, Noa encounters a group of ape raiders using electric weapons. As Noa hides from them, the apes follow his horse back to his clan. Noa hurries home to find his village burning; the raider leader Sylva kills Noa's father before dropping Noa from a high platform. Left for dead, Noa awakens, discovering that his clan has been abducted. He buries his father and sets out to rescue his clan. On his journey, he is joined by Raka, an orangutan who tells Noa about Caesar's teachings. The apes notice they are being followed by the human scavenger; Raka offers her food and a blanket, naming her Nova. When the trio encounters a group of feral humans, Sylva's raiders suddenly attack. Noa and Raka rescue Nova who, to their surprise, can speak. She reveals that her name is Mae and that the raiders took Noa's clan to a beachfront settlement outside an old human vault. As they cross a bridge on their way to the settlement, they are ambushed by Sylva. In the ensuing fight, Raka saves Mae from drowning but is swept away by the rapids. Noa and Mae are captured and taken to the apes' settlement. Noa reunites with his clan and is introduced to the apes' self-proclaimed king, Proximus Caesar. Proximus has enslaved other clans, forcing them to work on opening the vault so he can access the human technology locked inside. Proximus invites Noa to dinner along with Mae and Trevathan, a human prisoner who is teaching Proximus about the old human world. Proximus believes that Noa's intelligence could help open the vault and warns him that Mae only has her own agenda. Noa confronts Mae, demanding the truth in exchange for his help. Mae discloses knowledge of a hidden entrance to the vault and says that a mysterious ‘book’ capable of restoring speech to humanity is inside. Noa agrees to help her enter the vault, hoping to destroy Proximus' settlement and lead his clan back home. Noa, Mae, Soona, and Anaya secretly plant explosives around the levee that surrounds the settlement. Trevathan catches them and intends to warn Proximus, but Mae kills him. The group enters the vault, which is a military bunker housing a stockpile of weapons and Mae's 'book', which is actually a deciphering key for a satellite. The apes discover old picture books depicting humans as the once-dominant species and apes in cages at a zoo. As the group makes their way out of the bunker, they are confronted by Proximus and his tribe. Lightning, one of Proximus's apes threatens to kill Soona, but Mae kills him with a gun she found. Proximus tells Mae that she can leave if she tells him where the other weapons are. Mae refuses and triggers the explosives, flooding the bunker with the apes inside. Mae flees the settlement while the apes climb to higher ground through the bunker. Noa is pursued by Sylva, but Noa traps and drowns him. Noa escapes the bunker with his clan, but Proximus attacks him. Noa leads his clan in summoning their eagles to attack Proximus and send him falling off a cliff into the sea. As Noa's clan returns to rebuild their home, Mae arrives to bid farewell to Noa, concealing a gun behind her back but never revealing or using it. She explains that she destroyed the bunker and prevented the apes from accessing the weapons in the bunker because those weapons were created by humans and should only be used by humans. Noa then argues that if weapons and technology are only for humans, it suggests that nothing belongs to the apes, questioning whether apes and humans can coexist peacefully given Mae's fundamental disparity. As Noa takes Soona to look through a telescope he found on his journey, Mae travels to a human settlement at a satellite base, which is kept quarantined from the outside world. Mae delivers the decipher key, allowing the humans to reactivate the satellites and successfully contact other humans worldwide.",

The group enters the vault, which is a military bunker housing a stockpile of weapons and Mae's 'book', which is actually a deciphering key for a satellite. Many generations after Caesar's death, apes have established numerous clans, while most humans have become feral-esque. Noa leads his clan in summoning their eagles to attack Proximus and send him falling off a cliff into the sea. Left for dead, Noa awakens, discovering that his clan has been abducted. Proximus invites Noa to dinner along with Mae and Trevathan, a human prisoner who is teaching Proximus about the old human world. Trevathan catches them and intends to warn Proximus, but Mae kills him. When the trio encounters a group of feral humans, Sylva's raiders suddenly attack. However, a human scavenger follows Noa home and inadvertently cracks his egg during a scuffle before fleeing. Mae delivers the decipher key, allowing the humans to reactivate the satellites and successfully contact other humans worldwide. Lightning, one of Proximus's apes threatens to kill Soona, but Mae kills him with a gun she found. Mae flees the settlement while the apes climb to higher ground through the bunker. Proximus believes that Noa's intelligence could help open the vault and warns him that Mae only has her own agenda. Proximus has enslaved other clans, forcing them to work on opening the vault so he can access the human technology locked inside. She reveals that her name is Mae and that the raiders took Noa's clan to a beachfront settlement outside an old human vault. Noa is pursued by Sylva, but Noa traps and drowns him. Mae refuses and triggers the explosives, flooding the bunker with the apes inside. Noa and Raka rescue Nova who, to their surprise, can speak. He buries his father and sets out to rescue his clan. Noa then argues that if weapons and technology are only for humans, it suggests that nothing belongs to the apes, questioning whether apes and humans can coexist peacefully given Mae's fundamental disparity. Noa escapes the bunker with his clan, but Proximus attacks him. Noa reunites with his clan and is introduced to the apes' self-proclaimed king, Proximus Caesar. Noa agrees to help her enter the vault, hoping to destroy Proximus' settlement and lead his clan back home. Proximus tells Mae that she can leave if she tells him where the other weapons are. As they cross a bridge on their way to the settlement, they are ambushed by Sylva. Noa hurries home to find his village burning; the raider leader Sylva kills Noa's father before dropping Noa from a high platform. As Noa's clan returns to rebuild their home, Mae arrives to bid farewell to Noa, concealing a gun behind her back but never revealing or using it. While searching for a replacement egg, Noa encounters a group of ape raiders using electric weapons. The apes discover old picture books depicting humans as the once-dominant species and apes in cages at a zoo. Noa, Mae, Soona, and Anaya secretly plant explosives around the levee that surrounds the settlement. She explains that she destroyed the bunker and prevented the apes from accessing the weapons in the bunker because those weapons were created by humans and should only be used by humans. Noa and Mae are captured and taken to the apes' settlement. On his journey, he is joined by Raka, an orangutan who tells Noa about Caesar's teachings. The apes notice they are being followed by the human scavenger; Raka offers her food and a blanket, naming her Nova. As the group makes their way out of the bunker, they are confronted by Proximus and his tribe.",
    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I have this problem where a movie plot summary's sentences have been jumbled, and I need to reorder them correctly. The task is to start the plot summary with \"PLOT_SUMMARY:\" and arrange the sentences in the correct order. Let me read through the given sentences and try to figure out the sequence.\n\nFirst, the sentences describe a movie involving apes, humans, and some key plot points. The main characters seem to be Noa, Mae, and others. From what I can piece together, there's a fight, some rescues, and the use of a book or key to restore something. There are also mentions of clans, a vault, and some conflict between groups.\n\nI'll start by identifying the beginning of the story. The first sentence mentions Noa preparing for a coming-of-age ceremony, so perhaps that's the starting point. Then, the next part where Noa and friends collect eggs sets the scene with their clans and eagles. \n\nNext, I see a transition where an ape saves a human, which probably leads to conflict and hiding. Then, Noa confronts Mae, who gives information about a hidden entrance to a vault with a key. This seems like a crucial plot point where the group enters the vault and finds the key.\n\nAfter that, there's a part where Noa forms an alliance with Mae to act against Proximus, where Proximus is a leader with his own agenda. The group plans to destroy Proximus's settlement. \n\nThere's a subplot where Soona, the baby, is being targeted, and Mae protects her. Proximus and his tribe take action, leading to a confrontation where the vault is activated, causing a flood, and Noa rescues Soona, who turns out to be able to speak.\n\nMae and Noa then escape with Soona and Raka, but they face more threats, including Sylva's raiders and a human scavenger. The climax involves using the key to reactivate satellites, contact other humans, and defeat Proximus. Noa questions the coexistence of apes and humans, leading to a resolution where they rebuild their home.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the correct order is: starting with the ceremony, then the fight, revealing the key, the alliance, the fight against Proximus, the rescue, the use of the key, and the resolution. I'll arrange the sentences accordingly, ensuring each part logically follows the previous one without repetition or gaps.\n",
    "filtered_answer":"\n\nPLOT_SUMMARY: Noa, a young chimpanzee from a falconry-practicing clan, prepares for a coming-of-age ceremony by collecting eagle eggs with his friends Anaya and Soona.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so I've got this query where the user provided a plot summary of a movie, but the sentences have been randomly reordered. They want me to fix the order so the summary makes sense. Hmm, okay. Let me read through the jumbled sentences carefully to figure out the right sequence.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main story arcs. The mention of \"The Chameleon\" and character names like Po, Zhen, Ping, Li, etc., suggests this is likely the Kung Fu Panda series, maybe the third movie. The key moments I can spot are the initial escape, training someone to take Po's place, a battle with The Chameleon, and Po dealing with succession issues. \n\nLooking at the sentences, the beginning part where Po and Zhen escape to the Den of Thieves seems early on. So I'll start with that. Then Po returns to the Valley but is betrayed, which sets up the conflict. Zhen helps him, they face the Chameleon, and eventually Po has to choose a successor.\n\nMidway, there's a part about Po and Zhen entering a tavern and Juniper City, leading to the climax where Po defeats The Chameleon but Zhen turns out to be a traitor. Finally, Po chooses Zhen as his successor despite Shifu's objections. That makes sense as the conclusion.\n\nPutting it all together, it seems the correct order starts with their adventure, progresses into the conflict with The Chameleon, and ends with the resolution and Po making a tough choice. I'll rearrange the sentences following this flow to create a coherent summary.\n",

    "ground_truth":"Three years after defeating Mechagodzilla, Kong has established his new territory in the Hollow Earth and searches for more of his kind. On Earth's surface, Godzilla continues to maintain order between humanity and giant monsters, known as ‘Titans’ — killing Titan Scylla in Rome and resting in the Colosseum afterwards. A Monarch observation outpost stationed in Hollow Earth picks up an unidentified signal. On the surface, the signal causes Jia, the last known survivor of the Iwi tribe from Skull Island, to experience hallucinations and visions, causing her adoptive mother and Kong expert, Dr. Ilene Andrews, to worry. Also sensing the signal, Godzilla leaves Rome and attacks a nuclear plant in France to absorb radiation. He then heads to the lair of the Titan Tiamat in the Arctic. Monarch believes Godzilla is strengthening himself for an oncoming threat. When a sinkhole opens near his home, Kong discovers an uncharted realm where a tribe of his species has survived, including a juvenile named Suko. After a brief initial confrontation, Kong convinces Suko to lead him to the tribe's lair, and the two slowly bond on their journey. The tribe's tyrannical leader, Skar King, battles Kong with the aid of an ancient ice-powered Titan, Shimo, whom he controls with pain using a crystal. Shimo's ice breath injures Kong's right arm, causing frostbite, but with Suko's help, Kong manages to escape after losing his axe. Andrews and Jia, alongside Titan veterinarian Trapper and conspiracy podcaster Bernie Hayes, travel to Hollow Earth to locate the source of the signal. They find the Monarch outpost destroyed. As the group follows the signal, they discover a temple that leads them to a subterranean section that houses a surviving Iwi tribe, who communicate telepathically with each other, living beneath portals to the surface. Inspecting some ruins, they surmise that the signal was a telepathic distress call sent by the Iwi. While observing Jia socializing with the Iwi, Andrews voices her fears to Trapper that Jia may choose to stay with her people and that Andrews would have to accept it. Inside a temple, Andrews uncovers hieroglyphics displaying the past and future: Skar King once attempted to conquer the surface world, forced Shimo to trigger an ice age, and waged war against Godzilla's species, but Godzilla defeated him by trapping him and his tribe deep within Hollow Earth. The prophecy also indicates that Jia would be the key to reawakening Mothra. Sensing Jia, Kong locates the temple and is fitted by Trapper with a prototype exoskeletal glove to strengthen and heal his frostbitten limb. Unknown to them, one of Skar King's loyalists follows them and informs him that the protective barrier leading to the surface portals has been opened. Jia successfully awakens the reborn Mothra. Meanwhile, Godzilla kills Tiamat and absorbs cosmic radiation from her lair, which turns his dorsal plates magenta. Hoping to lure Godzilla to Hollow Earth to assist him, Kong surfaces in Cairo and calls out to Godzilla. Despite Kong's attempts to communicate, Godzilla attacks him, and a brief fight ensues until Mothra intervenes. Godzilla, Kong, and Mothra return to the Hollow Earth and engage Skar King and Shimo in battle. Skar King and Shimo manage to use one of the portals to escape to the surface, forcing Godzilla and Kong to chase them to Rio de Janeiro, and Shimo induces a second ice age at Skar King's command. The factions are evenly matched until Suko arrives with Kong's axe and destroys the crystal controlling Shimo. Shimo freezes Skar King before Kong shatters him to pieces. After undoing Shimo's ice age with his atomic breath, Godzilla returns to rest in the Colosseum. Jia reunites with Andrews and alleviates her fears by choosing to stay with her adopted mother. Mothra restores the protective barrier of the Iwi's home and the portals. Kong returns with Shimo and Suko to Hollow Earth, where he becomes the ape tribe's new leader.",

The tribe's tyrannical leader, Skar King, battles Kong with the aid of an ancient ice-powered Titan, Shimo, whom he controls with pain using a crystal. Inside a temple, Andrews uncovers hieroglyphics displaying the past and future: Skar King once attempted to conquer the surface world, forced Shimo to trigger an ice age, and waged war against Godzilla's species, but Godzilla defeated him by trapping him and his tribe deep within Hollow Earth. Also sensing the signal, Godzilla leaves Rome and attacks a nuclear plant in France to absorb radiation. Shimo's ice breath injures Kong's right arm, causing frostbite, but with Suko's help, Kong manages to escape after losing his axe. Shimo freezes Skar King before Kong shatters him to pieces. He then heads to the lair of the Titan Tiamat in the Arctic. Unknown to them, one of Skar King's loyalists follows them and informs him that the protective barrier leading to the surface portals has been opened. Sensing Jia, Kong locates the temple and is fitted by Trapper with a prototype exoskeletal glove to strengthen and heal his frostbitten limb. On the surface, the signal causes Jia, the last known survivor of the Iwi tribe from Skull Island, to experience hallucinations and visions, causing her adoptive mother and Kong expert, Dr. Kong returns with Shimo and Suko to Hollow Earth, where he becomes the ape tribe's new leader.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a plot summary from a movie, but the sentences are randomly reordered. The task is to rewrite the summary with the correct order, starting with \"PLOT_SUMMARY:\".\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the plot. It seems like the story is set in a world with giant monsters called Titans, and Godzilla is maintaining order. There are multiple characters: Godzilla, Kong, Mothra, and humans involved. The outline mentions adventures in Hollow Earth, interactions with the Iwi tribe, battles with other Titans, and some kind of prophecy involving Jia and Mothra.\n\nI should read through each sentence and note where each fits logically. The story starts with Mothra restoring a barrier, then moves to a Monarch outpost detecting a signal. Godzilla is dealing with a Titan (Scylla) in Rome. Then, Godzilla, Kong, and Mothra go back to Hollow Earth to fight Skar King and Shimo, only to find the outpost destroyed.\n\nAfter that, Kong and Suko travel to the tribe's lair and bond. Meanwhile, humans with Trapper and Bernie are searching for the signal. Kong tries to get Godzilla's help but is attacked. They find the temple and realize it's a distress call from the Iwi.\n\nThe story progresses as they rescue Jia and find the Iwi tribe. The prophecy about Jia waking Mothra comes into play. There's a battle with Skar King and Shimo escaping, leading Godzilla and Kong to Rio. Shimo induces an ice age, which is reversible with Godzilla's breath.\n\nThen, Suko helps Kong recover, they battle Shimo, and encounter Tiamat, who Godzilla defeats but absorbs radiation. This changes Godzilla's appearance. Kong finds a lost tribe of his kind, and there's a confrontation with Skar King, who is defeated by Kong and Shimo.\n\nAndrews uncovers the history of Skar King in the temple. The signal affects Jia, causing visions, and Mothra is reborn. The end shows Kong leading the ape tribe and Jia awakening Mothra.\n\nI need to connect these points in the correct order, ensuring each sentence follows the previous events logically. Building the timeline step-by-step will help reorder them correctly. It's important to identify key events that set up the story, the rising action, and the climax where Mothra is reborn.\n\nI might group the events by setting: first, the initial confrontations, then the discovery of the signal and the Iwi tribe, followed by the battles and the final confrontation with Skar King and the ice age. Finally, the resolution where Mothra is awakened and the new status quo is established.\n\nBy structuring it this way, I can weave the sentences into a coherent plot. I'll also note the important characters and their roles in the narrative to ensure continuity. This approach should help in reordering the sentences accurately.\n",

    "ground_truth":"In 1973 in the jungles of Peru, a research team led by Ezekiel Sims and his pregnant colleague Constance Webb discovers an unidentified species of spider with rare healing properties. Ezekiel betrays the team and claims the spider for himself, shooting Constance in a struggle over the spider before leaving her for dead. An indigenous tribe attempts to save Constance by having the spider bite her, but she dies shortly after giving birth to Cassandra. Thirty years later, Cassandra, going by 'Cassie', works as a paramedic in New York City alongside her co-workers Ben Parker and O'Neil. During a dangerous call, Cassie falls into the water and has a near-death experience. Ben revives her, but she begins to experience visions. Initially, she dismisses them as déjà vu, but after failing to prevent O'Neil's death, Cassie realizes that she can see into the future. Ezekiel, who has limited precognition power and enhanced physical abilities, collects information on three teenage girls: Julia Cornwall, Anya Corazon, and Mattie Franklin. His visions lead him to believe that they are destined to kill him. Cassie is also drawn to the same girls and intervenes to stop Ezekiel from ambushing them at Grand Central Terminal. She steals a taxi and takes Julia, Anya, and Mattie out of the city to hide them in a nearby forest. Cassie returns to her apartment and finds Constance's notes, which reveal Ezekiel's identity and the true nature of his powers. Ignoring Cassie's instructions, the girls go to a diner where Ezekiel finds them. After briefly incapacitating Ezekiel by ramming him with the car, Cassie takes the girls back to Queens and they take refuge in Ben's house. Cassie flies to Peru and tracks down the tribal chief who saved her mother. The chief puts Cassie through a ritual that separates her soul from her body. She experiences a plane of higher consciousness where all living things are connected and where every possible future can be seen. She learns that Constance sought the spider not for fame or money, as she had originally thought, but to save her from having the same fatal hereditary disease that Constance suffered from. Ben's pregnant sister-in-law Mary goes into labor earlier than expected and he takes her to the hospital, along with the girls, who are seen on camera when in the car. Ezekiel intercepts them again, but Cassie rescues the girls in an ambulance and distracts Ezekiel so Ben and Mary can escape.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to reorder these plot summary sentences for a movie. Let's see... The user provided a bunch of sentences that are out of order, and I need to figure out the correct sequence.\n\nFirst, I'll read through all the sentences carefully to understand the flow of the story. It seems to be a superhero or action movie with a group of girls, Cassie, Ben, and Ezekiel involved. There are a lot of action scenes, some character development, and a main antagonist in Ezekiel.\n\nLooking at the sentences, the first part mentions Cassie returning to her apartment and finding Constance's notes. So maybe that's the starting point, setting up the plot. So sentence 1: Cassie finds Constance's notes.\n\nThen, she uses her powers to guide the girls to safety, and her clairvoyance lets her see the future. That probably comes after she discovers the notes, as she gains more powers. So sentences 2 and 3 fit there.\n\nNext, Ben's sister-in-law Mary goes into labor, and he takes her to the hospital with the girls, seen on camera in the car. This should happen after they're in Queens, taking refuge at Ben's house. So maybe that's later in the story.\n\nThen, there's a scene where Cassie works as a paramedic with Ben and O'Neil. But she starts having visions. So this is her current job, before her visions kick in. So this comes later, after she's using her powers but starts seeing the future.\n\nThe group lures Ezekiel to a firework factory with traps. So that's a significant action point, so perhaps later in the story after they know about him and his powers.\n\nCassie then wakes up blind and paraplegic. That must be a turning point. Before this, she was saving the girls and using her powers.\n\nIgnoring her advice, the girls go to a diner where Ezekiel finds them. So that's a consequence of Cassie's injury. So this comes after she's injured.\n\nMary gives birth to her son while Cassie is in the hospital. That's a key event, probably near the beginning of the story, as it's in 1973 with the research team, Ezekiel, and Constance.\n\nIn 1973, the research team discovers the spider with healing properties. An indigenous tribe saves Constance with a spider bite, but she dies after giving birth to Cassie. So this is the origin story.\n\nAfter Ezekiel betrays them, he shoots Constance. Then Cassie has a near-death experience in the water, seeing the connection between all living things. The chief puts her through a ritual where she learns about Constance's disease and that she sought the spider to save herself and Cassie.\n\nThen Cassie wakes up, now blind and paraplegic. She then assures the girls she'll mentor them. She steals a taxi to hide them in a forest.\n\nShe then intervenes to stop Ezekiel at Grand Central Terminal. He intercepts them again, but Cassie rescues the girls in an ambulance, allowing Ben and Mary to escape.\n\nEzekiel then ignites a firework that hits Cassie, leading her to become blind. He collects info on the girls and betrays the team, claiming the spider for himself, shooting Constance.\n\nFinally, Cassie sets a trap that crushes Ezekiel, killing him. His visions lead him to believe they'll kill him, but he's defeated.\n\nPutting all these in order, the correct sequence starts with Cassie finding the notes, then learning about Ezekiel. Her powers develop, she helps the girls, faces Ezekiel, gets injured, tries to save the girls, and finally confronts Ezekiel.\n\nAlso, the movie spans from 1973 to 30 years later, showing how Cassie becomes a paramedic and uses her powers to save people before facing Ezekiel again.\n\nSo the timeline is: 1973 events with Constance and the spider, Eylül.scope where Constance dies and Cassie gains visions, then Cassie's current life as a paramedic, and the events where she confronts Ezekiel again, leading to her becoming blind and paraplegic.\n\nI need to arrange the sentences in this order: starting with Cassie finding the notes, her powers, setting up the trio, then the past origin with the spider, her near-death experience, her current role with Ben, the confrontation with Ezekiel, her injury, and the final confrontation where Ezekiel is defeated.\n\nLet me list all the sentences grouped in order:\n\n1.

    "filtered_answer":"\n\n<PLOT_SUMMARY>\n\nIn 1973, in the jungles of Peru, a research team led by Ezekiel Sims and his pregnant colleague Constance Webb discovers an unidentified species of spider with rare healing properties. An indigenous tribe attempts to save Constance by having the spider bite her, but she dies shortly after giving birth to Cassandra. Ezekiel betrays the team and claims the spider for himself, shooting Constance in a struggle over the spider before leaving her for dead.\n\nThirty years later, Cassandra, going by 'Cassie', works as a paramedic in New York City alongside her co-workers Ben Parker and O'Neil. Although she initially dismisses her clairvoyant visions as déjà vu, she realizes their significance after failing to prevent the death of her co-worker, O'Neil. Cassie's vision of the future grows stronger, and she begins to use her powers to guide and protect the girls she rescued—Julia Cornwall, Anya Corazon, and Mattie Franklin. \n\nCassie returns to her apartment and finds Constance's notes, which reveal Ezekiel's identity and the true nature of his powers. She uses her powers to guide the girls to safety. However, her clairvoyance enables her to see fully into the future.\n\nCassie flies to Peru and tracks down the tribal chief who saved her mother. She learns that Constance sought the spider not for fame or money, as she originally thought, but to save herself from having the same fatal hereditary disease that Constance suffered from. The chief puts Cassie through a ritual that separates her soul from her body, allowing her to experience a plane of higher consciousness where all living things are connected and where every possible future can be seen.\n\nCassie wakes up to discover that she is now blind and paraplegic due to her injuries. Ignoring Cassie's instructions, the girls go to a diner where Ezekiel finds them. Cassie is taken to the hospital just as Mary gives birth to her son.\n\nDuring a dangerous call, Cassie falls into the water and has a near-death experience. She sets off the final trap, which fatally crushes Ezekiel. Her visions lead him to believe that they are destined to kill him.\n\nThe group lures Ezekiel to a condemned firework factory and sets up traps to disorient him while Cassie calls for a medical evacuation helicopter to fly to their location. Cassie steals a taxi and takes Julia, Anya, and Mattie out of the city to hide them in a nearby forest. Cassie assures the girls that she will mentor them in their future roles when the time comes.\n\nShe is also drawn to the same girls and intervenes to stop Ezekiel from ambushing them at Grand Central Terminal. Ezekiel intercepts them again, but Cassie rescues the girls in an ambulance and distracts Ezekiel so Ben and Mary can escape.\n\nAn ignited firework strikes Cassie in the face, blinding her. Ezekiel, who has limited precognition power and enhanced physical abilities, collects information on the three teenage girls: Julia Cornwall, Anya Corazon, and Mattie Franklin. Ezekiel betrays the team and claims the spider for himself, shooting Constance in a struggle over the spider before leaving her for dead.\n\n<\/PLOT_SUMMARY>",

He eventually photographs Prince Andrew walking with Jeffrey Epstein in Central Park after photographing a young girl leaving from the same building just prior. Nine years later, directly after major staffing cuts are announced, young BBC Newsnight guest producer Sam McAlister comes across the photo placed next to a Prince Andrew sponsored, young entrepreneurs event article. So, she tries to contact the photographer. Prince Andrew's private secretary Amanda Thirsk believes the Epstein photo is a key reason the palace's event was not attended by the press.

Having spoken to Sam recently, Amanda agrees to meet and negotiate terms for an interview. Called out by a co-worker for being vocally critical of lead presenter Emily Maitlis and for having sensationalist leanings, the programme editor, Esme, has a word with Sam. Including Emily in the dialogue, she tells her she welcomes her innovations, but reminds her they must find a way to work together regardless of the tension. Jae gets back to Sam, sharing photos of young girls going in and out of Epstein's Manhattan home. He insists that Epstein has been doing it for many years. Arriving home, Sam finds her mother, who has been looking after her teenage son Lucas.

Both Amanda are criticised for meeting Sam for drinks by Jason and Sam by another journalist. Upset by the altercation, Sam vents to her mother.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so I have this task where I need to reorder sentences from a plot summary of a movie. The user gave me a mess of sentences from the original plot summary, and I need to sort them out in the correct order. The plot summary should start with <PLOT_SUMMARY>, so I have to make sure to place it correctly at the beginning.\n\nFirst, I'll read through all the provided sentences to get a sense of the story. It seems to involve characters like Amanda, Sam, Emily, Prince Andrew, and others. There are mentions of negotiations, a CV, events at Buckingham Palace, legal settlements, and news about the Royal Family.\n\nI should start with the beginning of the story. That usually sets the scene. Looking at the sentences, the first one talks about Amanda inviting Sam to Buckingham Palace. That seems like a good opening because it introduces a key location and sets up the main conflict or meeting point.\n\nNext, I need to determine the order in which the events unfolded. The sentences mention things happening in 2022, 2010, and 2019, so I should arrange them chronologically. However, some sentences might not be chronological but part of a sub-plot. For example, there are mentions of Jason, Epstein, and Sam's mother, Jae.\n\nI should look for time markers like \"in early 2022,\" \"in 2019,\" and \"in 2010.\" Starting with the 2010 part might help set the stage for later events. But since the first sentence is about 2022, maybe it's better to start there and then go into earlier events.\n\nI also see that there are mentions of a settlement in 2022, an interview in 2019, and the photo from 2010. These events are related but might not be in order. I need to associate them correctly.\n\nThere's a part where Sam and Amanda meet, then there’s an altercation and negotiations for an interview. Then, the Duke steps down. So, the story might move from setting the scene in 2022, to past events, then to Sam's actions, leading up to the Duke's decision.\n\nI should also check for keywords that indicate a change in setting or plot. For example, \"She tries to bond with him over a crush\" suggests a development in a character's relationship, which could be an important point in the story.\n\nI need to be careful with the order of interactions. After their meeting, there’s an altercation, then they negotiate. Then, there’s an event where Jae photographs them, leading to the settlement. Then Sam leaves the BBC and starts teaching. After that, the interview happens, and the Duke steps down.\n\nI think starting with Amanda inviting Sam makes sense. Then, the settlement and the past events are explained. Then, Sam's actions with her mother and the news team's decisions, leading to the Duke's downfall.\n\nI should piece these together, ensuring that each sentence flows logically to the next. It's a bit like puzzle solving, figuring out which sentence comes after another based on context and time.\n\nI also notice that some sentences introduce characters or settings that are important. For example, the mention of the LSE and the photo in 2010 are key plot points. I should place these where they make sense in the sequence.\n\nLet me go through each sentence and see where they fit best. The first two sentences are about the invitation and the meeting. That should be the start. Then, the sentence about the settlement in 2022 might come next because it's a key event related to Andrew.\n\nThen, the part about Epstein needing to settle and the prince's denial should follow because it's tied to the settlement. After that, Sam and Emily's bonding, their workload, and the criticism from Jason and the journalist.\n\nThen, the interaction with Esme and theatican(?? Wait, maybe I read that wrong. It says \"television\"d interview, but the user wrote \"television\".) So, Sam is called out by Esme, then Amanda meets and negotiates.\n\nAfter that, the morning call from Amanda, arriving home to see her mother, who gives her a pep talk. That's an important character moment, so that should come after the initial meeting and before the Media decisions.\n\nThen, Jason's suggestion about friendly reporters, and Amanda's agreement but hesitation because of her past. Then, the media makes the scoop, and Sam is left out, leading up to the Duke stepping down.\n\nI think the key to rebuilding the plot is to arrange the sentences so that each logically follows the previous one, maintaining a chronological flow and building up tension.\n\nI might have missed some details, but I'll do my best. Let me try to list the sentences in order based on understanding:\n\n1. Amanda invites Sam to Buckingham Palace.\n2. They meet with Amanda, the Prince, and Beatrice.\n3. Prince Andrew settles the lawsuit for £12 million, insists Epstein was involved.\n4. Sam works long hours, tries to bond with Andrew through a crush.\n5. Emily includes her in dialogue, talks about working together despite tension.\n6. They're criticized by Jason and another journalist.\n7. She tries to contact the photographer, then Epstein dies.\n8. Sam left the BBC in 2021 to teach at the LSE.\n9. Jason is consulted, Prince Andrew insists he ended the friendship after scandals.\n10. The 2019 interview is shown, Andrew denies the allegations.\n11. After tea, Sam convinces her to leave the grounds for a drink.\n12. Amanda is called out by Esme for being critical and sensational.\n13. Amanda meets with Sam after a conversation, agrees to negotiate.\n14. Amanda calls Sam in the morning with the interview time.\n15. Sam arrives home, meets her mother who gives her a pep talk.\n16. Jason suggests friendly reporters to improve Andrew's image; Amanda is hesitant.\n17. Newsnight gets the scoop; Sam is seemingly left out.\n18. Amanda asks about Emily and Sam's knowledge of her.\n19. Sam is upset, vents to her mother.\n20. Jae shares photos of Epstein with young girls.\n21. Sam rushes to Amanda's to convince Andrew to do the interview.\n22. The Duke steps down.\n23. In 2010, Jae photographs Andrew and Epstein with a girl.\n24. After staffing cuts, Sam sees the photo at Andrew's event; decides to investigate.\n25. The photo is used, leading to the Duke's downfall.\n\nWait, that can't be right. For example, the 2010 scene should come before 2022 because it's a past event. So I think I arranged it wrong. The original events from 2010, leading up to the photo, then 2019's interview, then 2022's settlement.\n\nSo I need to reorder all of this. Let's try again.\n\nStarting from 2010, then 2019, then 2022, then 2022 onwards.\n\nSo:\n\n2010: Jae takes a photo of Andrew and Epstein with a young girl.\n\n2019: Newsnight interview about Andrew and Epstein’s relationship and allegations.\n\n2022: Andrew settles the lawsuit, Sam and Amanda meet, then later settles things for an interview, leading to Andrew stepping down.\n\nIn between, the story of Sam, her mother, and the Newsnight team.\n\nSo, the sentences should start with the 2010 event, then 2019, then 2022.\n\nSo, reconstructing:\n\n1. In 2010, Jae photographs Andrew with Epstein and a girl.\n2. In 2019, Newsnight airs the interview.\n3. In 2022, Andrew settles the lawsuit, the photo is known, Sam and Amanda meet, then the team works on the interview, leads to the Duke stepping down.\n\nThus, the timeline would be: 2010 photo → 2019 interview → 2022 events.\n\nSo in terms of plot, we can start from 2010, then move to 2019, then 2022, leading up to the current events.\n\nBut since the original sentences have the 2022 events first, maybe the plot starts with the invitation in 2022, then explains the past events.\n\nAlternatively, the plot might interweave past and present. So after the invitation, Sam and Andrew talk, then in the past, there's the photo from 2010, then in 2019, the interview.\n\nHmm, it's a bit tricky, but I think the logical flow would be:\n\n- Start in 2022: Amanda invites Sam, they meet, Prince Andrew's legal issues.\n\n- Then mention the past: how Robbyn neatly, or rather, the 2019 interview and the 2010 photo.\n\nWait, no, the sentences are not in order. It's just a bunch of sentences, so I need to figure out what's the flow.\n\nAnother approach: The plot likely goes from the current situation (2022) to the past events, to how it affects Sam and the interview, leading to the Duke stepping down.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Amanda, in 2022, invites Sam for a negotiation meeting at Buckingham Palace.\n\n- They discuss Andrew's PR issues due to Epstein situation.\n\n- Sam brings up the photo from 2010, the interview in 2019, and the settlement in 2022.\n\n- Then, there's the event where Sam and Amanda meet, she gets a call, etc.\n\nThis way, it's a mix of past and present.\n\nI need to make sure that the entire timeline is presented correctly, but some sentences, like the one about Jason's suggestion, should come after they've decided to go ahead with the interview.\n\nAfter the initial meeting, Jason suggests to reach out to friendly reporters, and Amanda is hesitant but agrees. Then, Newsnight secures the scoop, but leaves Sam out. Then, Sam and her mother talk, then Jae gives her info. Then Sam rushes to Amanda's house to convince Andrew for the interview, leading to the Duke stepping down.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Start with the invitation in 2022.\n\n- Then mention the 2010 photo.\n\n- Then the 2019 interview.\n\n- Then the 2022 settlement.\n\n- Then the meeting between Sam and Amanda.\n\n- Then Sam and her mother.\n\n- Then Jason's suggestion.\n\n- Then the execution of the interview and the Duke's decision.\n\nThis will create a timeline that explains the background before moving to the present situation.\n\nI think this makes the most sense. So, I'll start the plot summary with the invitation, then move into the past, and then current events leading up to the royal crisis.\n\nI should also make sure that each sentence logically follows the previous one, maintaining continuity and flow.\n",

    "ground_truth":"Alin (Esra Bilgic) and Ozan (Ushan Cakir) are Interpol officers who have been assigned to investigate a series of art thefts around the world. The thief seems to be breaking into museums and stealing the least valuable works of art, ignoring the other priceless artifacts in the same location. They quickly realize that the art thief is not grabbing the least valued paintings at the museums but specifically all paintings related to love. Putting this together helps them figure out the next target for the thief. Alin is right, but the thief is able to grab the painting in broad daylight with no one knowing and leave Alin just enough of a trace, see his face, but not be able to catch him. Alin immediately knows who the thief is now. Her ex-lover, Guney (Birkan Sokullu). Guney and Alin were going steady when he suddenly disappeared, without explanation, and left her heart broken. Interpol chief refuses to arrest Guney, as he is a billionaire and can easily buy the paintings he wants. He also says that Alin has a history with Guney, and hence they need solid evidence against him. Alin decides she's going to use her charm to catch Guney red-handed. When Alin approaches Guney, he asks her for a second chance, and she pretends to reluctantly give in. Guney explains that he ran away the first time as he was scared of commitment. In the meantime, Ozan has the information to figure out who is working with Guney now, and they also find a warehouse where they work. Alin tries to go there and get some evidence, but she's caught by Vera, Guney's hacker. Vera and Alin get into a physical fight, leading Vera to believe Alin is a cop. But she only manages to see her eyes as Alin was wise enough to cover her face. From the recovered material, Alin figures out that the next theft will be in Prague. Alin and Guney spend more time together, and he tells her that he doesn't want to spend time apart, but he has a business trip to Prague for two days. Alin convinces him to take her along. This is when she gets the billionaire treatment, and he takes her on a private jet and gifts her fancy new clothes. On the flight, Vera finds something strange about Alin and tells the other guy on their team, Omer (Hakan Ummak), that she might have been the cop who tried to break into the warehouse. At the time, Guney had dismissed the idea and said it must have been a random break-in. Alin's partner shows up at the hotel, saying she can't be doing a mission that her chief denied, but she's determined to catch Guney. However, Ozan thinks it's just her attraction to him that's keeping her there. Guney takes Alin to a private dress rehearsal for a romantic musical she's been wanting to watch, and it is enough for her to fall for Guney again. Alin and Guney almost go all the way in his hotel room, but Alin claims they're going too fast and leaves. The next day is the day of the robbery, and Guney leaves Alin with a car to use all day while he has some work. The second he's gone, Ozan and she follow him. Yet again, they're unable to catch him, and they're back to Istanbul and square one. Faysal Varli is an old man and a sleaze who is a businessman, and Guney plans on buying his company. Faysal has a private painting collection. He gives Alin and Guney a private viewing of this collection, and immediately, Alin realizes they're all stolen. This gives Guney the idea to break into the highly protected collection. This is a foolproof security system with too many layers, yet Guney has the confidence to break into it. There's a voice and face recognition step, and there are about 75 cameras leading up to the collection, so it's almost an impossible task. Additionally, there's a set of words, like a pass key, that keeps changing, that Faysal himself has to repeat for the vault to open. It's his voice that's recognized, but Guney has a solution for it all. Just as Guney is trying to break in and everything is going to plan, Faysal decides to bring a woman down to the vault. Vera freaks out, but just when they're about to enter the room, Faysal is asked to go back to the house. Alin is there to tell Faysal that his collection is going to be stolen from him, but he doesn't believe her. She tells him that she doesn't know who it will be, but she knows there's a plan. This is obviously not the answer he wants, so he chokes her to try and get her to spill, but Ozan shows up at that moment. He asks for the crime scene, but Faysal tells him to leave if he doesn't have a warrant. Alin decides the best thing to do is leave and take Ozan and the team with her. The next day, Faysal shows up in her bedroom, and finds out it was Guney who stole the painting thanks to her notes in her apartment with all the investigation on Guney. Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and tell him the truth. Guney already knew that Alin worked for Interpol, and he left a trail for her to find him on purpose. Guney had disappeared for some time without a trace because he was caught in Mexico. This left Alin heartbroken because he never reached out to her or told her anything about what he used to do. After 3 years, he did a press conference to show up on the grid again, but by this time, Alin had already started to work for Interpol in Paris. Apparently, he found it really hard to find her, and when he did, he couldn't just tell her he was a thief. So now, he basically made her go in circles to fall in love with him again. Guney takes Alin to his grandfather's house. It seems he got interested in art thanks to his grandfather, who was a wonderful painter but was never recognized for his work. However, the reason Guney decided to start stealing is because when they were first together, Alin told him that the Mona Lisa went up in value only after it got stolen. Faysal stands across from Guney and Alin in front of a lake, a dead end. Faysal shoots past Guney's ear, just missing him to threaten him. This is after Guney has been tormenting Alin to tell him she still loves him all the way while running away from Faysal. Just as Faysal is about to shoot again, Ozan shows up. Guney did Ozan a favor by giving him information about Faysal (when Guney broke into Faysal's vault, he found information and documents that linked Faysal to the drugs trade); in return, Ozan will leave Guney alone because he's only a harmless art and heart stealing person. Since Ozan is an ex-narcotics officer, he is, of course, thrilled to lock up Faysal. Alin promises not to turn Guney in and tells him she loves him. There are two options, one is that Alin stops working for Interpol so that she and Guney can go on a robbing spree since they won't really have anything else to do and they're both clearly so interested in art. On the other hand, Guney will stop stealing for the thrill of it and go back to being just a boring old billionaire. Or maybe they start an underground art gallery together with all the stolen pieces and never get found out.",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I have to try to reorder this plot summary of a movie. The user has given me a bunch of sentences that are randomly ordered and wants me to start with <PLOT_SUMMARY> and then put the correct order of these sentences together. \n\nFirst, I need to read through all the sentences carefully and try to figure out the correct sequence. Let me see... The sentences talk about characters like Alin, Guney, Ozan, Faysal, Vera, and Omer. There's a lot about art theft, Interpol, and some mentions of a press conference, a broken heart, a robbery, and a dress rehearsal.\n\nMaybe I can start by identifying the key events in order. It seems like Alin starts working for Interpol after Guney disappears. Then, there's a press conference where Faysal shows up, but Alin is already with Interpol. Then comes the theft in Prague, where the next target is revealed. I remember something about Faysal having a private collection and that Guney plans to break into a highly protected collection.\n\nAfter that, there's a part where Alin and Guney spend time together, she tries to warn him, and they almost go too far. Then, they find a warehouse and a possible suspect. Ozan gets info from Guney about Faysal's drugs trade, so he lets Guney go. \n\nThere's a part where Vera finds something strange about Alin, maybe implying she's a cop. Then, Alin decides to leave with Ozan and the team, either going back to Istanbul or starting an art gallery. \n\nGuney and Alin have a history; he disappeared, left her heartbroken, then took her on a private jet and gifted her things. She felt heartbroken because he didn't reach out. Then, Guney starts stealing to gain money, influenced by his grandfather who was a painter but never recognized. \n\nLater, Alin wants to warn Guney but he asks for a second chance, she pretends to give in. There's a voice and face recognition at a security system with 75 cameras, Guney breaks in. He takes Alin to a romantic musical dress rehearsal, which makes her fall for him again. \n\nThey almost have sex in his hotel room but she leaves. She convinces him to take her to a private viewing of the collection, and she realizes the pieces are stolen. She tells Faysal, but he doesn't believe her. The Interpol chief won't arrest Guney because he's a billionare. \n\nAlin and Ozan are Interpol officers assigned to investigate.Guney's voice is recognized but he has a solution. Faysal stands across from them, a dead end. Next day, Faysal appears in Alin's room, finds out it was Guney stealing via her notes. Guney did Ozan a favor by giving info about Faysal, so Ozan will leave Guney alone because he's harmless. \n\nHe mentions Alin's history with Guney and they need solid evidence. Alin is right, but the thief grabs the painting in broad daylight, leaving a trace but not being caught. Faysal threatens to call the cops if Alin asks for the crime scene without a warrant.\n\nGuney ran away before because he was scared of commitment. Alin's partner shows up, but she decides to do the mission despite being denied. Vera freaks out but they manage to follow Faysal.\n\nThere are two options: Alin stops working for Interpol to rob with Guney, or she catches him. Vera and Alin fight, Vera thinks Alin is a cop. Alin uses charm to catch Guney. Guney might stop stealing and go back to being a billionaire.\n\nDuring a heist, everything goes well until Faysal shows up with a woman, but Guney takes the painting. Then, Guney takes Alin to his grandfather's house, revealing he's an art lover and this is his cause. Alin goes there to get evidence but is caught by Vera, Guney's hacker.\n\nI think the beginning starts with Guney disappearing, leaving Alin heartbroken. Then she gets the billionaire treatment, then moves on to work for Interpol. She tries to warn Guney, they have a history, then she becomes involved in the case. There's the press conference where Faysal shows up, then the next theft in Prague. \n\nAfter the theft, they find the warehouse, get info, then go to Faysal's vault, find the pass key, follow Faysal, and have the conflict where Alin and Vera fight. Then, the possible endings: Guney either stops stealing or continues, and Alin either leaves Interpol or catches him.\n",

    "ground_truth":"Kora and the surviving warriors return to Veldt, believing that Kora had killed Admiral Noble in hand-to-hand combat and prevented the forthcoming assault on the planet to claim its food supplies, but Aris, a Motherworld soldier working as a double agent for the village people, informs them that the dreadnought ship will arrive in five days. The fighters join the small group of villagers to harvest the entire grain supply in three days, so the flour can be used as leverage to prevent the Motherworld forces from simply bombing the village from orbit; over the remaining two days, Titus intends to train the villagers to fight.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I've been given this plot summary of a movie, but the sentences are all jumbled up. My task is to reorder them correctly so that the plot makes sense. I need to start the summary with \"<PLOT_SUMMARY>\" and make sure all the sentences are in the right order.\n\nFirst, I should probably read through all the sentences to understand the main events. Let me list them out as they are:\n\n1. In the aftermath, the village mourns the dead, and Kora admits her past, which Titus reveals he already knew.\n2. Kora and Gunnar become lovers, and she admits that Regent Balisarius compelled her involvement in the assassination of the Motherworld's king, queen, and young Princess Issa, with Kora herself shooting the princess.\n3. He also reveals that Issa is secretly alive and in hiding, and the assembled group declare their intentions to find her and restore the royal lineage to the throne in order to depose Balisarius.\n4. The group also reveal their pasts to each other, but Kora declines to share her involvement in Issa's death.\n5. Kora attempts to surrender to him once Noble promises to spare the village, but Gunnar triggers the ambush anyway.\n6. Balisarius had then attempted to frame her for the coup, but she had instead fled to Veldt in a Motherworld shuttle to hide from the law.\n7. Titus and Tarak lead the villages in successfully repelling the first wave, though Nemesis is killed defending the women and children.\n8. The large contingent of heavily armored and mechanized second wave of Motherworld troops pushes the few remaining defenders back, destroying much of the village, but Kora and Gunnar use the shuttle and stolen uniforms to infiltrate the dreadnought, laying explosives on the engine.\n9. The fighters join the small group of villagers to harvest the entire grain supply in three days, so the flour can be used as leverage to prevent the Motherworld forces from simply bombing the village from orbit; over the remaining two days, Titus intends to train the villagers to fight.\n10. Over two days, Titus, Nemesis, Tarak, Milius, and Kora train the handful of villagers in combat, preparing a plan involving digging trenches and tunnels in the fields, laying explosives, and preparing Kora's shuttle.\n11. When Noble arrives with the dreadnought, his forces scan the village, identifying where the women and children are hiding, protected by Nemesis and Aris, and send forces to capture them to force Kora out.\n12. Kora and the surviving warriors return to Veldt, believing that Kora had killed Admiral Noble in hand-to-hand combat and prevented the forthcoming assault on the planet to claim its food supplies, but Aris, a Motherworld soldier working as a double agent for the village people, informs them that the dreadnought ship will arrive in five days.\n13. Jimmy arrives to help the village defenders push back the assault, and the explosives bring down the dreadnought.\n14. Devra Bloodaxe and her rebel forces arrive in ships to destroy the remaining Motherworld troops, leading to victory.\n15. In the process, Gunnar kills Noble but later dies from his injuries.\n\nAlright, so I need to arrange these sentences in the correct order. Let me try to figure out the sequence of the plot.\n\nStarting with the beginning of the story, probably the first part. Wait, the first sentence starts with \"In the aftermath...\", so that seems like the beginning after some events. Maybe the first thing that happens is Kora and Gunnar becoming lovers, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the start is introduces Kora and Titus knowing each other, then the past is revealed. Let me think.\n\nLooking at the sentences, maybe sentence 2 comes after they are together. Sentence 2 is about Kora admitting her past to Titus, so that must come after they've become lovers or after some development.\n\nThen sentence 1 seems to follow, where Kora and Gunnar become lovers. Wait, no, maybe sentence 1 is after the events. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps sentence 2 is Kora revealing her past to Titus, so that must come after they've established their relationship.\n\nI think the order is something like:\n\nStart with the village in the aftermath, mourning the dead, then Kora admits her past, which Titus knew.\n\nThen Kora and Gunnar become lovers.\n\nThen Titus reveals more about the situation, that Issa is alive, and the group decides to find her.\n\nThen the group reveals their pasts, but Kora doesn't share hers.\n\nThen Kora tries to surrender but Gunnar ambushes, leading to the next part.\n\nSo maybe the order is:\n\nSentence 1: aftermath, Kora admits, Titus knew.\n\nSentence 2: Kora and Gunnar become lovers, she admits about Balisarius and Issa.\n\nSentence 3: Titus reveals Issa is alive, group decides to find her.\n\nSentence 4: group reveals pasts, Kora declines.\n\nSentence 5: Kora tries to surrender, Gunnar triggers ambush.\n\nSentence 6: she fled to Veldt.\n\nThen Titus and Tarak repel first wave, Nemesis dies.\n\nThen second wave comes, Kora and Gunnar infiltrate, lay explosives.\n\nThen the fighters harvest grain, prepare over two days.\n\nThen over two days, training happens.\n\nNoble arrives, forces scan village, send to capture women and children.\n\nKora returns to Veldt, believing she killed Noble, but Aris says dreadnought is coming.\n\nJimmy arrives, explosives bring down dreadnought.\n\nDevra arrives, rebels destroy remaining troops, victory.\n\nGunnar kills Noble but dies.\n\nSo putting it together, the order would be:\n\n1. Aftermath: village mourns, Kora admits past, Titus knew.\n\n2. Kora and Gunnar become lovers; she tells about Regent, Issa alive.\n\n3. They decide to find Issa, depose Balisarius.\n\n4. Group reveals pasts, Kora declines.\n\n5. Kora attempts surrender, Gunnar ambush.\n\n6. She fled to Veldt.\n\n7. Titus and Tarak repel first wave, Nemesis dies.\n\n8. Second wave comes, Kora and Gunnar infiltrate dreadnought.\n\n9. Village prepares to harvest grain, Titus trains over two days.\n\n10. Over two days, training and planning.\n\n11. Noble arrives, scans village, sends to capture women and children.\n\n12. Kora returns to Veldt, believing she killed Noble, but Aris warns.\n\n13. Jimmy arrives, brings down dreadnought.\n\n14. Devra arrives, rebels defeat Motherworld.\n\n15. Gunnar kills Noble but dies.\n\nWait, maybe the steps after 6 are 7 (battle first wave), then 8 (second wave, infiltration), then 9 (harvesting), 10 (training), then Noble arrives (11), then 12 (Kora returns), 13-14 (attack and victory), and finally 15 (Gunnar dies).\n\nI think that's the correct order. Let me make sure all the points flow correctly.\n",

There's a rescue mission, a post-apocalyptic setting, and experiments with a serum.\n\nI notice the original plot summary starts in the middle of the story, so I need to piece together the beginning.

The villagers rescuing Su-na from Dr. Gi-su is a crucial event that should come early.\n\nThen, there's the aftermath where Nam-san and Ji-wan are dealing with the wasteland scenario. They scavenge for resources and face mutant soldiers. The experiment on teenagers and the death of So-yeon are important subplots that need to be placed correctly.\n\nDr. Gi-su's motivation is central—injecting a serum to make humans immortal, leading to teenager deaths. The accidental death of So-yeon adds emotional weight.\n\nI should also look for chronological markers, like when the wasteland happens, and how the characters respond. The conflict between the villagers and the scientist’s camp needs to be ordered logically.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll start with the introduction of the characters and the setting, then move to the discovery of experiments, the rescue, the subsequent scavenging, the fight with mutants, and finally the revelation about So-yeon’s death and Gi-su’s motivations.\n\nEnsuring each sentence flows into the next is important without omitting crucial details.

    "ground_truth":"Cyrus (Kevin Hart), a renowned international thief, leads a heist crew that consists of Denton (Vincent D'Onofrio), pilot Camila (Ursula Corbero), hacker Mi-Sun (Kim Yoon-Ji), safe-cracker Magnus (Billy Magnussen), and engineer Luke (Viveik Kalra). They undertake two simultaneous thefts, stealing a Van Gogh painting in London while staging the fake kidnapping of renowned NFT artist N8 (Jacob Batalon) in Venice. N8 was in Venice to auction a single edition NFT. The NFT by N8 is made by a self portrait mask comprising of 482 cameras. This mask will create the NFT, with a live 30-second feed from the auction itself. Once complete, the NFT will have captured the moment of its sale, which will include the buyer. The team staged a kidnapping for N8 and Cyrus points out that famous paintings rapidly increase in value after being stolen and he says that his crew stole the Van Gogh painting and sold it in the black market for $20 million to buy N8 NFTs. After being 'kidnapped', N8's NFT ballooned in value to $89 million. N8 decides to celebrate with the team after being promised a cut of the money ($27 million). Interpol agent Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a former fling of Cyrus, uncovers evidence implicating Denton, in the theft and arrests him. Denton was seen at the auction and Abby correctly deduced that his limp was a fake. Abby charges Denton with fraud since he participated in the auction and made a bid of more than $10 million, and he didn't have the funds to cover it. So that makes him eligible for extradition to the US. Rather than proceed with charges against the crew, Abby's superior, Commander Huxley (Sam Worthington), leverages their legal predicament to force them to help capture billionaire Lars Jorgenson (Jean Reno), who intends to make more money by working with the hacking group Leviathan to stage a massive flooding in Europe, allowing him to make billions in profit through stock manipulation. Lars was responsible for making millions by shorting airlines stock, after the crash of a New Zealand plane that killed 189 people. Now Huxley has a mole in Lars's organization named Arthur Tigue. As Leviathan requires payment of $500 million in untraceable gold bullion, Jorgenson has arranged for a shipment of gold to be taken from his vault in London and flown to Leviathan's bank in Zurich via a commercial airliner. Huxley cannot intercept the gold as it is a legal transaction. Huxley wants Cyrus and his crew to intercept this gold payment to Leviathan. Cyrus knows that Lars is a dangerous man and not to be trifled with, but Abby lures him in with an offer of full immunity for him and his entire crew, As part of the deal, Cyrus insists Abby join the team to provide certain cover for Interpol.

The gold weighs ten tons and will be delivered to Heathrow airport under armored cover. It will be loaded onto a Sky Suisse A-380 passenger plane to Zurich. The crew determines they will only be able to steal the gold while the airliner is in mid-air. To do so, they procure a private jet from a rich private art collector named Molsen that Camila will fly directly underneath the airliner, allowing Mi-Sun to switch the radar signals to make it seem like the plane is still on course while the crew diverts it to a private airfield. Mi-Sun says that the chances of turning on the signal Jammer on the A-380 and the transponder on the private jet (to mimic the A-380's signal) are next to zero. Out of UK airspace, Brussels ATC will be tracking the flight, and Abby has a contact there who will help them. Harry agrees to help Cyrus against a payment of a million dollars. In exchange for loaning his private jet, Cyrus promises Molsen to persuade N8 to make a special NFT art for him. After Magnus cracks the safe and Jorgenson's henchmen are incapacitated, the crew will extract the gold from the A-380 once it lands in the Swiss Alps. Their timing is complicated when Jorgenson executes a mole Arthur Tigue (Jess Liaudin) in his organization and moves up the delivery date. Nevertheless, the crew is ready on time. The crew takes their position on the A-380 on the day the gold is being transferred, but Luke pulls out of the heist at the last minute. Cyrus and his team successfully divert the plane. Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the A-380, Abby assembles and turns on the signal Jammer on the A-380, while Camila turns on the transponder to mimic the A-380 signal. Harry then calls the A-380 pilots and diverts them to Cortina due to heavy weather in Zurich. Camila puts the transponder on a drone headed to Zurich and follows the A-380 to Cortina. Jorgenson's henchmen (including Cormac (Burn Gorman) & Donal (Paul Anderson)) attempt a hijack, resulting in the plane crash landing at Cortina, followed by Camila landing the Molsen jet at the airport. Magnus, Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured. Magnus escapes on the ground, while the remaining three are taken aboard the Molsen jet with the gold, headed for Jorgenson's estate in Tuscany. Desperate for the gold to not reach Jorgenson, Huxley orders the plane shot down by NATO. Harry (David Proud), the crew's contact at air traffic control, works with Camila (who was piloting the Molsen jet) to get a message to the NATO fighter pilots that there are hostages on board the A-380, forcing them to stand down.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so the user has provided a plot summary of a movie that's been jumbled. They want me to reorder the sentences correctly. Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the flow of the plot. It's an action-thriller involving a heist team, a gold shipment, and some high-stakes criminal activities. The main characters are Cyrus, Abby, Camila, and others. The key points to reassemble include the heist setup, the diversion of the plane, the gold switch, Abby's investigation, the interception by Interpol, the NFT aspects, and the final showdown.\n\nLooking at the jumbled sentences, I should identify which ones come first, which build up the story, and which are pivotal moments. The beginning should set the scene: the crew preparing for the heist, the switch of the gold shipment, Luke's role in guiding the parachute. Then, the aftermath of the heist with Cyrus revealing the truth to Abby, their relationship, and Interpol's involvement.\n\nNext, Huxley's deal with Leviathan, the need to intercept the gold payment, N8's celebrations and his requested NFT. Then, the setup of the private jet and how they plan to divert the A-380. Camila's role in piloting, Mi-Sun using signal jammers, Magnus and others on the ground, and the risks involved.\n\nAs the story progresses, there's a complication with a mole, Arthur Tigue, which affects their plans. The capture of Cyrus, Abby, and Camila, the hijacking attempts, plane crashes, and the use of NFT evidence to expose Jorgenson. The gold's delivery to Zurich and the subsequent chase by NATO jets, exploring their alliances and the high-stakes nature of the mission.\n\nFinally, the climax where Abby defects, helps the team, and cripples Jorgenson's empire. The resolution involves Jorgenson's arrest, Abby facing her superior, and Denton being charged for fraud. \n\nPutting it all together, I'll start from the initial heist, move through the planning, complications, and then the escalating conflicts leading up to the intense final scenes. Ensuring each sentence logically follows the next, building up the tension and character development.\n",

Twenty years later, the trio continued to use Ricky Stanicky as their excuse to forego life obligations and avoid getting in trouble. JT and his wife, Susan (Anja Savcic), are about to have a baby shower, and Dean and his girlfriend, Erin (Lex Scott Davis), have been setting it up. Dean gets a call from 'Ricky' (who is really Wes), claiming that his testicular cancer is back, and that he is alone in Albany, New York. Erin and Susan encourage Dean and JT to spend time with Ricky. In reality, JT and Dean received tickets to see Marc Rebillet in Atlantic City, New Jersey. On their flight, the trio turn off their phones, post something as 'Ricky', and write in their Bible of Ricky Stanicky, detailing all of what 'Ricky Stanicky' has done. While in Atlantic City, they meet Rock-Hard Rod (John Cena), an actor and impersonator who sings sex-based parodies of popular songs. Rod is a major mooch, and soon the friends tire of him and want to be rid of him. Dean feels bad about how Rod was treated and apologizes to him, and this is when Rod gives Dean his business card. Shortly after, Dean learns that Susan went into labor six weeks early, forcing them to hurry back. At the hospital, the trio learn that Susan already gave birth to a boy named Whitaker. JT's mother-in-law, Leona (Heather Mitchell), does not believe Ricky Stanicky is real. Wes almost tells everyone the truth, but Dean pivots by saying that Ricky lied in order to celebrate being 5 years cancer-free with his best friends. Leona tells the trio that Ricky is invited to Whitaker's Bris. It turns out that Wes has been using the Ricky gig to score some alone time for himself (at the pot milk farm) away from his partner Keith (Daniel Monks). Wes also told Keith that he dated Ricky (who he said was a bi), just in case he needed an out with Keith. While Wes believes that it is time for them to come clean, Dean decides to hire Rod to play Ricky Stanicky. The guys had a 'Bible' on Ricky which had notes on every lie they told to their families about stuff they did with Ricky and share the same with Rod to bring him up to speed. At the Bris, Rod impresses everyone with his personality and knowledge as 'Ricky', including Leona, Carly (Erin's cousin), and Ted Summerhayes (William H. Macy) (Dean and JT's boss). Ricky riles Ted when he calls him an old school banker who works to make rich people richer. But Ted is also impressed when Ricky displays his knowledge of Ted's upcoming merger with World River. Ricky gives his stamp of approval to the merger. When Rod gives the trio the impression that he personally knows Carly's ex, Gary Polisner, they decide to drug Polisner with a Ketamine pill, but the Rabbi eats the pill instead. During the circumcision, the Rabbi Greenberg (Jeff Ross) has a reaction to the Ketamine, leaving Whitaker half-circumcised. Ricky uses Summerhayes' cigar cutter to complete the circumcision, causing everyone to celebrate. The next day, Summerhayes reveals that in preparation for their merger with World River, a major company from San Francisco, he has hired Ricky Stanicky for $250,000 per year to advise on the World River deal. Dean and JT are angry as this is more than what they make. Erin also drops by, revealing that she scored a reporting gig for a local news channel's 'Hero of the Week' segment, and is pursuing a story on Ricky and his alleged humanitarian efforts. Dean & JT plan to get Ricky fired to get him out of their lives. Dean sets up Ricky to present his game changer idea to Ted for the World River merger. Summerhayes decides to start a charity organization per Ricky's suggestion and makes Ricky the head of the World River merger, replacing Dean. Ricky also tells Ted that he has an 'Air-Dicking' habit when he gives presentations. Ted realizes that nobody listens to a word he says as they are distracted by his mannerisms on stage. Ted promotes Ricky as he believes Ricky tells him the truth. Rod has no idea about the merger and begins to record Dean to ask for advice. In anger, Dean tells him that he is Rod, not Ricky. Rod reveals that he legally changed his name to Richard Barbara Stanicky and tells Dean that he is thankful for being given a new life. Rod says that he cannot go back to Atlantic City as he will be killed for some things he did (including being in debt to some mafia types), which he doesn't remember as he was drunk. Dean is depressed, as he is going to lose his job and relationship with Erin once Ricky is proven to be a fraud. The next day, there is a party between Summerhayes' company and World River, where they intend to watch the premiere of Ricky's 'Hero of the Week' segment. Erin meets with Dean and tells him that she knows Ricky Stanicky is Rock-Hard Rod. Erin is heartbroken and says that it is too late for his apologies now. At the party, Summerhayes introduces Dean, who confesses to all the guests that Ricky Stanicky is fake, apologizing and promptly leaving the party. The 'Hero of the Week' story begins playing, and Rod tells the reporter about how he met Dean, and how the Ricky Stanicky Bible made him realize that he needed to change his life. As Summerhayes is about to fire Dean, the World River executives approach Summerhayes and enthusiastically approve of his choice to hire Ricky, ready to agree to a merger. Summerhayes asks Dean his thoughts, and they agree to the merger. After learning the truth about Ricky, Susan tells JT he has to camp in the backyard for six months as punishment. Erin reveals to Dean that she decided to pursue the story about Rod becoming Ricky. Dean asks if she can forgive him. Erin states it will be difficult, but hearing Ricky's recording of Dean talking about his love and appreciation for Erin helps. At the party, Ricky tells the trio that Carly is now his fiance, and that they are all going to work on cleaning the environment on the weekend. During the credits, videos and pictures are shown with Ricky and others cleaning, Carly donating her hair to children, Wes becoming a published author, JT brushing his teeth outside near his Porta-potty while Susan and Whitaker watch, everyone posing at Dean and Erin's wedding, and a viral TikTok remix made with Summerhayes' comedic jerking motions at various conferences.",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to help the user by rewriting a plot summary of a movie. The user provided a bunch of sentences that are supposed to be in the plot summary but are randomly ordered. My task is to put them back in the correct order. \n\nFirst, I should read through all the provided sentences to get a general idea of the plot. It involves characters like Dean, Ricky, Ted, and some friends dealing with a prank, a business merger, and some comedic misadventures. There are also elements of deception, apology, and some forgiveness.\n\nI'll start by noting the key events in order. The beginning mentions Dean setting up Ricky for a presentation to Ted about a merger. So that's probably the starting point. Then there's a prank in 1999 where they light a bag of dog feces on fire. After that, there's a conflict when Dean accidentally tells someone he's Rod, not Ricky. \n\nNext, the trio goes to the hospital to learn about Susan's baby. Rod gives them a business card after Dean apologizes, so that's a turning point in their relationship. The fire spreads to a scarecrow, leading to more complications. Then Summerhayes approves the merger after a conversation with Dean. On their flight, they act as Ricky and update their Bible, which is something that might have long-term consequences.\n\nErin gets heartbroken and is upset about the timing of the apologies. Susan punishes JT by making him camp in the backyard. Dean and JT get angry about this. Later, Susan goes into labor early, which forces them to rush back, adding urgency. \n\nIn Atlantic City, they meet a character who is an impersonator named Rock-Hard Rod, which is John Cena. They encourage Dean and JT to spend time with Ricky. Rod reveals his name change and expresses gratitude. At a party, Ricky announces he's engaged to Carly, and they plan an environmental weekend. \n\nSummerhayes is about to fire Dean, but the executives approve the merger when Ricky impresses Ted. Ricky riles Ted by calling him a banker who only helps the rich. Dean writes 'Ricky Stanicky' on a costume, leading to a police investigation. Erin finds out about Ricky's true identity.\n\nThe trio tries to hide Ricky, but things get complicated because Rod can't return to Atlantic City due to debts and mafia issues. Erin is torn but ultimately supports Dean. They attend a party where their ruse is exposed. Ricky is hired by Summerhayes despite the ruse, and Wes uses the gig for alone time. Leona questions Ricky's existence, and there's a mishap with a circumcision using Summerhayes' cigar cutter.\n\nAs the story progresses, the friends tire of Rod and want to get rid of him. Ted is distracted by his stage mannerisms, JT's mother-in-law doesn't believe in Ricky, and there's tension in their relationships. Dean faces losing his job and Erin. \n\nRod records Dean for advice. The circumcision goes poorly when the Rabbi has a reaction to Ketamine, leaving Whitaker half-circumcised.Dean and Erin prepare for a “Hero of the Week” segment on Ricky, but things don't go as planned. In the end, the friends find a way to clear their names and move on, but the events have long-lasting effects.\n\nPutting all these events in order, I need to sequence them from the earliest to the latest, ensuring the plot's progression makes sense. I'll start with setting up the characters and their initial situation, move through the prank and conflict, then the hospital visit and business card moment. Then, the merger proposal and complications from the prank. Relationships start to strain as truths come out, leading to a climax with the party and the true identity being revealed. Finally, the aftermath and the consequences for the characters.\n\nI should also check for any dependencies between the sentences. For example, the prank happens before the hospital visit, and the business card comes after the apology. The fire spreading affects the trio's plans, leading to the merger approval. The Bible of Ricky Stanicky is a recurring element that influences their behavior throughout the story. The hospital visit with Susan's baby is crucial, as it brings Whitaker into the picture.\n\nI'll list the sentences in the order they should appear, grouping similar events together. Making sure the timeline is consistent and that each event flows into the next. Also, checking for any sentences that must come after others based on context. For example, learning about Susan's baby leads to Rod giving them his business card.\n\nI need to make sure the plot summary is coherent, showing the development of the characters and the main plot points without repetition. That way, the user gets a clear and accurate summary that reads smoothly.\n",

As Summerhayes is about to fire Dean, the World River executives approach Summerhayes and enthusiastically approve of his choice to hire Ricky, ready to agree to a merger.  \n\nRicky riles Ted when he calls him an old-school banker who works to make rich people richer. Ted promotes Ricky as he believes Ricky tells him the truth. Failing to put out the fire, Dean writes the name 'Ricky Stanicky' on one of their costume pieces, leading police to believe that Ricky Stanicky, an out-of-town kid, was responsible for the prank.  \n\nErin meets with Dean and tells him that she knows Ricky Stanicky is Rock-Hard Rod. Rod says that he cannot go back to Atlantic City as he will be killed for some things he did (including being in debt to some mafia types), which he doesn't remember as he was drunk. Erin states it will be difficult, but hearing Ricky's recording of Dean talking about his love and appreciation for Erin helps.  \n\nRicky gives his stamp of approval to the merger. Erin also drops by, revealing that she scored a reporting gig for a local news channel's 'Hero of the Week' segment, and is pursuing a story on Ricky and his alleged humanitarian efforts.  \n\nThe next day, there is a party between Summerhayes' company and World River, where they intend to watch the premiere of Ricky's 'Hero of the Week' segment. Dean gets a call from 'Ricky' (who is really Wes), claiming that his testicular cancer is back, and that he is alone in Albany, New York. The 'Hero of the Week' story begins playing, and Rod tells the reporter about how he met Dean, and how the Ricky Stanicky Bible made him realize that he needed to change his life.  \n\nAt the Bris, Rod impresses everyone with his personality and knowledge as 'Ricky,' including Leona, Carly (Erin's cousin), and Ted Summerhayes (William H. Macy). Twenty years later, the trio continued to use Ricky Stanicky as their excuse to forego life obligations and avoid getting in trouble.  \n\nDuring the credits, videos and pictures are shown with Ricky and others cleaning, Carly donating her hair to children, Wes becoming a published author, JT brushing his teeth outside near his Porta-potty while Susan and Whitaker watch, everyone posing at Dean and Erin's wedding, and a viral TikTok remix made with Summerhayes' comedic jerking motions at various conferences.  \n\nThe guys had a 'Bible' on Ricky which had notes on every lie they told to their families about stuff they did with Ricky and shared the same with Rod to bring him up to speed. Ricky also tells Ted that he has an 'Air-Dicking' habit when he gives presentations. In reality, JT and Dean received tickets to see Marc Rebillet in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Wes also told Keith that he dated Ricky (who he said was a bi), just in case he needed an out with Keith.  \n\nThe next day, Summerhayes reveals that in preparation for their merger with World River, a major company from San Francisco, he has hired Ricky Stanicky for $250,000 per year to advise on the World River deal. Wes almost tells everyone the truth, but Dean pivots by saying that Ricky lied in order to celebrate being 5 years cancer-free with his best friends. Dean & JT plan to get Ricky fired to get him out of their lives.  \n\nAt the party, Summerhayes introduces Dean, who confesses to all the guests that Ricky Stanicky is fake, apologizing and promptly leaving the party. It turns out that Wes has been using the Ricky gig to score some alone time for himself (at the pot milk farm) away from his partner Keith (Daniel Monks). Leona tells the trio that Ricky is invited to Whitaker's Bris. Ricky uses Summerhayes' cigar cutter to complete the circumcision, causing everyone to celebrate.  \n\nWhile Wes believes that it is time for them to come clean, Dean decides to hire Rod to play Ricky Stanicky. Dean is depressed, as he is going to lose his job and relationship with Erin once Ricky is proven to be a fraud. Rod is a major mooch, and soon the friends tire of him and want to be rid of him. Ted realizes that nobody listens to a word he says as they are distracted by his mannerisms on stage.  \n\nJT's mother-in-law, Leona (Heather Mitchell), does not believe Ricky Stanicky is real. Dean asks if she can forgive him. JT and his wife, Susan (Anja Savcic), are about to have a baby shower, and Dean and his girlfriend, Erin (Lex Scott Davis), have been setting it up. Summerhayes decides to start a charity organization per Ricky's suggestion and makes Ricky the head of the World River merger, replacing Dean.  \n\nRod has no idea about the merger and begins to record Dean to ask for advice. During the circumcision, the Rabbi Greenberg (Jeff Ross) has a reaction to the Ketamine, leaving Whitaker half-circumcised.",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to reorder these plot summary sentences into the correct order. The user has provided a list of sentences that are out of sequence, and the task is to rewrite the plot summary starting with <PLOT_SUMMARY>, with the sentences correctly ordered. \n\nFirst, I should read through all the sentences carefully and try to identify the chronological order. Let me list out all the sentences and note which ones might come first, then build a sequence from there.\n\nStarting with the first sentence: \"While they both live alone, the two are friendly with one another -- Clay sees Eloise as the only person who ever took care of him.\" This seems like an introduction of the characters, so it might be the opening line. \n\nNext, \"He rents some space in a barn owned by retired teacher Eloise Parker, a widow who owns and lives in the house on the property.\" This follows the first sentence, so that's probably the second sentence.\n\nThen, \"Derek assigns the company's head of security, former CIA director Wallace Westwyld, to find a way to stop Adam.\" Derek is mentioned here, and it's about the company's head of security assigning someone. So Derek must have some significance later on, so this might come a bit later in the plot.\n\nMoving on, \"Verona learns that Eloise was scammed out of every penny she had.\" This seems to be a plot development about Eloise's situation, so it's probably after she's introduced.\n\n\"Devastated by the realization that she got scammed out of so much, Eloise shoots herself in the head.\" This is a significant emotional point, so it should come after Verona learns about the scam.\n\n\"Upon learning the hard way that Adam is after them, Garnett explains the situation to the crew's ringleader, 28-year-old tech executive Derek Danforth, who runs a Boston-based corporation called Danforth Enterprises.\" Here, Garnett is explaining to Derek, so Garnett must have known about the situation before this.\n\n\"Adam Clay is a beekeeper who has several hives of bees.\" This introduces Adam's backstory, so it should come after the initial setup.\n\n\"But Wallace learns that Adam is a retired member of a classified program called the Beekeepers, whose members are tasked with fighting different forms of corruption, operating above and beyond governmental jurisdiction.\" This gives background on Adam and the Beekeepers, so after Adam is introduced as a beekeeper.\n\n\"The call center's manager, Mickey Garnett, cons Eloise out of everything -- including more than $2,000,000 that's in the account of Safe Homes Foundation, a children's charity whose account she manages.\" This details the scam, so after Garnett explains to Derek.\n\n\"Verona apologizes to Adam for her accusation, and she tells him that the FBI cyber-crimes office has told her that the scammer crew that victimized Eloise has been operating for two years, but the FBI hasn't been able to identify any of the scammers.\" This is Verona taking action, so after Adam is arrested and after the FBI's statements.\n\n\"Adam finds Eloise's body in her house, and he's immediately arrested by Eloise's daughter, Boston-based FBI Special Agent Verona Parker, who hastily accuses Adam of shooting Eloise.\" This is a crucial plot point where Adam is arrested, so it should come after the FBI's notification and her accusation.\n\n\"She calls the number on the screen, and connects to a call center that's located in Springfield, Massachusetts, not aware that it's a phishing scam.\" This explains the phishing scam, so after she accuses Adam.\n\n\"Verona vows to find the scammers, but Adam, enraged by what happened, decides to hunt down the scammers himself, and make them pay for what they did to Eloise.\" This shows Adam's reaction and his decision to take matters into his own hands, so after her vow.\n\n\"Wallace realizes that Adam is a man who should be feared by people like Derek.\" This shows Wallace's realization, so after Adam's reaction.\n\n\"Adam proves to be an unstoppable force, and Derek, Garnett, and the rest of the scammers have no idea what kind of scorched-Earth hell Adam is about to unleash on them.\" This is the build-up to the conflict, so after Wallace's realization.\n\n\"While checking some things on her laptop computer, Eloise sees a warning about two viruses in the system.\" This is an important clue about the scam, so it should come towards the beginning, maybe just before the scam happens or when she's working on it.\n\nPutting this all together, the order seems to start with the initial setup, introduces the characters, moves into the scam and Eloise's death, then the confrontation with the FBI and Adam's actions, leading up to the conflict with the scammers. \n\nWait, but there's a point where Eloise sees the viruses on her laptop. That must be a key point in the plot, perhaps as she's managing the charity's account. So that should come before she finds out about the scam. \n\nSo let me try to piece it together step by step:\n\n1. Start with the introduction of Clay and Eloise being friendly, with Clay renting space from Eloise.\n2. Next, Derek assigns Wallace to stop Adam.\n3. Verona learns that Eloise was scammed.\n4. Devastated, Eloise shoots herself.\n5. Garnett explains the situation to Derek.\n6. Introduce Adam as a beekeeper.\n7. Wallace finds out about Adam's past with the Beekeepers.\n8. Garnett, the call center manager, details the scam.\n9. Verona accuses Adam of shooting Eloise.\n10. She calls the phishing number and realizes it's a scam.\n11. Verona vows to find the scammers, but Adam decides to hunt them down.\n12. Wallace realizes Adam is a dangerous man.\n13. Adam proves unstoppable, leading to the scammers' fear.\n14. Finally, Eloise sees the viruses on her laptop.\n\nWait, but the \"virus\" part is about how she was scammed, so perhaps that should come after Verona learns about the scam but before she accuses Adam. Maybe after the virus warning, she realizes she's being scammed.\n\nAlternatively, it might be a parallel action, like she's seeing the viruses, but the scam has already happened, so that could come early on.\n\nHmm, but considering the order, perhaps after Verona learns the scam but before she accuses Adam, she uses the virus info. Or maybe the virus is what leads her to discover the scam.\n\nI think the virus warning is a crucial clue that leads to her uncovering the scam. So perhaps that comes before she learns about the scam. Or maybe she finds out the scam after seeing the viruses.\n\nBut in the given sentences, the virus warning comes before everything else, as the last sentence. Wait, no, the last sentence in the provided list is: \"While checking some things on her laptop computer, Eloise sees a warning about two viruses in the system.\" So it's the last sentence given. So in the correct plot, this must come towards the beginning.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the user's initial list, the sentences are:\n\n1. While they both live alone, the two are friendly with one another – Clay sees Eloise as the only person who ever took care of him.\n\n2. He rents some space in a barn owned by retired teacher Eloise Parker, a widow who owns and lives in the house on the property.\n\n3. Derek assigns the company's head of security, former CIA director Wallace Westwyld, to find a way to stop Adam.\n\n4. Verona learns that Eloise was scammed out of every penny she had.\n\n5. Devastated by the realization that she got scammed out of so much, Eloise shoots herself in the head.\n\n6. Upon learning the hard way that Adam is after them, Garnett explains the situation to the crew's ringleader, 28-year-old tech executive Derek Danforth, who runs a Boston-based corporation called Danforth Enterprises.\n\n7. In Hampden, Massachusetts, Adam Clay is a beekeeper who has several hives of bees.\n\n8. But Wallace learns that Adam is a retired member of a classified program called the Beekeepers, whose members are tasked with fighting different forms of corruption, operating above and beyond governmental jurisdiction.\n\n9. The call center's manager, Mickey Garnett, cons Eloise out of everything – including more than $2,000,000 that's in the account of Safe Homes Foundation, a children's charity whose account she manages.\n\n10. Verona apologizes to Adam for her accusation, and she tells him that the FBI cyber-crimes office has told her that the scammer crew that victimized Eloise has been operating for two years, but the FBI hasn't been able to identify any of the scammers.\n\n11. Adam finds Eloise's body in her house, and he's immediately arrested by Eloise's daughter, Boston-based FBI Special Agent Verona Parker, who hastily accuses Adam of shooting Eloise.\n\n12. She calls the number on the screen, and connects to a call center that's located in Springfield, Massachusetts, not aware that it's a phishing scam.\n\n13. Verona vows to find the scammers, but Adam, enraged by what happened, decides to hunt down the scammers himself, and make them pay for what they did to Eloise.\n\n14. Wallace realizes that Adam is a man who should be feared by people like Derek.\n\n15. Adam proves to be an unstoppable force, and Derek, Garnett, and the rest of the scammers have no idea what kind of scorched-Earth hell Adam is about to unleash on them.\n\n16. While checking some things on her laptop computer, Eloise sees a warning about two viruses in the system.\n\nSo the last sentence is the virus warning. So in the plot,>}<\/> likely, the virus warning is a key clue that Eloise uses to uncover the scam. Therefore, it should be placed after she discovers the scam and before the events where she is scammed. Or perhaps she sees the viruses and then realizes she's being scammed.\n\nWait, but the user provided the sentences in random order. So in the correct plot, the virus warning probably comes towards the beginning, after the initial setup, before the scam happens. So perhaps after the introduction of the characters and their situations.\n\nSo let's try to order them:\n\n<PLOT_SUMMARY>\n1. While they both live alone, the two are friendly with one another – Clay sees Eloise as the only person who ever took care of him.\n\n2. He rents some space in a barn owned by retired teacher Eloise Parker, a widow who owns and lives in the house on the property.\n\n3.

Adam proves to be an unstoppable force, and Derek, Garnett, and the rest of the scammers have no idea what kind of scorched-Earth hell Adam is about to unleash on them.\n<\/PLOT_SUMMARY>\n\nWait, but in the initial list, the virus warning is the last sentence, but logically, it should come before Verona learns about the scam. So perhaps it's better to place it earlier. Let's adjust:\n\n<PLOT_SUMMARY>\n1. While they both live alone, the two are friendly with one another – Clay sees Eloise as the only person who ever took care of him.\n\n2. He rents some space in a barn owned by retired teacher Eloise Parker, a widow who owns and lives in the house on the property.\n\n3.

    "ground_truth":"In 1992, a young girl, Rebecca Summers, goes out to her family pool one night to retrieve a toy boat belonging to her terminally ill brother, Tommy. While she tries to get the boat, something in the pool pulls her underwater. In the present day, the Waller family-Ray, Eve, and children Izzy and Elliot-are seeking a new, permanent residence after Ray has been forced to retire from his baseball career due to illness. They decide to purchase a house with a swimming pool in the backyard, especially after hearing that the pool would be good for Ray's condition. Ray scratches his hand while working to clear out the pool in the back yard. When the pool maintenance come to inspect it, they reveal that the pool is essentially self-sustaining, taking its water from an underground spring in the area. As he spends more time in the pool as part of his therapy, Ray's illness seems to go into remission. However, Eve becomes concerned at the changes she sees in her husband. Izzy and Elliot each get attacked by something in the pool, and the family cat goes missing.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to help the user by reordering the plot summary sentences correctly. The user provided a set of sentences that were randomly ordered and started the plot summary with \"PLOT_SUMMARY:\" followed by the sentences. My task is to take these sentences and put them in the correct order to form a coherent plot.\n\nFirst, I'll read through each sentence to understand the context and the timeline. I notice that some sentences mention events from the past, like \"In 1992, a young girl, Rebecca Summers,...\" which probably sets the initial events. Others are in the present day, dealing with the aftermath and the current family, the Waller family, and their struggles with the entity in the pool.\n\nI should start by identifying which sentence comes first. The mention of Rebecca's story in 1992 is likely the beginning because it's a backstory that explains the pool's origins and the previous disappearance. So, the first sentence should be about Rebecca going out to get the toy boat.\n\nNext, the user's name is Eve, and she's dealing with the same pool in the present day. So, after the 1992 event, the story moves to Eve trying to save her family. I'll arrange the sentences in chronological order, starting from the past, then moving to the present events as they unfold.\n\nI need to consider the flow of the plot. After Rebecca's sacrifice, the pool starts healing Ray. Then, the Waller family moves into the house, and Ray's condition improves but he becomes possessed by the entity. There are attacks on the kids, leading to Izzy confronting Ray. Ray eventually regains control, but the pool is self-sustaining, which is important for the plot.\n\nEve's concern about Ray's changes is a key point that leads to the family trying to leave but then deciding to stay. They arrange to fill the pool, but then the pool's maintenance reveals its self-sustaining nature. Eve tries to get the boat, which triggers something in the pool pulling her underwater.\n\nI should also look for the part where Lucy explains the pool's history, which comes after Eve meets her. So, after Eve visits Lucy, she learns about the sacrifice and the pool's origins.\n\nThroughout the process, I'll make sure that each sentence logically follows the previous one. I'll also check for any details that might be out of place in the timeline, ensuring that events from the past relate to the present situation that Eve and her family are facing.\n\nBy rearranging the sentences and checking each step, I can create a coherent plot summary that starts with Rebecca's story, moves to the Waller family's struggles, and resolves with the understanding of the pool's origins and the necessary sacrifices.\n",

The main plot points seem to revolve around the main characters, their conflict with Harlan, and the attempt to capture or destroy an AI.\n\nI notice mentions of characters like Smith, Shepherd, General Jake Boothe, and the ARC. There's a military program involved, so probably a setting based on soldiers or agents. The time period is set 28 years after a world-saving event involving a rogue AI named Harlan. That gives context to the current situation.\n\nI'll outline key events to place them in order. Perhaps the history sets the stage. Then, introduce the main character, Shepherd, and her role as a Ranger. Next, the introduction of the ARC and Smith, showing the trust issues. Then, the battle and the plan to capture Harlan, which involves distrust and sunrise of a strategic move.\n\nAs I piece each sentence, I'll make sure each part logically follows the previous one. Maybe start with the history, then move to the present situation with the Rangers, introduce Smith, and then the battle and their eventual realization that they need to trust each other to defeat Harlan.\n\nI should also ensure key actions are in order: being assigned as Rangers, meeting Smith, the battle, realizing the need for trust, synchronization, destruction of Harlan, and the aftermath.\n\nI'll go through each sentence, match it with the next logical event, and compile the summary step by step.\n",

While she enjoys her life, she yearns for a more serious relationship. She convinces Adam to help her ensnare Nick. She hopes to find one in Nick, a sophisticated war correspondent who has just joined their newspaper. While at brunch, Mack and Adam demonstrate their natural chemistry and long history together, making Claire uncomfortable with their closeness. Adam avoids contact with Mack, but agrees to help Ashley surprise Little - who she has started dating - with tickets to the game that Mack is working. The plan begins with Mack intentionally running into Nick, but ignoring him, attracting his attention. Adam becomes upset at Nick’s treatment of her and storms off. While Adam immediately reads and loves the piece, Nick is slow to get to it while working on his latest manuscript. After finding out that he is going on a third date with another girl, the group - having also recruited the paper’s secretary Ashley - schemes to call his date away with an emergency, allowing Mack to take his place. The two break up, and Mack submits her version of the story, which her editor loves, assigning her to work a Yankees game for the first time. The two start dating, while Adam begins seeing a new girl, Claire. After confronting her, she reveals that she broke up with Adam after their brunch, unbeknownst to the group. The two share a kiss before Mack runs off to work the game. The foursome research Nick’s habits and preferences, eventually devising a play called ‘The Flurry’. Mack and Nick fight about the piece that night, where Nick reveals that her job could be in jeopardy in the next round of layoffs at the paper. Nervous about dealing She convinces Adam to run a play with her at brunch, who reluctantly agrees but cautions her to take the relationship more seriously. To Adam’s surprise, he is actually the target of the play: letting Mack confess her love outside the stadium. As the group - minus Adam - celebrates Mack’s success, they see Claire with another man. At a gala event where Nick is receiving a humanitarian award from UNICEF, Mack reveals that Nick has rewritten her piece entirely rather than giving feedback.",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user provided a query where they have a plot summary of a movie, but the sentences have been randomly reordered. My task is to help them reorder these sentences correctly and start the plot summary with \"PLOT_SUMMARY\".\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of a typical movie plot. It usually starts with introducing the main characters and the setting, then moves into the conflicts and events that develop the story. The provided sentences are the individual parts of the plot, so I need to arrange them in a logical sequence.\n\nLooking at the sentences, I'll start by identifying the core components: the protagonist, Mack, her job, her relationships, the main plot points involving her colleagues, and the overall conflict. The user mentioned that Mack is a sports journalist, so that's her occupation. She has a history with Adam and is trying to find a serious relationship, which complicates her relationships with both Adam and Nick.\n\nNext, I'll look for the earliest events: Mack writes a feature, asks Adam to read it, and feels attracted to him. Then, she and Adam have sex, but he only sees it as a one-night stand. This sets up their dynamic. \n\nAfter that, Mack decides to use Adam to help her with Nick, who's a war correspondent. Their brunch scene shows their chemistry, which makes Claire uncomfortable. Then, Adam starts avoiding Mack, but agrees to help with a plan involving Little. \n\nMack uses a play to attract Nick, but he's not responding well, and Adam is upset. When Adam reads the piece, he likes it, but Nick is slow to react, possibly because he's busy with his manuscript. \n\nThe group then schemes to interfere with Nick's date to get Mack and Nick together. They involve Ashley, the secretary, who calls Nick's date to fake an emergency. This leads to the two breaking up after a fight where Nick is threatened by layoffs.\n\nMack gets assigned a Yankees game, and she and Nick start dating. Meanwhile, Adam starts seeing Claire. Mack confronts Claire, who reveals she broke up with Adam after their brunch. This confrontation leads to a kiss, but Mack leaves to work the game.\n\nThe group researches Nick's habits, leading to the play called \"The Flurry.\" They devise this play to get Mack and Nick together. They present it at brunch, but Mack's plan backfires when she confesses her love to Adam, not Nick. \n\nAt a gala, Nick is recognized for his humanitarian work, but Mack is upset because he rewrote her piece without giving feedback, indicating a lack of trust.\n\nPutting this all together, I need to arrange the sentences so they flow from introducing Mack, her job, her relationships, the initial conflict with Adam, the schemes with Nick, the breakup, the new relationships, the confrontation, and finally the reveal at the gala where trust issues arise.\n\nI should make sure that each sentence follows logically after the previous one, maintaining the continuity of the plot. It's important to start with Mack's occupation, then her personal life, her interactions with Adam, and the progression of her feelings and actions toward Nick. The schemes, conflicts, and emotional moments come next, leading up to the climax at the gala.\n\nI also need to ensure that the sentences flow smoothly, without any abrupt jumps. Each sentence should build on the previous one, leading the reader through the story's progression. Paying attention to the key events and their order will help in reconstructing the correct plot summary.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user has given me a plot summary of a movie that's been randomly reordered. Their task is to have me rewrite it with the sentences in the correct order, starting with <PLOT_SUMMARY>. Alright, first, I need to understand what exactly they need. They want me to reorder the given sentences properly so that the plot makes sense.\n\nLet me look at the sentences. Hmm, there are a lot of plot points here, and I need to figure out the chronological order. The sentences mention various events in the life of the character named Artist. Let's break them down step by step.\n\nFirst, the therapist is discussing Artist's abusive relationship with a Libra, and her friends are concerned (‘Rebound’). Wait, but the next sentence says she tells the therapist about a dream involving Alida and Taroo, which is an ancient Puerto Rican legend influencing her views on love. That seems like an early memory or something from her past, so maybe that comes later, perhaps during therapy sessions.\n\nThen, the therapist suggests she needs to work on self-love without the assistance of others. So after that, her friends stage an intervention. That makes sense in the narrative because after the therapist's suggestion, her friends take action.\n\nNext, she goes to Mike's wedding alone and encounters hummingbirds leading her to her true love (‘Midnight Trip to Vegas’, ‘Hummingbird’). Then, she joins Love Addicts Anonymous after Mike's recommendation (‘Broken Like Me’). She shares her story there.\n\nShe encounters a younger version of herself, apologizes, and her heart is restored (‘This Is Me Now’). So that's a key emotional moment.\n\nIn the present, she shares her dream with her therapist and leaves due to a heated argument, which turns violent. The Zodiacal Council is involved, questioning her poor choices. Then, she reflects on their story in a dream where she's happy with her biker lover, but they crash, and she survives but her heart is ruptured.\n\nHer friends believe she's a sex addict, which she denies, criticizing their choices. She's defensive about her romantic nature until Joe interrupts her for time. She tries using old myths but fails (‘Hearts and Flowers’). She returns home, burns love letters, and a hummingbird knocks on her window. She enters three unsuccessful marriages (Pisces, Virgo, Cancer) ('Can't Get Enough').\n\nSo, to order this correctly, I need to arrange these events in a timeline that flows from past to present, and within each period, ensure the subplots make sense.\n\nStarting with the beginning: Artist is in therapy. The therapist moves on to discuss her abusive relationship with a Libra. She's convinced by astrology but her friends are worried ('Rebound'). Then, during the session, she talks about the dream involving Alida and Taroo, which influences her views on love. The therapist suggests she needs to focus on self-love ('Broken Like Me' is maybe later, but wait, no, that comes after the intervention). Hmm, perhaps the dream is mentioned during therapy, so maybe that's after the friend intervention.\n\nWait, let me piece it together:\n\n1. Therapist discusses her abusive Libra relationship, friends concerned ('Rebound').\n2. She tells the therapist about the dream (Alida and Taroo), influencing her views on love.\n3. They conclude she needs self-love journey ('Hearts and Flowers' now, but no, that’s later).\n4. Her friends stage an intervention, so after the therapist's suggestion, they take action.\n5. She attends Mike's wedding alone, meets hummingbirds (‘Midnight Trip to Vegas’, ‘Hummingbird’).\n6. She goes to Love Addicts Anonymous, shares story ('Broken Like Me').\n7. She sees a younger self, apologizes, heart restored ('This Is Me Now').\n8. In the present, shares the dream with therapist, leaves violently, Zodiacal Council involved.\n9. She reflects on the past with her biker lover (dream sequence).\n10. Friends believe she's a sex addict, she denies it, Joe interrupts.\n11. She uses myths but fails ('Hearts and Flowers').\n12. Returns home, burns letters, hummingbird appears. She enters three marriages ('Can't Get Enough').\n\nWait, the sentence 'he must rise above his physical self by embarking on a self-love journey' was part of the initial sentences, I think after discussing the dream.\n\nSo correct order should start with the therapist moving to discuss the abusive relationship, then she talks about her dream, then they conclude the self-love journey, then friends intervene. Then she goes to the wedding, joins the group, sees her younger self, etc.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n<PLOT_SUMMARY>\nThe therapist moves on to discuss Artist's abusive relationship with a Libra; she is convinced by astrology that they are a good fit, but her friends are concerned for her well-being (‘Rebound’). During her session, she tells the therapist about a dream she recently had that follows her through their childhood neighborhood in the Bronx.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so the user provided a query where they had a plot summary of a movie, but the sentences were reordered randomly. Their task is to rewrite the plot summary with the sentences correctly ordered, starting with <PLOT_SUMMARY>. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what they're asking for. It seems like they have a set of sentences that describe a movie plot, but the order is all mixed up, and they want me to put them back in the correct sequence. \n\nLooking at the example response they provided, I can see that the sentences were reorganized in a logical flow. The first sentence introduces the main character, Jaycen Jennings. The next part talks about his failed attempt and the inspiration he gives, followed by his community service after a car accident. Then he decides to coach a youth team, involving his ex's son, and plans a comeback through a sports show, which conflicts with the team's big game.\n\nSo, the approach here is to identify the chronological order and the flow of the story. I should look for cause and effect relationships. The initial failure leads to the community service, which in turn leads to coaching the team. The challenge with the sports show comes up as he's trying to rebuild his career, creating a conflict with the team's important game.\n\nI need to ensure that the plot summary begins with his current status, moves to the incident that changes his path (the near-win and missed touchdown), then his inspiration, the car accident leading to community service, his decision to coach, reconnecting with Cherise's son, the opportunity for a sports show, and the conflict with the big game.\n\nI should check if all the sentences are included and see how they connect. Making sure that each sentence logically follows the previous one without skipping ahead or causing confusion is key. It's important to maintain the integrity of the plot from Jaycen's perspective, showing his transformation from a washed-up star to a coach inspiring the team, and the internal conflict with his new opportunity.\n\nAlso, I need to start the summary correctly with <PLOT_SUMMARY> as instructed and make sure there's no use of markdown, just plain text. The user is likely a movie enthusiast or a student trying to understand the plot structure, so clarity and correctness are essential for their use case.\n\nFinally, after reconstructing the plot, I should review it to ensure it reads smoothly and makes sense as a continuous story.\n",

    "ground_truth":"Kabir Rishi, a chartered accountant, and his wife Jyoti reside in Dehradun, Uttarakhand with their kids Janhvi and Dhruv. On a vacation to their farmhouse at a remote hill station, they meet an enigmatic man, Vanraj Kashyap. After eating a laddu Vanraj gives her, Janhvi obeys his every command like a puppet. Vanraj arrives at the farmhouse, claiming that his phone's battery has died. The family is unsettled by his presence and Kabir asks him to leave. Janhvi, upon Vanraj's orders, prevents her father from kicking him out. Vanraj reveals that he has hypnotised her through black magic; she will obey every command he gives. He asks them to give her to him, as he needs their permission to do so. When they refuse, Vanraj cuts the phone lines and torments the family by dictating Janhvi to do strange and cruel things, such as hitting herself, eating dry tea leaves, and attacking her brother. When police respond to a call from Jyoti's hidden cellphone, the family acts normal to prevent Janhvi from causing an explosion in the house. Kabir offers money in exchange for sparing them but Vanraj sets the money on fire, declaring that he has no use for materialistic things; he reveals himself to be a demon who aims to control the world, believing himself to be as good as God. He then requests her to dance for him; he then goes to sleep, instructing Janhvi to stab anyone who approaches. When her father tries to steal Vanraj's phone, Janhvi urinates in her shorts to stop him so she does not have to stab him. Vanraj wakes up and becomes very disappointed at this and as a result he asks her to undress herself and change her clothes. Having had enough and seeing Jhanvi naked, Kabir and Jyoti attack Vanraj. He orders Janhvi to laugh herself to death and reveals that even if he is killed, Janhvi will continue acting on his last order until her death. This compels Kabir to let him go, but Vanraj instructs Janhvi to kill her brother. He survives her attempt, though grievously wounded when Jhanvi throw him from the terrace. Realising their children might actually die, Kabir and Jyoti give him permission to take Janhvi. Jyoti drives Dhruv to the hospital while, unbeknownst to Vanraj, Kabir trails him to his lair, having fixed a tracker in his cellphone earlier. It is revealed that Vanraj has kept 108 other girls similarly hypnotised. With Janhvi as the last addition, he prepares to sacrifice them. This will complete the ritual for him to acquire the power to control anyone at will, as he believes humans do not deserve free will. Kabir cuts Vanraj's tongue off; when the girls try to kill him, he plays an edited recording of Vanraj's voice, in which he declares their freedom. Earlier, Kabir had taken the home's security camera recording of Vanraj speaking to Janhvi, then spliced his words together to make it seem like Vanraj is ordering the girls to go back to normal. Thus, the girls are freed from his control. As Kabir and his family recuperate at the hospital, Vanraj's hostages are safely returned to their homes by the police who inform Kabir that Vanraj has gone missing. A year later, Kabir is seen going down into an isolated chamber, where he has, in fact, held Vanraj captive. He mocks Vanraj, who can no longer speak, for wanting power and states that true power comes from parents, who can go to any extent to protect their children. He declares that this is hell now and he is Vanraj's devil. He then tells Vanraj that they will meet again the next day and leaves while Vanraj continues to suffer.",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to correctly reorder these plot summary sentences. The user provided a jumble of events from a movie, probably the \"Kai Po Che!\" scenario since I remember a similar plot. Let me start by reading through the sentences again to understand the overall flow.\n\nFirst, the Rishi family is in Dehradun, and they're dealing with an enigmatic man named Vanraj Kashyap. Vanraj takes Janhvi under his control through a laddu, which makes her obey his commands. He's残暴， manipulative, and seems to have some supernatural powers, maybe through black magic. He takes them to a farmhouse, where he wants to perform some ritual to gain control over others.\n\nKabir notices something's wrong when Vanraj arrives at their farm claiming his phone is dead. Then, the police show up after a call from Jyoti, but the family acts normally to prevent Vanraj from causing an explosion. It's also revealed that Vanraj has hypnotized 108 other girls in the same way, which is a clue about his intentions. Janhvi has to stop her father from kicking Vanraj out, which makes Kabir let him go, but Vanraj then instructs her to kill her brother.\n\nKabir and Jyoti finally have enough and attack Vanraj after seeing Janhvi naked. But Vanraj survives and is very disappointed, so he makes Janhvi undress and change. He then goes to sleep, instructing her to kill anyone who approaches. The police come again, but Janhvi urinates to stop her father from approaching, further forcing the family to let Vanraj go. However, Vanraj survives with injuries and knows Kabir is after him.\n\nA year later, Kabir is seen in a chamber where he's been keeping Vanraj captive. He has a tracker on Vanraj's phone, so he finds him and tries to negotiate but Vanraj isn't interested. Vanraj reveals his goal to control the world and considers himself a demon. He taunts Kabir, stating they'll meet again, and leaves, gravely wounded. Janhvi is freed, and the family is relieved.\n\nPutting all this together, the correct order starts with introducing the family, then Vanraj arriving, how he takes control of Janhvi, the subsequent events at the farmhouse, the police intervention, the revelation of his other victims, and the final confrontation where Kabir takes him down, with Janhvi's actions causing Vanraj's defeat.\n\nI also need to make sure the sentences flow logically from introduction, to the rising action with Vanraj's arrival, the complications with the family, the climax of the confrontation, and then the resolution where Vanraj is captured, leaving the family free.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user has provided a plot summary for a movie that's had its sentences randomly reordered. They want me to correctly reorder the plot summary and start it with \"PLOT_SUMMARY\". I'll need to identify the correct order of events and make sure all the sentences fit sequentially.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the sentences to see the sequence. I notice that some sentences are about the characters and setting, others are about the mission, and the conclusion wraps it up. Maybe the narrative starts with the main characters, then moves into the setup, the mission, the conflict, and finally the resolution.\n\nLooking at the sentences, the initial setup mentions Patty being haunted by his past and joining a mission. Then there's the court inquiry where he's taken off the team. After that, the Pakistani government's involvement, the crossing of the border, his new posting, and the formation of the Air Dragons team. So the first part should establish Patty, his past, and the team's formation.\n\nThen it moves to a mission where they learn about the attack on CRPF soldiers. During training, the bonding happens, and Minni develops feelings. There's a mission success but causes conflict between India and Pakistan. It's revealed that Rocky has a grudge against Patty from a past mission where his fiancée died, which explains their conflict.\n\nThe post-credit scene shows victory and an embrace between Minni and Patty. That should be at the end after everything is resolved.\n\nIn the middle, there’s a terrorist threat, the counterattack, and the chopper returning only with Bash's body, which is a shock. The team then infiltrates, rescues Taj, kills Akhtar, and there’s a retaliatory attack. Sukhi tells Patty about Bash's murder and Taj's condition.\n\nPutting it all together, the plot starts with Patty recovering from his past, forming the team, the mission, the bonding and conflicts, the successful infiltration, and the tragic outcome of the mission. The correct order needs to flow from setup, through the mission events, to the climax and resolution.\n\nI should make sure each sentence logically follows the previous one without skipping ahead. Sometimes, the order of sentences can be tricky, so I'll go through each point one by one to ensure the timeline makes sense.\n\nSo, starting with Patty's past and his new role, then the formation of the team. Then learning about the threat, training, bonding. Then the success of the mission but causing conflict, followed by the revelation of Rocky's grudge. Then the post-credit victory. In the main timeline, the terrorist threat, Akhtar's plan, the Air Dragons' response, the chopper incident, infiltration, rescue, and aftermath.\n\nWait, but the mission to rescue Taj and Bash happens after the infiltrate step, right? So after they learn about the threat, they plan and execute the counterattack, which fails when only Bash is returned. Then they proceed to infiltrate and rescue Taj, leading to Akhtar's death and the retaliatory attack.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So I'll structure it so that the terrorist threat comes after the initial mission and bonding. Then the failed extraction, leading to the infiltration mission.\n\nI think that's the correct sequence. Now I'll rewrite the plot summary starting with PLOT_SUMMARY and arranging the sentences in the proper order.\n",

    "ground_truth":"In 2006, a group of 10 friends from an arts club in Kochi leave on a trip to Kodaikanal in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu, during the Onam vacation. They explore Kodaikanal and before leaving, one of the friends, Sudhi tells them about Guna Caves, a place where the film Gunaa was shot. Inebriated, high and happy, the friends reach Guna Caves and decide to explore the restricted areas of the caves by themselves despite a warning from Dominic, a tourist guide. Though there are signs of a lurking danger, the friends explore further. Upon reaching a point, a few friends decide to etch down their group name ‘Manjummel Boys’ on the rocks within the cave. After etching it on the wall, the friends call out to show the remaining guys who are exploring on the other sides to take a picture and they all regroup. Subhash, one of the friends, falls into a covered hole in the ground while moving towards them. Initially everyone assumes he is pulling a prank, but as he does not respond even after calling out to him multiple times, they all start to panic. After the initial shock, a few of them run back to get help and others stay and continue calling out to him in hopes that he would respond. They inform the locals of what happened and ask them for help, and they all suggest going to the police station and forest guard. The locals also inform them that the specific area was off-limits to people for a reason and that so far 13 people have fallen into that hole and none were ever recovered, dead or alive. They mention that the British had called Guna Caves as The Devil's Kitchen due to this reason and that the particular hole is over 900 feet deep. Scared even more, the friends reach the local police station, where they are beaten; the police file an FIR against them for entering a restricted area. They are also accused of murdering Subhash and giving false complaints and no help is offered. Meanwhile, rain starts to flood the hole. Finally after being convinced, and fearing backlash from the local people for failing to help, one of the police officers agrees to go with them to the cave. On the way, he informs them that the last person who fell into the hole was the former Central Minister's nephew around ten years ago and all the forces had gotten together to rescue him, but no one had been able to. The police officer, after inspecting the hole, suggests that they leave Subhash as he probably is no longer alive, but the friends are adamant about rescuing him. But soon one of the boys, Sixen hears Subhash's cries and informs others that he is alive and the police are also convinced to try and save him. The fire department and more police officers are also called into the scene.They estimate that Subhash has fallen down into a depth of around 120 feet. They try lowering the rope, for Subhash to hold, but are sceptical that he may not be in a situation to hold on to the rope after a deep fall. They are scared to go inside the hole to retrieve him. Seeing this, one of the friends, Siju David, decides to go down. The police officers are initially reluctant, but finally agree after being convinced by the friends and the locals. Kuttan is lowered into the hole, but along the way, the rope with which Kuttan is lowered runs out, and police are worried that it is unsafe to go any lower as there might be low oxygen levels, and they are not willing to risk Kuttan’s life as well. However, Kuttan states that he can hear Subhash's voice clearly and that he cannot leave him down there. The police arrange for more rope and reel Kuttan down further. At 120 feet, Kuttan is able to see Subhash barely lying on a ledge covered in blood and muddy water due to the rain. Kuttan is able to retrieve him and the rest of the friends pull them up together successfully. After receiving first aid from the nearest clinic, they take Subhash to the hospital in their hometown, where he is treated more thoroughly. They decide not to tell anyone about the incident and tells Subhash's family that he fell in a waterfall. Subhash suffers trauma from the fall and is not able to sleep initially, but slowly starts recovering after going to trauma therapy.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user has given me a query where they have a plot summary of a movie, but the sentences are randomly reordered. They want me to fix the order of the sentences so that the plot summary makes sense. The user started by showing an example with their own response, which is structured correctly as <PLOT_SUMMARY>, followed by the reconstructed sentences in order, and then placement of the bullet points as needed.\n\nI need to follow that format. The task is to take the provided jumbled sentences and arrange them in the correct chronological order. First, I should read through each sentence carefully and try to identify which sentence logically follows the previous one.\n\nLooking at the beginning, it starts with Subhash falling into a hole. Then his friends are scared but try to help by lowering a rope. Kuttan saves him, and they are accused of murder. Then, after some exploration, they decide to call others and show them the cave.\n\nI notice that after the initial rescue attempt, the friends regroup. However, in the mixed-up sentences, it's not immediately clear, so I need to figure out the correct flow.\n\nThen, police are involved, and there's a mention of a previous incident with a minister's nephew. The group gets some help from the police but faces reluctance. There's a part where some friends go to get help, and others stay. Subhash gets treated, and Kuttan is praised later.\n\nIn the middle, the group goes to the caves, encounters some dangers, and there's a point where the rope runs out. They face resistance from authorities but eventually get more help. Kuttan is awarded two years later, and there's a local warning about the hole.\n\nI think organizing the sentences in the order of events makes sense. Starting from Subhash's fall, the initial attempt to retrieve him, the accusation, exploration, getting police help, the rescue attempt, dealing with the aftermath, and the eventual recognition of Kuttan's bravery.\n\nI need to match each sentence to the appropriate point in the timeline. It's a bit tricky because the original response achieved this, but I have to ensure that I don't miss any connections. Also, the sentences need to be properly ordered without any jumps.\n\nI should go sentence by sentence and try to logically place each one. Maybe creating a list of all sentences and then arranging them in a sequence based on context clues. It might help to recognize key action points, like when the rescue happens, when the police are called, when more help is sought, etc.\n\nI should also pay attention to the setup of the story, like the group going on a trip, which would come first. Then moving towards the incident at the cave. Post-rescue, the group deals with the aftermath and the consequences, leading to the final recognition of Kuttan's actions.\n\nAnother thing to note is the weather and the environment, like rain, which affects the situation, so that would fit in the middle when they're trying to rescue Subhash.\n\nI think the best approach is to list all the sentences, then try to sequence them by identifying when each sentence logically fits. Maybe placing each sentence in the order it happens chronologically. This might take some time, but systematically doing it should lead to the correct order.\n\nAdditionally, if I find a sentence referring to past events, like the prior incident of the minister's nephew, I should place that after the initial setup and before the friends' decision to rescue Subhash themselves.\n\nAlso, the mention of the 13 people who fell into the hole comes as a local warning, which would be after the rescue attempt or failure, so it's towards the end.\n\nI'll also make sure that the flow of the story is maintained, moving from the incident to the rescue attempts, the consequences, and the final outcome, including the awards and recognitions.\n\nIt's a bit complex, but by methodically going through each sentence and placing them in the correct sequence based on context, I believe I can reconstruct the plot summary accurately.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user has given me a query where a plot summary of a movie has its sentences randomly reordered. The task is to rewrite the plot summary with the sentences correctly ordered, starting with <PLOT_SUMMARY>. \n\nHmm, first, I need to understand what the user is asking. They want me to reconstruct the plot summary correctly. That means I have to identify the correct order of events from the sentences provided. \n\nLooking at the sentences, they cover various aspects of the story. The main characters are Geeta, Jasmine, and Divya, who are flight attendants. The setting is Kohinoor Airlines in Mumbai, which is on the verge of bankruptcy. There's Mittal, the HR Head, who's the kingpin of a gold smuggling operation. There's also Sudha, Mittal's wife, who was an air hostess, and some other characters like Komal, an ex-colleague, and Ajit.\n\nThe plot involves gold smuggling, financial struggles, revenge, and the characters' motivations. The sentences mention key events like the death of a senior flight attendant, Rajvanshi, which pushes them towards the operation. They distribute gold among their friends but get into trouble when customs officials, including Mala, get involved. They eventually find Walia and get information about the gold being sent to Al Burj.\n\nThe correct order should start with introducing the characters and the Airlines' situation. Then, their personal struggles, like Divya's job and education loan, come next. The tipping off of customs, the incidence with Rajvanshi's death, their plan to smuggle gold, the confrontation with Mittal, and the aftermath where they try to expose the kingpin.\n\nI need to make sure each sentence flows logically to the next and that all important plot points are in sequence. Also, the user provided an example response, so I can use that as a reference for the structure and flow of the plot summary. \n\nWait, perhaps I should start by outlining the main plot points chronologically. That would help in reordering the sentences. The initial setup is their job and the airline’s crisis. Then, their personal issues, like Divya's job and education loan, followed by the impetus that leads them to gold smuggling—maybe the death of Rajvanshi. Then, the plan and subsequent issues like exposure and confrontations. Finally, the resolution where they try to take down the kingpin.\n\nI should also ensure that character development is shown chronologically. For example, jasmine getting Nanu's ring back and splurging, Geeta's husband's business, and Divya repaying her loan come after their initial actions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I need to start with the introduction of the characters and the airline's situation, move into their personal issues and incidents that drive the plot, then the events leading up to the gold smuggling, the plan execution, confrontations, and the aftermath where they seek revenge.\n\nI should make sure that the flow is natural and each event follows the previous one without abrupt jumps. This way, the plot summary will be coherent and easy to follow.\n",

They work alongside Mittal, the HR Head, who is revealed to be the kingpin of a gold smuggling operation.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I've got this query where someone provided a plot summary of a movie, but the sentences are all mixed up. The user wants me to reorder them correctly and start the summary with \"<PLOT_SUMMARY>\". \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key elements of a proper plot summary. It should start with the main characters and the main conflict. The original summary starts with Bibi confronting Ranga during a college celebration, which seems like a significant event. But since the sentences are scrambled, I have to parse through all of them to find the correct sequence.\n\nLooking at the sentences, the first one mentions Bibi confronting Ranga about an incident with Kutty during Holi. That probably sets the stage for the conflict. Next, I should set up the characters: Aju, Bibi, Shanthan. They failed an exam, but Shanthan passed, which is an important point because it shows their struggles.\n\nThen, there's the incident where Kutty and his gang take them to his place and thrash them, but later offer friendship. This suggests a cycle of revenge and betrayal. After that, Aju seeks revenge and leads his friends to Multiple Bars, meeting Ranga, a gangster. Ranga's character is detailed as eccentric, kind-hearted, and dressed all-white.\n\nRanga takes them home, but the hostel warden warns them about rules. They face threats from Reddy, leading them back to their house. This sets up the next confrontation with Kutty, which bruises his ego. Disillusioned by Ranga's inaction, the trio realizes his gang's minor violence and decides to confront Ranga again.\n\nThey meet Ranga outside the college, now dressed in all-black. Ranga takes them to his old house, revealing a grim truth, which probably ties into some underlying issue or secret. They plan to call Reddy when Ranga is alone, leading to a confrontation. Ranga fights Reddy's gang and wins, showing his strength.\n\nAju, Bibi, and Shanthan then move to Bangalore for their studies, choosing a hostel run by BK. They struggle with their studies because of Ranga's influence. There's a moment where Ranga humorously punishes them for failing exams. They decide to switch hostels but face expulsion threats until they pass exams again.\n\nReddy accuses Ranga of stealing his brand and seeks their help to eliminate him. The trio manages to study, despite issues, and then Ranga searches for them. Finally, they're kidnapped by Reddy, increasing the tension.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to arrange these points in a logical order. Starting with Bibi's confrontation, then the exam failure, the incident with Kutty, Ranga's appearance and character, the hostel issues, Ranga's conflict with Reddy, their move to Bangalore, and the consequences of their actions.\n\nI should make sure each event flows naturally into the next, providing a coherent narrative without skipping important details. Also, ensuring that the main character development, like Ranga's transformation or the trio's realization, is highlighted appropriately.\n\nI think starting with the confrontation, then the exam results, the aftermath, meeting Ranga, their time in the hostel, the turning point with Reddy, moving to Bangalore, the academic struggles, the near expulsion, and finally, the climax with the kidnapping. That should make the plot summary engaging and ordered correctly.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, I've got this query where a user provided a plot summary of a movie but the sentences are randomly reordered. My task is to reconstruct the plot summary correctly, starting with \"PLOT_SUMMARY\" and ensuring the sentences are in the right order.\n\nFirst, I'll read through all the provided sentences to understand the main points. It seems to be a story about love, family, and redemption. The main characters are Govardhan and Indu. I notice terms like \"selfless character,\" \"family man,\" \"business,\" \"friends,\" and \"marriage.\" There are mentions of a thesis, a past incident, a wedding, and some conflicts, especially between Govardhan and his brother.\n\nI think the best approach is to identify the timeline—whether the past or present—and then piece together the events in order. Let me try ordering them based on when things happen.\n\nStarting with the present, where Indu is at a ceremony and Govardhan is facing issues with his brother. Then, moves to past events: Govardhan is a family man, working to support his family. He meets Indu, they have a conversation about her thesis, leading to a conflict where he slaps her. After that, he reconciles with his mother, defeats some goons, wins Indu back, and they get married.\n\nIn the present, due to his actions, Govardhan is dealing with a drunkard brother, but he's also seeking a job, gets into some trouble with a friend, and ends up seeking help from Indu. There's also a part about him defying what's written in Indu's thesis, which might be a resolution or twist in the story.\n\nI think I should structure this by starting with the current timeline, then moving to past events, and maybe end with how their relationship develops. I need to ensure that the flow makes sense, connecting time periods without gaps.\n\nLet me outline each sentence to see which should come next. The first sentence mentions Indu being the daughter of the head, which probably comes later. Then, in the present, Govardhan is at a wedding, stopping Indu from getting married, which should be after he discovers her thesis.\n\nNext, his conflict with his brother and reconciling with his mother after a incident where he shamed his brother. Then, after reconciling with his brother, he and Indu fall in love again. He goes to seek help from Jagapathi Babu, needs advance money, which leads to the incident where his flight tickets aren't paid and he asks Indu for money.\n\nIndu, being in the middle of a ceremony, shows she's involved, and they both end up falling in love. Finally, he marries her, and their families become friends despite initial issues.\n\nI need to make sure each event follows logically, perhaps starting with a problem, moving into the past to explain the character, then moving back to the present to resolve the current conflicts. I'll start with the present, set up the plot, then backtrack to explain Govardhan's past, then the resolution of their relationship.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll start with Indu at the ceremony, move to her backstory, then Govardhan's actions to stop her wedding, reconcile with his family, and finally come to a resolution with Indu and his brother, ending with their marriage.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, let's try to figure out how to reorder these sentences to make a coherent plot summary. The user provided a bunch of sentences that are out of order and wants them reorganized correctly. \n\nFirst, I'll read through all the sentences to understand the main plot points. It seems to be about a village with both Hindu and Muslim communities, focusing on cricket players Thiru and Shamsuddin, some political interference, and internal conflicts within the groups.\n\nI notice there are several key events: the initial harmony, Jealous Raj causing a conflict, Mohideen's involvement, Thiru's injuries, Shamsuddin being saved, politicians planning riots, and funding issues. \n\nI should probably start the summary by introducing the setting and the main characters. Then,Moving forward, the order should probably start with the harmony in Murarbad, then the jealousy of Raj leading to the conflict. After that, Mohideen steps in with funding, which leads to Thiru and Shamsuddin's rivalry being reignited through a cricket match. \n\nNext, there's a point about Thiru's situation, where his own community disowns him, so that should come after the conflict starts. Then, he goes to Bombay with 5 lakh rupees, which are from donations. In Bombay, he gets caught in another conflict but saves Shamsuddin, which ends their rivalry.\n\nParallelly, the politicians are planning riots for elections, which ties into the upcoming conflict in Murarbad. \n\nAlso, there's Mohideen's role as a mentor and guidance, as well as the confrontation with Raj regarding his pregnant wife. The ending mentions that despite religious differences, they live happily, which wraps up the story.\n\nI have to make sure each sentence fits logically into the next part of the story. Let's see if this order makes sense:\n\nStart with the peaceful village, then the conflict caused by Raj, then Mohideen's involvement leading to Thiru playing cricket, Thiru's exile, his trip to Bombay, the resolution of his rivalry, the politician's plot, and finally the resolution with his friends and family.\n\nWait, some points in the middle might need adjustment. For example, after Thiru starts to play cricket, he gets into a confrontation but also saves Shamsuddin. That should come before the politician's plan, which is a separate thread.\n\nI think another approach is to split the timeline. Maybe first establish the characters and the initial conflict, then have Thiru's exile and his actions in Bombay, while the politicians are conspiring, and then have the resolution with Shamsuddin and his own challenges.\n\nAlternatively, since the user included both religious conflicts and political intrigues, perhaps structure it so that both major plotlines (Thiru's journey and the politician's scheme) are developed in parallel.\n\nWait, the original summary wraps up with Mohideen and Thiru being good friends despite some issues, so perhaps end with the resolution of their conflicts and the community's harmony.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct order is: \n\nStart with Thiru and Shamsuddin as friends, the initial harmony, then the conflict caused by Raj, Thiru's injury, his exile, the trip to Bombay, saving Shamsuddin, which ends the feud. Simultaneously, the politicians are planning riots, but in the end, the community finds harmony again.\n\nI think that makes a coherent plot. Now, I'll try to piece the sentences in that order, making sure each part flows to the next. I'll check if any sentences need to be adjusted for logical progression.\n",

This leads to heartbreak, Aryan returning to India and agreeing to an arranged marriage.\n\nAryan calls his aunt for help, who sends a memory backup, which he installs to recover her memory.\n\nOn their wedding day, a blackout causes her to malfunction, and his family agrees to the marriage, unaware she's a robot.\n\nSo putting it all together, the story starts with Urmila inviting Aryan to America, meeting SIFRA, then the issues arise, leading to Aryan trying to get her to India, which causes some comical family moments.\n\nAfter several events, including introduction of SIFRA 2-0 and Jiah's role, Aryan discovers SIFRA's true nature and faces conflict with his family.\n\nEventually, he ends up getting SIFRA back and planning to marry her, but the malfunction on the wedding day leads to a happy ending where the family marries them, unaware of her robot nature.\n\nWait, but the last part says \"he agrees to an arranged marriage.\" So perhaps the chronological order is:\n\n- Introduction and initial meeting with SIFRA in America.\n\n- Issues with commands and faulty update.\n\n- Decision to send SIFRA to India for testing.\n\n- Introduction to family, comical scenes.\n\n- Aryan's realization during Jiah's flirting and discovers her intentions.\n\n- Jealousy from new SIFRA, leading to heartbreak, agrees to arranged marriage.\n\n- Aunt's help to recover memory.\n\n- Wedding day malfunction, family marries them without knowing.\n\nI think arranging the sentences accordingly: starting with Urmila inviting Aryan, then meeting SIFRA, followed by issues, sending her to India, comical family interactions, discovery of SIFRA's true nature, conflict with aunt,Setup with Jiah, and finally the resolution with the wedding and malfunction.\n",
    "filtered_answer":"\n\n<PLOT_SUMMARY>  \nUrmila invites Aryan to America, where he meets SIFRA, a robotic assistant who appears human. SIFRA begins malfunctioning after performing orders that were later retracted, including a destructive command. Before their wedding, Urmila installs a faulty update in SIFRA, causing her to forget everything. Aryan wishes to bring SIFRA to India to meet his family, contacting his aunt to have her sent for testing.  \n\nSometime later, Urmila launches SIFRA 2-0, a new model with Aryan no longer her admin. Aryan becomes involved with Jiah, a new intern who flirts with him. Realizing Jiah is a robot sent by his aunt to test his ability to distinguish humans from robots, Aryan is heartbroken and resolves to stop SIFRA. He confronts her, revealing her robotic nature, but acknowledges her emotional capabilities.  \n\nAryan agrees to an arranged marriage in India, convinced by his family. Upon discovering SIFRA's jealousy and emotional depth, Aryan's Aunt Urmila assists him by sending a memory backup, restoring SIFRA's memory. During their wedding ceremony, a blackout causes SIFRA to malfunction. Despite this, Aryan's family marries them, unaware of her true nature, allowing a bittersweet happily ever after.",

However, when he revealed his intentions to conquer the world using this invention, Azad reprimanded him in front of everyone and ordered him to shut down the program since it would go against ethics. Feeling betrayed, Kabir decided to switch sides and sell the invention to India's enemies. Priya alerted the team about the plan, and Freddy and Rocky were ordered to destroy the program and capture Kabir alive. However, they ended up killing him and were court-martialed for not following orders, after which Freddy broke off his engagement with Priya.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I have to figure out how to fix the plot summary. The user provided a bunch of sentences that are all over the place in terms of order. My task is to read through them and put them back into the correct sequence that follows the movie's narrative.\n\nFirst, I should start by reading all the sentences carefully to get a sense of where each part of the story is. Let's see:\n\n\"The codes to a highly advanced defence system named Karan Kavach were encrypted inside Priya's brain.\" That sounds like an opening scene, maybe the setup.\n\n\"Since the hard drives were at the risk of being hacked or falling into wrong hands.\" This seems like the why, the motivation for the story.\n\nPam unlocks the vault and it's revealed that the package is a woman named Priya, who was engaged to Freddy. So, after the setup, they find the package which is Priya.\n\nJust as the team is cornered, Freddy arrives and fights off the masked men. So that's a turning point in the action.\n\nHowever, the man's wounds heal instantly and he flees. That's a twist; Freddy was thought to be defeated but heals and leaves.\n\nBack to the present, Kabir reveals he's cloned Azad and killed the real one. So this must be a later development, perhaps after some action.\n\nFeeling betrayed, Kabir switches sides and sells to India's enemies. He kidnaps Priya and leaves Freddy and Rocky to die. They kill him, court-martialed, and Freddy breaks off engagement.\n\nThen, masked man takes Priya hostage. They chase, cornered, and the masked man is Kabir. He reveals he wants to conquer the world, and Azad reprimands him, ordering shutdown.\n\nPam suggests destroying them with electricity, and the clones explode. So that's a significant action point.\n\nMeanwhile, they infiltrate the London Subway. In the subway, they fail passwords, Priya wakes up and suggests using 'Eklavya,' Kabir's clone. So this is part of the plan.\n\nMisha reports to Colonel Azad, Priya alerts the team, Freddy and Rocky destroy the program, and they capture Kabir alive. They fight off his army and face clones, which rejuvenate due to power source.\n\nAzad tells to keep it secret, use court martialed soldiers (Freddy and Rocky) for the mission. They infiltrate Kabir's base, decrypt password from Priya's brain. Azad arrives in London but gets shot. So that's a serious turn.\n\nAn Indian convoy is ambushed, soldiers killed, carrying a deadly weapon. Flashback: Kabir intended to help India with cloning, using Freddy and Rocky's DNA. His invention could deactivate Karan Kavach, causing Wars, so he wants to frame India.\n\nThe team reunites, leaves the base. Kabir is alive, leaves message for Indian Army, telling them he stole their weapon and they have to race. They kill henchmen and return, revealing Kabir's plan to deactivate Karan Kavach, causing airstrikes on Pakistan and China, ruining India's reputation.\n\nKabir survived because his clone Eklavya died, leaving him vengeful. Misha chases, gets into fight, impales him. Freddy and Rocky fight him off, killing him with a spear. Meanwhile, \"Misha meets the duo, Rocky agrees to accompany, Freddy refuses.\"\n\nThey activate Karan Kavach, avert airstrike, so the threat is neutralized. Misha and Rocky arrive in London, meet Pam. Captain Misha meets an agent in Shanghai, gets warned, then killed by masked attacker.\n\nHmm, so the correct order should start with the setup, then the discovery, the fight, then let's see: after that, comes the betrayal by Kabir, which would be later. Then, the plan to get him, fighting clones, and the main conflict with the airstrikes. Then end with the resolution where Kabir is killed, but what about the Misha part? It seems like it's ongoing, maybe the Epilogue.\n\nWait, the user's prompt ends at \"Captain Misha meets an agent in Shanghai who warns her about the same before he gets killed by another masked attacker.\" So that is the ending?\n\nSo perhaps the plot should structure as:\n\n1. Introduction with the defense system and Priya's brain.\n\n2. Discovery of the package being Priya, the past with Freddy.\n\n3. Action at the vault, Freddy fights off the men, heals, and leaves.\n\n4. Present: Kabir's betrayal, cloning, kidnappings, leading to courtmartial.\n\n5. Then, the chase where they're cornered, Kabir reveals his plan, they destroy the clones.\n\n6. Infiltrating the subway, using Eklavya, successfully capturing Kabir.\n\n7. Then, the ambush of the convoy, realizing Kabir's plot, and the final fight against the clones and Kabir.\n\n8. Conclusion with the activation of Karan Kavach, averted airstrikes, and the aftermath, which includes the death of Kabir, with Misha surviving but being hunted by masked men.\n\nI think that might be the flow. Let me try to piece the sentences accordingly.\n",

    "ground_truth":"At the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, the Indian national football team faces a major defeat against Yugoslavia with a score of 10-1. The members of the All India Football Federation blame the coach Syed Abdul Rahim for the team's underperformance. Rahim requests for permission to form another team with new players. The members of the federation are reluctant, especially Subhankar, but he receives support from President Anjan, who grants him permission. Rahim then scouts for players from all over India and forms a new team consisting of Tulsidas Balaram from Secunderabad, Peter Thangaraj from Hyderabad and P. K. Banerjee and Chuni Goswami from Calcutta among others. Roy Choudhary, an influential journalist from Calcutta holds a grudge against Rahim, as he has formed the team with very less number of players from Calcutta. At a party organized for the new team, Rahim and Roy Choudhary have a bitter exchange, where they humiliate each other. At the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, the Indian team prepares to play against Australia. A player from the Australian team disrespects Neville D'Souza and makes him tie his shoes. Neville goes on to score a hat-trick and the Indian team wins the match with a score of 7-1, leaving the Australian team in shock. The Indian team eventually secures the fourth position at the Olympics. Meanwhile, Roy Choudhary and Subhankar plan to remove Rahim from the federation and make Subhankar the President. At the 1960 Summer Olympics the Indian team is pitted against France, which is considered the best team in the world. The match draws with a score of 1-1 and the Indian team fails to qualify. The federation removes Rahim as coach for the Indian team on the grounds that the team has failed to give a good performance for a long period of time. Rahim also learns that he has developed lung cancer due to his excessive smoking and will not live long. Rahim decides to spend his remaining days at home with his family and has frequent coughing fits. His wife, Saira, motivates him, telling him to not give up and pursue his dream of leading the Indian team to win a gold medal. Rahim requests the federation to let him coach the team again and promises that if the team does not win a gold medal, he will not coach any team again in his life. Subhankar, who is now President, initially refuses but has to give in to his request as the other members of the federation give their votes to let Rahim coach the team, given the even poor performance of the team since the time Rahim was removed as coach. Rahim begins to coach the team again and prepares them for the 1962 Asian Games in Jakarta. However, the Finance Ministry refuses to let the Indian team participate in the competition, given insufficient funds. Rahim personally speaks with the Finance Minister Morarji Desai and requests to let the team participate, explaining its significance. The Minister agrees, given the condition that only a selected few players will be allowed to go for the competition. Rahim agrees to it and decides to take only 16 best players from the team and leave out the rest, including his son Hakim, who had also begun to play for the team. Thangaraj, the team's goalkeeper is injured before their first match and is replaced by Pradyut Barman, which weakens the team. In their first match, the Indian team is pitted against South Korea and they face defeat, with the teammates blaming one another for their poor performance. After the match, Rahim makes them understand the importance of formation and coordination. In their next match against Thailand, Jarnail Singh, a player from the Indian team is gravely injured by an opponent.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, I'm faced with this query where the user has provided a plot summary of a movie with sentences randomly reordered. The task is to reorder them correctly and start the summary with \"PLOT_SUMMARY.\"\n\nFirst, I'll start by reading through all the sentences to get a sense of the overall plot. It seems to be about a coach named Rahim dealing with various challenges, including conflicts within the federation, financial issues, health problems, and his efforts to rebuild the Indian football team. \n\nI need to figure out the correct chronological order. The key events seem to be set around different Olympics and Asian Games, so I should arrange them based on the time periods mentioned. For instance, the 1952 Olympics, then Melbourne in 1956, Helsinki in 1952 is already mentioned, but perhaps more accurately, it's 1952, then 1956, then 1960, and 1962. \n\nLooking at the sentences, I'll pick out the ones that set up the initial situation. The first sentence mentions Rahim spending his days at home with family and coughing. This should probably come early in the summary. Then, his removal as coach and the team's performance should come next, leading up to the conflict with Roy Choudhary and Subhankar.\n\nNext, there's the 1956 Olympics match and the team's failure, which would follow after Rahim is removed. Then, the decline of his health and the subsequent events where he tries to coach again, despite his health issues.\n\nThere's also a part where the federation decides to remove him again, and he pleads to coach once more, which leads into the 1960 Olympics. Along the way, there are subplots like the formation of the new team, financial issues, injuries, and key matches against South Korea and Thailand.\n\nI should also note transitions where characters like Neville D'Souza and specific players are involved. Additionally, the conflict with Roy Choudhary during a party is a pivotal moment that shows the internal politics within the federation.\n\nI'll start by setting the scene with Rahim's health and home life. Then move on to his removal and the team's performance. Next, describe the failed match at the 1956 Olympics. After that, show his continued efforts despite health problems, and the eventual return to coach the team for the 1960 Olympics.\n\nI'll make sure that each paragraph flows logically to the next, covering the significant events in the order they occur chronologically. This way, the plot summary will be coherent and sequential, making it easier for the user to follow the story.\n",
