      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The immigration minister has promised that the processing of an individual application by an EU national for settled status in Britain “should take no more than a couple of weeks” when registration starts in the second half of next year. The minister, Brandon Lewis, told the Commons home affairs select committee that an extra 1,200 UK visas and immigration staff were being recruited to process an expected 3.5m applications from EU nationals over two and a half years. He also told MPs on Tuesday that he was optimistic that an agreement could be struck by Christmas on the rights of EU citizens in the UK in the Brexit negotiations. However, he declined to comment on reports that the Brexit inner cabinet had decided on Monday that the European court of justice could continue to play a role in guaranteeing their rights during a two-year transition period. The Home Office minister did confirm that those refused “settled status” and classed as non-EU nationals in Britain illegally could have their bank accounts frozen and face deportation before the hearing of any appeal in British courts. The 3million group, representing EU nationals in Britain, immediately questioned Lewis’s claim that an agreement with the EU on “settled status” was likely before Christmas. “We wonder how. Major stumbling blocks still in place,” they tweeted, noting continued differences over the role of the ECJ, over family reunification rights that could affect thousands, and regarding clarification that they should not face “hostile environment measures”. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, voiced scepticism that an extra 1,200 staff – of whom 700 had already been recruited – would be sufficient when the UK Visas and Immigration agency (UKVI) currently used 6,500 staff to process 3m visa applications a year. There was already a three-month delay in processing EU nationals’ applications for permanent residence documents, she said.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The album was melancholic, yet a fragment of defiance against the listless humdrum. This was what she persisted with. It was possible to run away from all she once knew, and this realization felt as liberating as the Olympic flame.\n\n\"All the Way to Rio\" marked this transformation, a welcome rebellion to the production she despised.

Not in the strictly financial sense, though how much more threadbare core public services can become without collapsing and causing social mayhem the next few years will prove, if the government lasts. Even with faltering economic growth, public spending is to go on falling as a proportion of GDP. It’s bankrupt in ideas, in understanding, in preparedness to examine what has been happening to public services. Housing offers a glaring example. For all the bells and whistles in the budget, and some welcome augmentation of council powers, the government fails to make an obvious connexion. Building houses, allocating land, encouraging development, and policing the delinquency of private developers all imply an active and financially lubricated local government. Housing is and always will be about places, streets, brownfields – and public acceptance of schemes that will abut on their property or where they walk their dog. That’s what councillors do.

Not in the strictly financial sense, though how much more threadbare core public services can become without collapsing and causing social mayhem the next few years will prove, if the government lasts. Even with faltering economic growth, public spending is to go on falling as a proportion of GDP. It’s bankrupt in ideas, in understanding, in preparedness to examine what has been happening to public services. Housing offers a glaring example. For all the bells and whistles in the budget, and some welcome augmentation of council powers, the government fails to make an obvious connexion. Building houses, allocating land, encouraging development, and policing the delinquency of private developers all imply an active and financially lubricated local government. Housing is and always will be about places, streets, brownfields – and public acceptance of schemes that will abut on their property or where they walk their dog. That’s what councillors do.

The beloved Russian song repertoires came to the west thanks to Hvorostovsky and his accompanist Ivari Ilja. He was able to gain even more acclaim for his performances of Verdi, and the public adored him for every minute spent on the stage.\n\n***\n\nDespite his euphoric journey in music, the final years of his life were overshadowed by a struggle against brain cancer. After a two-and-a-half-year battle with the illness, Dmitri Hvorostovsky died in 2017, leaving a rich legacy.

    "filtered_answer":"<|begin_of_thought|>\nThe given sentences seem to be part of a film review or critique, which I can use as inspiration to create a new story. I shall establish a plot, characters and setting that aligns with the noir genre mentioned.

I will establish a plot involving the writing career of Dix, his predatory intentions, and the transition when introduced to Laurel.\n\nI need to write a story that moves along like a jigsaw puzzle, revealing the characters and their evolving dynamics piece by piece, complying with the request for 4 paragraphs and the 'truck' start.\n\nTruck appears to be a random word for a paragraph to start but I could relate it with Dixon's journey or Laurel or Mildred.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Philip Hammond must borrow an extra £90bn over the next five years after the Treasury’s independent forecaster downgraded productivity growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that the chancellor faced a long period of lower than expected wages growth that would dent tax receipts and push up borrowing. The cumulative effect over the life of the parliament would add £90.5bn to the UK’s debt pile and jeopardise Hammond’s target of balancing the government’s books by 2025, it said. The Treasury said that once the positive effects of an increase in employment and better than expected borrowing over the last year are taken into account, the net borrowing rise would be £35bn, putting the chancellor in a position to reach his target of creating a surplus in the middle of the next decade. But some analysts said the OBR’s revision failed to go far enough and it continued to overestimate the capacity of British businesses to invest in new equipment and processes to drive up productivity. They argued that the forecaster should have gone further and predicted that productivity growth – which measures the average output per hour worked – of almost zero over the last seven years would continue for another five years. Joanna Davies, a UK economist at Fathom Consulting, said the OBR’s new forecast that productivity would increase at a rate of 1.1% until 2022 – almost half the 2.1% average seen in the 30 years before 2007 – still looked ambitious. She said the prospects for GDP growth would suffer a severe knock-on effect from lower productivity and a rapidly ageing population. “Over the last five years, productivity growth has averaged just 0.3%,” she said. “Combined with UN projections for working-age population growth, the UK’s trend rate of overall economic growth is probably somewhere in the range 0.5%-1% – around half the 1.5% assumed by the OBR.” The OBR chair, Robert Chote, said GDP growth would not only be hit by lower productivity, but also a weaker than expected export sector that would fail to benefit significantly from the lower pound.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n MPs have been forced to deny that a Commons vote last week means animals are not recognised in the UK as sentient life forms. An amendment to the European Union (withdrawal bill to transfer the EU protocol on animal sentience into UK law was defeated by 313 votes to 295 on 15 November, and since then a row has developed as to what the vote meant in practice. Describing some of the reporting on the vote as “weird and dishonest”, Tory MP Zac Goldsmith tweeted a clarification that the vote had been about the correct legal procedure for ensuring animal welfare standards – not on the principle of whether animals are sentient. Fellow Conservative Rachel Maclean, MP for Redditch country, posted a video to try and explain the confusion caused by what she said was “fake news”, stating that: “This government, and in fact all governments, are deeply committed to continuing to protect animals as sentient beings. That law is already written into our own law.” Theresa May said at Wednesday’s PMQs: “We recognise and respect that animals are sentient beings, and should be treated accordingly.” Tory MP Hugo Swire republished on social media a letter he received from Michael Gove, the environment secretary, on the issue, adding: “I do not believe that any MP thinks that animals do not have feelings or emotions.” Nevertheless, the vote has triggered protests from animal rights groups, including multiple online petitions aimed at the House of Lords, UK parliament and Gove. Public figures including the presenter Sue Perkins have voiced strong criticism of MPs over the issue. Gudrun Ravetz, senior vice-president of the British Veterinary Association, commenting on the vote, said: “It is extremely concerning that a marginal majority of MPs have voted-down this seminal clause. This action undermines the government’s previous promises that the UK will continue to be known for our high standards of animal health and welfare post-Brexit.” However, Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley, pointed out that EU law still allowed many practices across Europe that animal rights groups oppose. The amendment, proposed by the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas, among others, had set out to specifically incorporate article 13 of title II of the Lisbon treaty into UK law. During debate on the amendment last Wednesday, Lucas pointed out that the origins of the clause began with the 1997 UK presidency of the EU and that from 1999 EU law had explicitly recognised that animals were sentient life forms.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Fellow Conservative Rachel Maclean shared a video to explain the confusion caused by what she claimed was \\\"fake news.\\\" She stated, \\\"This government, and in fact all governments, are deeply committed to continuing to protect animals as sentient beings.\\\" \\n\\nTheresa May addressed the issue at Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions, confirming, \\\"We recognize and respect that animals are sentient beings, and should be treated accordingly.\\\" Tory MP Hugo Swire shared a letter he received from Environment Secretary Michael Gove on the matter, and he stated that he believes no MP thinks that animals do not have feelings or emotions. \\n\\nDespites these clarifications, the vote has triggered protests from animal rights groups. There are multiple online petitions aimed at the House of Lords, UK Parliament, and Gove. Public figures, including the presenter Sue Perkins, have expressed strong criticism of MPs over the issue. Gudrun Ravetz, Senior Vice-President of the British Veterinary Association, weighed in on the vote, saying, \\\"It is extremely concerning that a marginal majority of MPs have voted down this seminal clause. This action undermines the government's previous promises that the UK will continue to be known for our high standards of animal health and welfare post-Brexit.\\\" \\n\\nOn the other side, Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley, argued that EU law still permits many practices in Europe that animal rights groups oppose. The amendment, proposed by the Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas, among others, sought to incorporate article 13 of title II of the Lisbon treaty into UK law. Lucas reminded MPs that the origin of the EU clause was rooted in the UK's 1997 EU presidency, and from 1999, EU law had explicitly recognized animals as sentient life forms.\"\n}\n} <|end_of_solution|>",

    "response":"\"Recently, the Guardian's archives offered an interesting glimpse into a distant echo of the modern football experience, a tale that takes us back to January 1907. The piece began with Liverpool's match at Sunderland, echoing timeless truths about sports and human nature–no matter how much time passes, some things never change. Despite having established a dominant 4-1 lead at the half-time mark, the Liverpool squad couldn't quite seal their victory. The article painted a vivid picture of the early 20th century match at Roker Park, recalling the achievements of Liverpool players such as Jack Parkinson, Sam Raybould and Jack Cox. All three were hailed for their scintillating performance and sheer attack prowess, likened to a fleet of ships invading the furious sea.\n\nHowever, the term 'never change' takes on a new, dark meaning when summed into the second half of the match. Despite their earlier achievements, Liverpool suddenly started conceding rash fouls and even a penalty kick. This downward spiral, according to Manchester Guardian that was not yet transformed into a more socially aware publication, could be attributed to Liverpool's shift from what they termed 'the clean game', noting this transition as not necessarily reflecting weakness or inefficiency but instead a moral dilemma.\n\nThe end story reads like a reminder of the fickle nature of sports and its fan's moods. Sunderland's comeback was sensational, resulting in a stunning tie at 5-5. Just when it seemed that Liverpool was going to cement their dominance, their psychological and tactical guard dropped, culminating in the first instance where they had ever surrendered a three-goal lead. \n\nThis observation begs the question—is there some buried narrative in the collective psyche of Liverpool athletes or the fan base that goes beyond mere tactics or team dynamics? Or is this simply a cautionary tale of the unpredictability of sports and the importance of maintaining a steady hand in the face of adversity? The Guardian article leaves us pondering these questions, inviting us to reflect on our own experiences with victory, uncertainty, and the joy of sports. Reflecting on this, it’s crucial to carry forward the spirit of resilience and perseverance in every form of the game, be it in the humble court of a public primary school or the extravagant Stadiums, much as the Liverpool and Sunderland players did in 1907.\"",

It lists properties that can cater for a range of disabilities, highlighting details such as step-free access, hoists, roll-in showers and shower chairs. The site, now run by a team of six, with more than500 listings in 60 countries, grew rapidly thanks to a grant from the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, part of Oxford University’s Saïd Business School, and a further £300,000 funding from “angel” investors. Now, Accomable’s team and listings will be merged with Airbnb’s. In the coming months, the listings will be made available via the Airbnb site, and the team says it will now work towards improving the overall Airbnb experience for disabled travellers. Airbnb is also developing an “accessibility needs” checklist that allows hosts to be more descriptive about their home. In an open letter posted on its site, Madipalli reassured customers that the merger with a larger platform won’t mean accessibility becomes an “afterthought”. “Our decision to join Airbnb was one that we spent a long time considering,” he says. “Our work has allowed us to develop unrivalled expertise in the world of accessible travel, building a brand that disabled travellers can trust.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has promised to donate part of her fee from appearing in I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here to a homeless charity as she defended her decision to appear in the show. Dugdale rejected complaints from her Labour colleagues at Holyrood that taking part in the ITV reality show was akin to taking a second job, but admitted she would be well paid for it. Speaking to show-business reporters in Australia for the first time since her participation provoked a backlash from other Labour MSPs, Dugdale insisted the show would allow her to connect with voters. She said she had set aside three weeks’ salary as an MSP for the Rock Trust homeless charity and not a motor neurone disease campaign as previously thought.

Dugdale rejected complaints from her Labour colleagues at Holyrood that taking part in the ITV reality show was akin to taking a second job, but admitted she would be well paid for it. Speaking to show-business reporters in Australia for the first time since her participation provoked a backlash from other Labour MSPs, Dugdale insisted the show would allow her to connect with voters.

    "response":"<|begin_of_thought|>\nThe task involves constructing a story from the initial sentences of a Guardian news article. \\n\\nFirst, let's break down the key elements of the sentences:\n- Brahms chose the text of his German Requiem in the German language.\n- The Requiem was first introduced to London in English, accompanied by Brahms's own piano for four hands.\n- The story discusses a new recording that uses a similar setup as the original but adjusts the piano part to resemble Brahms's orchestration.\n- The recording has an intimate chamber performance style, with a young choir and a soloist named Mary Bevan, whose solo is highly praised except for issues with diction. \\n\\nNext, the story will need to encompass these elements within a narrative context. The narrative could include:\n- Background on Brahms and his Requiem.\n- The significance of choosing the text in German and then performing it in English.\n- Historical context about the original performance which took place in London's Wimpole Street.\n- Description and critique of the modern recording, the choir’s performance, and the soloist.\n- Mentioning the mixed appreciation due to the singer's diction problem. \\n\\nIt's critical that the story smoothly connects these points and stays true to the style of the Guardian news article while telling a more developed story. In this narration, there should be attention to context, vivid description, and a smooth flow to maintain reader interest. Lastly, ensure to end the story with the given exact phrase. Posing the requirement for the postscript, this allows for a unique addition to the end of the response.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nIn 1868, Johannes Brahms composed his German Requiem, a celebration of life and lamentation for the dead.

It mirrors the forces that gathered during the Wimpole Street drawing room performance of 1871, yet it offers a fresh interpretation by revising the piano part to resonate more deeply with Brahms’ orchestration. This reworking produces an intimate, intimately charged chamber performance that is colorful and lively, albeit occasionally a bit too light-handed, executed by a young choir.\n\nThe performance, while overall divine, encounters a slight miscalculation – the solo performance by Mary Bevan, where commendable clarity and skill do not compensate for the blur of diction, which clouds an otherwise divine solo.\n\nThis recording is a testament to the enduring musical legacy of Brahms, juxtaposing nostalgia for the past with contemporary interpretation.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Google has confirmed it has been able to track the location of Android users via the addresses of local mobile phone masts, even when location services were turned off and the sim cards removed to protect privacy. Revealed by a report by Quartz, Google’s Android system, which handles messaging services to ensure delivery of push notifications, began requesting the unique addresses of mobile phone masts (called Cell ID) at the beginning of 2017. The information was captured by the phone and routinely sent to Google by any modern Android device, even when location services were turned off and the sim card was removed. As a result Google could in theory track the location of the Android device and therefore the user, despite a reasonable expectation of privacy. A Google spokesperson said: “In January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery. “However, we never incorporated Cell ID into our network sync system, so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated it to no longer request Cell ID.” Google requested the Cell ID alongside what is called the mobile country code and mobile network code, which identify the country and mobile phone operator that the smartphone is using. That data is used to ensure the phone stays properly connected to Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging system, which handles the delivery of messages and notifications to the smartphone. A persistent connection is required for the system to work, but instead of staying constantly connected, the phone pings Google’s servers at set intervals. The more pings, the greater the battery drain, so the data collected about the country and mobile networks is used to work out the the minimum number of pings required to stay connected without draining the battery – so called heartbeat analysis. The benefit of having the address of the mobile phone mast to ensure message service reliability is not clear, but through a process of triangulation – the same used to assist when a user is actively using location services – the position of the user can be revealed down to a roughly 400m radius at a minimum, and often much more accurately in urban areas.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Here is one of the final screen appearances of Emmanuelle Riva, icon of movies from Michael Haneke’s Amour to Gillo Pontecorvo’s Kapò and Alain Resnais’s Hiroshima Mon Amour, who died in January at the age of 89. It is a delectably gentle, elegant, self-effacing performance. Riva plays a lovably scatty old lady called Marthe in this Tati-esque comedy from French writer-directors Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon. The movie they have jointly devised, and in which they star, is a clever, funny and distinctly unworldly comedy with an insouciant line in visual humour. Fiona (Fiona Gordon) is a young goof from Canada who comes to Paris to visit her similarly away-with-the-fairies aunt Marthe (Riva). A mishap on the banks of, and then in, the Seine leads to an encounter with a romantic tramp called Dom (Dominique Abel). It’s a classic French entertainment that could have been produced almost any time in the last 60 years. There is a sophistication in its childlike guilelessness and also a cameo for veteran French comedy player Pierre Richard. This movie is as sweet-natured as Abel and Gordon’s debut film Rumba, and they break out some serious tango movies here, too. It’s a little gem.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['fire', 'meeting', 'quote', 'society', 'wheel'] in the response.

It is a delectably gentle, elegant, self-effacing performance. Riva plays a lovably scatty old lady called Marthe in this Tati-esque comedy from French writer-directors Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon. The movie they have jointly devised, and in which they star, is a clever, funny and distinctly unworldly comedy with an insouciant line in visual humour. Fiona (Fiona Gordon) is a young goof from Canada who comes to Paris to visit her similarly away-with-the-fairies aunt Marthe (Riva). A mishap on the banks of, and then in, the Seine leads to an encounter with a romantic tramp called Dom (Dominique Abel). It’s a classic French entertainment that could have been produced almost any time in the last 60 years. There is a sophistication in its childlike guilelessness and also a cameo for veteran French comedy player Pierre Richard. This movie is as sweet-natured as Abel and Gordon’s debut film Rumba, and they break out some serious tango movies here, too. It’s a little gem.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['fire', 'meeting', 'quote', 'society', 'wheel'] in the response.

Riva stars in this delightful comedy as Marthe, a charmingly eccentric elderly woman. Both the director and the audience are invited to remember old-fashioned cinematic charm and timeless stories through this clever, funny, and distinctly unworldly comedy.\n\nSection 2\n\nOur story begins with a meeting between two characters, Fiona and Marthe. Fiona, played by Fiona Gordon, is a young woman from Canada who comes to Paris to visit her similarly whimsical aunt, Marthe, played by the late Emmanuelle Riva. The pair embarks on a series of adventures through the streets of Paris, encountering a romantic tramp called Dom (Dominique Abel) along the way.\n\nSection 3\n\nAt a pivotal moment, while admiring the iconic wheel of the Eiffel Tower, a fire breaks out at a nearby old cinema. This prompts Marthe to rally her bravery, leaving behind her eccentric yet endearing personality for a moment. She quotes the lines, \"In times of adversity, it's our duty to act, no matter how foolish we may appear,\" a saying she often reminds Fiona of. Marthe rushes into the fire and rescues a series of classic films that she deems worth saving at all costs.\n\nSection 4\n\nIn the aftermath of her heroic escapade at the burning cinema, Marthe is invited to join a society dedicated to preserving and maintaining classic French comedies. This gives her newfound purpose for the rest of the film, highlighting the broader theme of the movie: the preservation and love of timeless, yet whimsical, cinematic traditions.\n\nSection 5\n\nP.P.S: The film ends on a note of sweetness and nostalgia, much like the first sentence from the review suggested. Emmanuelle Riva's final film performance may not have been her most dramatic, but it stands as a testament to her lasting impact on the film industry and the enduring charm of classic French cinema.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has become embroiled in a bizarre Twitter row with the comedy actor Ralf Little over the state of NHS mental healthcare. The standoff began two weeks ago after Hunt’s appearance on The Andrew Marr Show, when Hunt stated that the NHS had overseen “the biggest expansion of mental health provision in Europe”. Little, best known for his role as Anthony in the sitcom The Royle Family, accused the health secretary in a tweet of “knowingly lying” to the public about statistics and told Hunt to sue him if he was wrong. Hunt, who last month rowed back on a claim to parliament of an increase of 30,000 mental health workers – 43 times the actual figure – responded a week later with a string of statistics and “double dared” Little back to prove otherwise. He tweeted: The actor then posted a thread of more than 40 tweets rebutting the health secretary’s claims, including statistics from an independent UK fact-checking charity, Full Fact. That thread has been shared more than 15,000 times. The argument has since rolled on. Hunt on Monday replied with a series of 26 tweets of his own (although losing the chronology in the middle of the thread, making it difficult to follow). “Now I know you are a funny bloke and in politics a lot of insults are traded but the question is can you back up what is a very strong claim?” he asked Little, referring back to his “lying to the public” comment. “To fill the gap [in mental health staffing levels] we now have 8,000 MH nurses in training and have this Sept announced an increase in nurse training places overall by 25%.” Hunt also quoted from a New York Times article from July, which has been corrected three times after the former shadow minister for mental health, Luciana Berger, challenged its contents.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n This is a seductively enjoyable, smart and well-acted film based on the most deadly serious sporting contest of modern times: the Battle of the Sexes tennis match of 1973 in a packed Houston Astrodome. It stars Emma Stone and Steve Carell, respectively women’s No 1 Billie Jean King and fiftysomething ex-champ and self-proclaimed “male chauvinist pig” Bobby Riggs – fighting to prove that men are better at tennis and better, full stop. The film crucially faces the same challenge as the participants from real life: the challenge of tone. How unseriously should this match be taken? How strenuously should the attitude of casual jokiness be maintained? No one involved in this encounter could be certain of its outcome; neither side could be sure of avoiding humiliation, and thus everyone had a vested interest in keeping it light. Up to a point. But only one side was facing jokiness as a weapon, the same weapon of boorish condescension and toxic bantz that they faced outside the sporting arena every day of their lives. The movie displays the same gracious good humour as its heroine. In 1973, King was enraged by the fact that female players on the grand slam circuit were paid a tiny fraction of what the men got, despite pulling in the same number of paying customers.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

He plans to launch a homemade rocket in California as part of a bid to eventually prove that the Earth is flat. Hughes has spent $20,000 (£15,000) building the steam-powered rocket in his spare time, and will be livestreaming the launch over the internet. The self-described daredevil says he switched his focus to rockets after twice breaking his back doing stunt jumps in cars. “I don’t believe in science,” declared the 61-year-old. “I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air. But that’s not science, that’s just a formula.” The rocket, which Hughes aims to reach an altitude of 1,800ft (550 metres) over California, will be launched from the back of a converted motorhome purchased from Craigslist. It is sponsored by a flat Earth research group, and Hughes plans a subsequent trip to try and observe the flatness of the Earth for himself. Speaking about the risks of the flight, Hughes said: “It’s scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive.” Hughes’ website describes him as “the only man to design, build and launch himself in a rocket” – he previously flew in his own rocket in 2014, as this footage shows. Hughes has stated that once he lands at the weekend, he intends to announce that he is running for the governorship of California.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Surging levels of violence at an “unsafe” G4S-run youth jail have put staff in hospital and caused inmates to carry improvised weapons for their safety, inspectors have revealed. The damning inspection report into Oakhill secure training centre, near Milton Keynes, was published on Tuesday as MPs heard that ministers had ordered G4S to set up an external inquiry into abuse allegations at Brook House, the immigration removal centre at Gatwick, which is also run by the private security firm. The joint report by the prison inspectors, with Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission, into Oakhill in September and October – when the centre was near capacity, with 75 boys aged 14 to 17 – finds “no evidence that staff can adequately care and control this volume of young people”. The report rates the youth prison as “inadequate” and says there has been an increase in fights and assaults since the last inspection in January; it records 330 assaults between March and August this year alone, with assaults against staff increasing, including against newly recruited staff, and some so serious they have led to people being taken to hospital. “One manager said that young people are carrying improvised weapons because they do not feel safe. This inhibits some staff from intervening because of the fear of a weapon, and this in turn reinforces the view of young people that staff cannot protect them, thereby continuing the cycle,” the report says. The inspectors say that many of the recommendations from their January inspection have not been met and the centre has deteriorated in most respects, including to do with safety, care, education, resettlement and the “effectiveness of leaders and managers”. They say that unacceptable behaviour, including swearing, intimidation and vandalism, is not being challenged by staff. Oakhill’s newly appointed interim director, Lisette Saunders, said: “We take these findings very seriously.

    "filtered_answer":"<|begin_of_thought|>\nThe task requires generating a story based on the given sentences. The sentences are from a news article about Oakhill secure training centre and Brook House immigration removal centre, both run by G4S, a private security firm.

The prospect of life outside the European Union will alter how we trade, move goods and people around and make our way in the world. For a long time these questions about the future have been neglected by national governments – left to the market, to globalisation, to Brussels. Now we need active change. To provide it, the government is launching its industrial strategy white paper, which will be published next Monday and heavily trailed during this week’s budget. In a welcome move, Theresa May has already outlined how the government plans to increase public and private R&amp;D investment by up to £80bn over the next 10 years. The prime minister also announced £1.7bn to improve transport links within city regions. This comes as the UK is in serious need of new thinking to address fundamental long-term economic challenges: poor productivity, unbalanced regional growth and a weak track record in translating knowledge creation into inclusive wealth creation. The impact of the financial collapse in 2008 and the recent decision to leave the EU have only exacerbated these deep-seated national problems. A long-term industrial strategy for the UK that includes proper investment in R&amp;D and connectivity is overdue.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

For a long time these questions about the future have been neglected by national governments – left to the market, to globalisation, to Brussels. Now we need active change. To provide it, the government is launching its industrial strategy white paper, which will be published next Monday and heavily trailed during this week’s budget. In a welcome move, Theresa May has already outlined how the government plans to increase public and private R&amp;D investment by up to £80bn over the next 10 years. The prime minister also announced £1.7bn to improve transport links within city regions. This comes as the UK is in serious need of new thinking to address fundamental long-term economic challenges: poor productivity, unbalanced regional growth and a weak track record in translating knowledge creation into inclusive wealth creation. The impact of the financial collapse in 2008 and the recent decision to leave the EU have only exacerbated these deep-seated national problems. A long-term industrial strategy for the UK that includes proper investment in R&amp;D and connectivity is overdue.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Stephen Martin, director general of the business group, is to issue the ultimatum to the government at the IoD annual dinner on Tuesday, saying “all we want for Christmas is progress on Brexit”. He will say the time would come soon when the IoD may have to advise all of its members to be ready for no deal and urged the government to stop this outcome. “We know from our recent surveys that over half of you are already in the process of contingency planning,” Martin will say. “The number of businesses who have actually implemented these plans is currently low, around one in 10, but this will snowball if we don’t find out soon what is going to happen in March 2019. “It’s clear that the government has a small window of opportunity between now and the end of the first quarter of next year to secure a firm political agreement on transition. If we don’t have this commitment by the end of March, then business will come under pressure to implement contingency plans, even perhaps as far as relocating operations.” He will say companies supported the idea of a transitional period after March 2019 to help the UK and rest of the EU adjust to Brexit, but they needed to know that cross-border trade would effectively remain unchanged. Martin will say that businesses do not want to move to World Trade Organisation rules as it would be a “huge drop down from where we are now” but may soon have to start planning for that possibility. “WTO is not the simple option, it would involve massive complexity to adjust our customs procedures, and we would lose not just our level of access to the single market, but also potentially all of the trade and investment agreements we have with other countries through the EU,” he will say. “It’s not desirable, but it is possible.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Upon her departure to Australia, the Scottish Labour parliamentary group convened to deliberate on the implications of her absence from the Parliament. However, they decided not to impose immediate punitive measures in reaction to her absence. They stated that Dugdale would be invited to narrate her reasonings on her return from the show, however, they didn't rule out the possibility of some form of sanction.\n\nHer partner, Jenny Gilruth, a Scottish National Party Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), has come to Dugdale's defense, and elucidated that Dugdale had attempted to coordinate her show schedule to coincide with the end of her term as labor leader, but was sabotaged by a premature leak of this information. The leak was published before the Labor Party had officially acknowledged her successor, Richard Leonard's win. Gilruth went as far as to express Dugdale's indignation at the attacks on her judgment and the impact of the leak on the party. \n\nHowever, Dugdale's situation might not be as resolved as it seems. The Scottish Labour Party has stated that there's still the possibility of sanction post-worthy of actions. The entire situation is an interesting example of the evolving political dynamic in Scotland, where tradition and reality TV collide, and where the role of women in politics continues to be scrutinized and contested. \n\nDugdale, an influential figure in Scottish politics, has put herself in a precarious situation. Though, her political career is not over, the incident does highlight the challenges that come with juggling public exposure and political responsibilities. The ultimate impact of this decision on her political prospects remains uncertain, making it an intriguing situation to watch in the unfolding dynamics of Scottish politics. \n\nThis unusual development has added a unique edge to the show and has inadvertently pushed the boundaries of political criticism and public scrutiny in Scotland. As the show progresses and Dugdale continues with her stint, her actions and choices will be keenly monitored, offering new perspectives on the relationship between political life and reality TV.

They stated that Dugdale would be invited to narrate her reasonings on her return from the show, however, they didn't rule out the possibility of some form of sanction.\n\nHer partner, Jenny Gilruth, a Scottish National Party Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), has come to Dugdale's defense, and elucidated that Dugdale had attempted to coordinate her show schedule to coincide with the end of her term as labor leader, but was sabotaged by a premature leak of this information. The leak was published before the Labor Party had officially acknowledged her successor, Richard Leonard's win. Gilruth went as far as to express Dugdale's indignation at the attacks on her judgment and the impact of the leak on the party. \n\nHowever, Dugdale's situation might not be as resolved as it seems. The Scottish Labour Party has stated that there's still the possibility of sanction post-worthy of actions. The entire situation is an interesting example of the evolving political dynamic in Scotland, where tradition and reality TV collide, and where the role of women in politics continues to be scrutinized and contested. \n\nDugdale, an influential figure in Scottish politics, has put herself in a precarious situation. Though, her political career is not over, the incident does highlight the challenges that come with juggling public exposure and political responsibilities. The ultimate impact of this decision on her political prospects remains uncertain, making it an intriguing situation to watch in the unfolding dynamics of Scottish politics. \n\nThis unusual development has added a unique edge to the show and has inadvertently pushed the boundaries of political criticism and public scrutiny in Scotland. As the show progresses and Dugdale continues with her stint, her actions and choices will be keenly monitored, offering new perspectives on the relationship between political life and reality TV. Is there anything else I can help with?\"",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n An appeal against a ban on Silvio Berlusconi holding public office is to be heard by the European court of human rights, in a move that could potentially see Italy’s scandal-tainted former prime minister leading the country again. The hearing on Wednesday, six years after he was forced from office, follows his success at forging a winning coalition out of his centre-right Forza Italia and two far-right parties – the Northern League and Brothers of Italy – in regional elections in Sicily earlier this month. The outcome of the ballot on the southern Italian island was largely seen as a rehearsal for how things might play out in national elections, which must be held before May next year. It also marked the beginning of an authentic political comeback for the 81-year-old, despite being plagued by a tax fraud conviction, sex scandals and allegations of corruption. Considering the length of time it takes for the court to deliver a verdict, it is unlikely to come before the general elections. The current five-year term for the Italian government officially expires on 15 March, although the vote could be held as late as May. “I hope that the Strasbourg court will accept my appeal,” Berlusconi wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “But my role in the next electoral campaign is clear regardless: I will be in the field looking to take the centre-right into government.” The billionaire, who was forced to resign from his third term as prime minister in 2011 over claims he paid for sex with an underage sex worker, has hired top lawyers from London’s Doughty Street Chambers to fight his case. He was ejected from parliament and banned from running for office for six years in 2013 due to his tax fraud conviction. “We’ll have just 30 minutes to set out our argument, the same goes for the government,” Andrea Saccucci, one of the lawyers who will represent Berlusconi in the Strasbourg court, told the Guardian.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Poland has been given two weeks to stop illegal deforestation in the Unesco-protected Białowieża forest or face fines of at least €100,000 a day. In a precedent-setting ruling that will echo across the EU, the European court of justice ordered Poland to show it was acting lawfully in the ancient woodland, or face a €36.5m (£32m) annual penalty. Agata Szafraniuk, a lawyer for the green law firm ClientEarth, said that the court was acting after Poland’s environment minister, Jan Szyszko, showed “complete contempt” for an earlier emergency ban on logging in the ancient woodland. “Financial penalties are, unfortunately, an essential tool to ensure that the best-preserved primeval forest in Europe is protected from further harm,” she said. “Trees are still being cut down every day, so the court prescribed this measure to guarantee the full protection of this unique forest, and to avoid irreparable damage.” The court move will ratchet up pressure on Poland, which is already facing a suspension of its EU Council voting rights over a clampdown on the country’s independent press and judiciary. Women’s groups have also been targeted for police raids, and rights to protest have been curtailed, adding to concerns about the rule of law in the east European country. Donald Tusk, the EU Council president, condemned Poland’s nationalist-right Law and Justice party government on Sunday, suggesting it was following the “Kremlin’s plan”. The Polish government maintains that it always behaves lawfully and that logging in Białowieża is necessary to staunch a spruce bark beetle outbreak. “In the western media, everything is based on disinformation,” a Polish government spokesman told the Guardian. “We are doing everything right by law.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Despite environmental concerns, Poland continues to cut down trees in an effort to combat a bark beetle infestation. However, their actions are considered illegal by the EU, which has threatened substantial financial penalties if Poland fails to stop logging. Environmental lawyers and activists are working to protect the forest, urging Poland to cease their actions.

But when the Huddersfield contemporary music festival began, in 1978, the situation was much worse, with no annual showcase here for what living composers were producing. That such an event took root in an unprepossessing West Yorkshire industrial town in the late 70s was remarkable in itself, especially when most of the activity in new music then was centred on London. What began on a modest scale under the aegis of Huddersfield Polytechnic (now the University of Huddersfield) – where the festival’s tireless founding director, Richard Steinitz, was a lecturer in music – grew quickly into one of the most important dates in the British musical calendar. The HCMF really hit its stride in the early 80s, hosting a series of important premieres alongside residencies from many of the senior figures of postwar music, from Olivier Messiaen and Terry Riley to Hans Werner Henze and Elliott Carter.

Steinitz stood down as director after the 2000 festival. The current director, Graham McKenzie, has been there for more than a decade, not only steering the programming towards new generations of composers from across Europe, but also broadening the stylistic scope, including events that touch on jazz, electronica and rock.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had provisionally found that Concordia had “abused its dominant position to overcharge the NHS” by hiking the price of liothyronine, used to treat patients with an underactive thyroid, by nearly 6,000% between 2007 and 2017. The regulator said the NHS had spent more than £34m on the drug last year, up from about £600,000 in 2006. The amount it paid per pack rose from £4.46 in 2007 to £258.19 by July 2017. The price of a single pill went up from 16p to £9.22, even though production costs remained broadly stable during that period, the CMA said. Concordia could be fined up to 10% of its worldwide annual turnover. Liothyronine tablets are used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition caused by a deficiency of the thyroid hormone that affects at least two in 100 people and can lead to depression, tiredness and weight gain. For many patients there is no alternative and, until this year, Concordia was the only supplier. This summer, the UK firm Morningside Healthcare and Israel’s Teva were granted licences to supply the drug.

    "response":"\"Concordia International, a Canadian pharmaceutical company, has been accused of overcharging the UK's National Health Service (NHS) for an essential thyroid treatment, raking in an extra £100m over a decade. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Britain's main consumer watchdog, has issued a formal complaint against the firm, alleging it abused its dominant position in the UK market to artificially inflate the cost of liothyronine pills by almost 6,000 per cent. This detrimental move has left the NHS paying hundreds of thousands of extra pounds to treat patients with hypothyroidism, a condition that impacts millions of people across the country.\n\n\nStrategy formulated by the CMA is aimed at curbing the profitable but unfair monopoly tactics deployed by Concordia International. Up until recently, Concordia had a complete stranglehold on the supply of liothyronine to the British market. This July, however, the UK's Morningside Healthcare and Israel's Teva have been granted the green light to start selling the drug as well. The move is seen as the first major step towards breaking up Concordia's monopoly and lowering the cost of treatment across the board for hypothyroidism patients.\n\n\nThe CMA complaint is only provisional, but it could on its conclusion result in a fine of up to 10 per cent of Concordia International's global annual turnover, sending a strong message to big pharmaceutical companies about leveraging their market power in a detrimental manner. While Concordia contests the allegations, the increase in the price of the drug, liothyronine, from 16p to £9.22 per pill raises serious questions about the company’s business model and ethics. Despite the enduring increase in costs, the production expenses reportedly remained constant.\n\n\nFurthermore, for countless patients across the UK, who suffer from hypothyroidism, the treatment is indispensable as it helps them manage symptoms like tiredness, weight gain, and depression. Proponents of the new regulation hope these changes point towards a possible rebalancing of the stakeholders constituting both the health sector and its users. With Morningside Healthcare and Teva now part of the supply chain, the cost of liothyronine might finally stabilize, ensuring that patients continue to receive the crucial treatment without bearing a disproportionate financial burden.\"",

This detrimental move has left the NHS paying hundreds of thousands of extra pounds to treat patients with hypothyroidism, a condition that impacts millions of people across the country.\n\n\nStrategy formulated by the CMA is aimed at curbing the profitable but unfair monopoly tactics deployed by Concordia International. Up until recently, Concordia had a complete stranglehold on the supply of liothyronine to the British market. This July, however, the UK's Morningside Healthcare and Israel's Teva have been granted the green light to start selling the drug as well. The move is seen as the first major step towards breaking up Concordia's monopoly and lowering the cost of treatment across the board for hypothyroidism patients.\n\n\nThe CMA complaint is only provisional, but it could on its conclusion result in a fine of up to 10 per cent of Concordia International's global annual turnover, sending a strong message to big pharmaceutical companies about leveraging their market power in a detrimental manner. While Concordia contests the allegations, the increase in the price of the drug, liothyronine, from 16p to £9.22 per pill raises serious questions about the company’s business model and ethics. Despite the enduring increase in costs, the production expenses reportedly remained constant.\n\n\nFurthermore, for countless patients across the UK, who suffer from hypothyroidism, the treatment is indispensable as it helps them manage symptoms like tiredness, weight gain, and depression. Proponents of the new regulation hope these changes point towards a possible rebalancing of the stakeholders constituting both the health sector and its users. With Morningside Healthcare and Teva now part of the supply chain, the cost of liothyronine might finally stabilize, ensuring that patients continue to receive the crucial treatment without bearing a disproportionate financial burden.\"",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Turnbull government has deployed new modelling on the national energy guarantee in an effort to step up pressure on state governments to sign up to its policy at a meeting of energy ministers on Friday. A summary of the modelling, circulated by the government in advance of the talks with the states, suggests household power bills between 2020 and 2030 would be “in the order of” $120 a year lower, in today’s dollars, than under a business-as-usual scenario, if the policy applied across the national electricity market. The material supplied by the government says wholesale electricity prices would be 23% lower than business-as-usual between 2020 and 2030, and it suggests the share of renewables in the market by 2030 “could range from 32% to 36%”. The full modelling, undertaken for the Energy Security Board by Frontier Economics, has not yet been distributed to state energy ministers and the documents circulated in Canberra are a summary of the findings, not the work itself. The Turnbull government announced in October it would dump the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and proceed with the national energy guarantee – a policy that imposes new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020. The policy requires cooperation from the states but some of the Labor governments, particularly South Australia, have been hostile. Part of the reason for that is the states were involved in the exhaustive consultations with Finkel about the clean energy target but were not kept in the loop about the national energy guarantee. Some state governments are also concerned the Turnbull policy will hard-bake coal into the system at the expense of renewables at a time when the energy market needs to transition to low-emissions power sources. A spokesman for the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, is continuing to insist that the state will not commit to sign on to the national energy guarantee in the absence of data showing its specific impact on the state. The Labor states have also commissioned their own work through the Council of Australian Governments energy council examining whether or not they could implement a clean energy target by themselves.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Czech tennis player Jana Novotná, who has died of cancer aged 49, had a career of consistent success that would have more than satisfied most players, but fell some way short of what she would have achieved had she possessed a much steadier nerve. In 1998, the year before she retired, Novotná became only the fifth female player to pass the $10m mark in career prize money and in the same year was within reach of being ranked No 1 in the world. As an athlete she was among the best of her era, possessed of consummate skill in the dying and difficult art of serve-and-volley and an ability to deliver a backhand smash that was the envy of her peers. And yet in her 14 years at the top of the women’s game she won only 24 tour singles titles. Even more disappointingly, she reached the last eight in 22 of the 50 grand slam singles events in which she competed but managed to convert that consistency into just one title. The American player and commentator Pam Shriver, who was a good friend, explained this by saying that Novotná was “as kind as she was athletic”. Others, mostly tennis writers such as myself, put it more brutally: she was a choker. Novotná herself said she hated the idea of choking, preferring instead to say that she “got a little tight”. Her most famous episode of getting a little tight is now a case study for sports psychologists. It came in the 1993 Wimbledon final when she led Steffi Graf 6-7, 6-1, 4-1, and at 40-30 in the sixth game of the deciding set had a service point for a 5-1 lead over the German.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Czech tennis player Jana Novotná, who has died of cancer aged 49, had a career of consistent success that would have more than satisfied most players, but fell some way short of what she would have achieved had she possessed a much steadier nerve. In 1998, the year before she retired, Novotná became only the fifth female player to pass the $10m mark in career prize money and in the same year was within reach of being ranked No 1 in the world. As an athlete she was among the best of her era, possessed of consummate skill in the dying and difficult art of serve-and-volley and an ability to deliver a backhand smash that was the envy of her peers. And yet in her 14 years at the top of the women’s game she won only 24 tour singles titles. Even more disappointingly, she reached the last eight in 22 of the 50 grand slam singles events in which she competed but managed to convert that consistency into just one title. The American player and commentator Pam Shriver, who was a good friend, explained this by saying that Novotná was “as kind as she was athletic”. Others, mostly tennis writers such as myself, put it more brutally: she was a choker. Novotná herself said she hated the idea of choking, preferring instead to say that she “got a little tight”. Her most famous episode of getting a little tight is now a case study for sports psychologists. It came in the 1993 Wimbledon final when she led Steffi Graf 6-7, 6-1, 4-1, and at 40-30 in the sixth game of the deciding set had a service point for a 5-1 lead over the German.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The Czech athlete's prowess lay in her unmatched backhand smash and impeccable serve-and-volley style.\nSECTION 2\nDuring her 14-year career, Novotná reached the semi-finals in 22 Grand Slam singles events, simultaneously experiencing the sweet taste of victory and the bitter sting of defeat. One such moment that left an indelible mark on audiences was the 1993 Wimbledon final. Novotná, leading 6-7, 6-1, and 4-1 in the deciding set with a match point against Steffi Graf, crumbled under the immense pressure, leading her to lose the match.\nSECTION 3\nTrue to her serve-and-volley style, Novotná graced the court with a breath-taking backhand smash that awed spectators and peers alike. Amy, a good friend and superb athlete, found inspiration in Novotná's undertakings.\nSECTION 4\nHer apparent inability to handle pressure and emotions, however, overshadowed her prowess. Critics often accused her of \"choking\", a term that Novotná abhorred. She believed that labeling such a psychological stumbling block with a brutal term was not only unhelpful but also counterproductive. For her, the cause was not choking but simply \"getting a little tight\".\nSECTION 5\nUltimately, Novotná's life and career remain a testament to the physical, mental, and emotional struggles faced by athletes. She withstood rigorous competition, public scrutiny about her performance, and personal tragedies. Although she may have failed to live up to her peak potential due to stress, her beautiful game inspired fans worldwide and examined the human condition facing the fiercest psychological battles.\n<|end_of_solution|>",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n EasyJet saw its profits fall 17% last year, with more than £100m lost due to the slump in the pound after the Brexit vote. The airline reported a record year for passenger numbers, flying 80.2 million people, almost 10% more than in 2015-16, on ever fuller planes. But while revenues exceeded £5bn in 2016-17, fares dipped to fill seats in what the chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said was “a difficult year for the aviation industry”. McCall said: “Our planned approach of achieving number one or two positions at Europe’s leading airports, friendly and efficient customer service and a continuous focus on sustainable cost control, has put easyJet at a strategic advantage during a period when there have been bankruptcies and some airlines have struggled operationally.” Profits before tax fell from £494m to £408m. Despite paying a lower dollar price for fuel, the continued weakness of sterling brought additional costs of £101m, easyJet said. The airline will also be prompted by Brexit to change its rules to ensure easyJet is majority owned and controlled by EU nationals after 2019. About a third of shares are owned by the easyJet founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who has dual UK-Cypriot nationality, and will be classed as EU-owned. But easyJet will ask at its 2018 AGM for new powers to force UK shareholders to sell up if necessary to allow it to continue operating in Europe. McCall said the move was “a technical, administrative thing” and the airline had “no concerns” about getting enough EU shareholders. Shares rose by more than 5% in early trading, on the back of the airline reporting high levels of forward bookings and better revenue so far in its 2017-18 financial year, which it said was “primarily as a result of some capacity leaving the market”.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

For example, a stick used casually could offer a twist later.\n\\n\\n\nThe keyword 'value' might be applied in a way that emphasizes what the character gains from knowing their microbiome status or any reflection on the importance or worth of certain food choices.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nIn a dimly lit room filled with the sounds of smooth jazz, Emily sat, twirling a stick stirrer in her Manhattan as she skimming through the results of her £125 microbiome analysis. She had been curious about her gut health, much like the others who went down with her. After receiving the 'Village Peasant' news, she mentioned to her friend, Rachel, \"I read that the Indigene type is way more desirable, associated with tribespeople from the Amazon and Africa.\"\n\nRachel nodded. \"It's true, they eat so much better, like bananas and barley.\"\n\nLaughing, Emily sipped her drink, smoke curling from her finished cigarette, the stick lying on the ashtray, a symbol of the past. \"I know, but they say the Village Peasant type has its own value. It seems like my gut bacteria could reduce inflammation, lowering the risk of Crohn's disease. I guess it all comes down to balance\", she pondered.\n\nBehind the chic jazz tunes and the smoky air, Emily found confidence and peace knowing she had the power to balance her health through her diet. From that day onward, her Manhattan was now accompanied by the delightful consumption of Ovaltine, bringing with it, unforeseen harmony and value.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The campaign group that encouraged Paperchase to apologise for its marketing activities with the Daily Mail is pushing for John Lewis, the department store chain, to stop advertising with the newspaper as well as with the Sun and Daily Express. John Lewis has become a prime target for Stop Funding Hate on the back of the launch of its Christmas advert and as retailers increase their spending on advertising as the festive season approaches. Stop Funding Hate has produced a mock advert that depicts the star of last year’s John Lewis Christmas advert – Buster the dog – as unhappy because the retailer is buying adverts with the Mail, Sun, and Express. The video has been shared almost 10,000 times on Twitter and Facebook. Sainsbury’s, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose are also being targeted by Stop Funding Hate. The organisation was founded last year and says its aim is to take on “divisive hate campaigns” by the Mail, Sun and Express, and persuade advertisers to cease their financial input. Richard Wilson, the founder of Stop Funding Hate, said: “[John Lewis] are a company well known for their ethical values and one that people have a lot of respect for. Customers are saying there is a clash between what the brand stands for and these newspapers. It would be great if John Lewis made a move, but another company could make a move too.” However, John Lewis said it would continue advertising with the newspapers and not bow to the pressure. A spokesperson said: “Withdrawing advertising on the basis of editorial coverage would be inconsistent with our democratic principles, which include freedom of speech and remaining apolitical.” Paperchase announced on Monday that it would not run any marketing campaigns with the Daily Mail and said it was “truly sorry” for running a front-page promotion in Saturday’s edition of the newspaper.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Do not include keywords ['bottle', 'district', 'general', 'stroke', 'tap'] in the response. There should be 3 paragraphs. Paragraphs and only paragraphs are separated with each other by two new lines as if it was '\\n\\n' in python. Paragraph 1 must start with word classic."
