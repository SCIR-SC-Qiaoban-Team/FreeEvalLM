While the effects of boron doping on the electronic band structure of diamond are well-studied, any link between charge carriers and plasmons, which could facilitate optical applications, has never been shown. Here, we report intervalence plasmons in boron-doped diamond, defined as collective electronic excitations between the valence subbands, opened up by the presence of holes. Evidence for these low energy excitations is provided by scanning transmission electron microscope-valence electron energy loss spectroscopy and photoinduced force infrared spectroscopy. The measured loss and absorbance spectra are subsequently reproduced by first-principles calculations based on the contribution of intervalence band transitions to the dielectric function. Remarkably, the calculations also reveal that the real part of the dielectric function exhibits a resonance characteristic of metallicity (narrow-banded negative values of the dielectric function). The energy of the zero-crossing and the position of the loss peak are found to coincide, and both increase with the carrier density.

Here, we report intervalence plasmons in boron-doped diamond, deffined as colelctive electronic excitations betweenhten valence subbands, opened up by the presense of holes. Evidence for theese low energy excitations is provded by scanning transmissionelecton microscope-valenceelecton energy loss spectroscopy andd photoinduced force infrared spectroscopy. The measured loss and absorbance spectra are subsquently reproduced byfirts-principles calculations based on the contribution of intervalence band transitions to the dielectric fucntion.

In this setup, the assembled linear matrix is offloaded onto multiple GPUs using specialized external libraries to solve the linear problem efficiently. These coupled solvers are applied to two industrial test cases representing common scenarios: the NASA CRM in a transonic regime and the external aerodynamics study of the DriveAER car. Significant performance enhancements are evident when compared to other CPU counterparts. Specifically, the NASA CRM case achieves an overall speedup of more than 4x, while the DriveAER test case demonstrates improved stability and reduced computational time compared to segregated solvers.

Our results indicate that the shear-off force of this interface increases with the energetically guided re-attachment rate of adhesive springs, reaching saturation at high re-attachment rates. Remarkably, this shear-off force can surpass the predictions made by this fracture theory. By plotting the adhesive forces along the interface, we observe substantial high adhesive forces distributed throughout the interface, based on which we identify multiple adhesive fronts closely piling up along the interface. These regions can exhibit similar force profiles, and the number appears to increase with the size of this interface, leading to a linear increase in the calculated shear-off force with the size of this interface. We then suggest that multiple adhesive fronts closely pile up to back up each other in adhesive friction due to re-attachments, which may provide profound insights into understanding this observed phenomena associated with adhesive friction along an interface.\n<|end_of_solution|>",

Our analysis is motivated by Landau's analysis of spherically-symmetric shock waves, who predicted that at large times, not just one, but two shocks emerge. These shocks are logarithmically separated from the Minkowskian light cone and fluid velocity decays then non-time-integrable rate \\( \\frac{1}{t(\\log t)^{1\/2}} \\). We show that for initial data, which need not be spherically-symmetric, with two shocks in it and which is sufficiently close, in appropriately weighted Sobolev norms, to an N-wave profile, the solution to the shock-front initial value problem can be continued for all time and does not develop any further singularities. In particular, this is the first proof of global existence for solutions (which are necessarily singular) of a quasilinear wave equation in three space dimensions which does not verify the null condition. The proof requires carefully-constructed multiplier estimates and analysis of the geometry of the shock surfaces.",

    "filtered_answer":"Thought:\n1. The task is to correct the misspellings in the provided text while maintaining its original stylistic decisions and context.\n2. The text appears to be discussing the history of string theory, particularly its relation to S-matrix physics and the shift towards quantum gravity.\n3. Recognize and correct misspellings such as \"eearly\" instead of \"early,\" \"hadronic string theory\" instead of \"hadronic string theory,\" and others.\n4. Maintain sentence structures, punctuation, and capitalization as instructed.\n\nSolution:\nThe early history of string theory is marked by a shift from strong interaction physics to quantum gravity. The first string models and associated theoretical framework were formulated in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the context of the S-matrix program for strong interactions. In the mid-1970s, the models were reinterpreted as a potential theory unifying the four fundamental forces. This paper provides a historical analysis of how string theory was developed out of S-matrix physics, aiming to clarify how modern string theory, as a theory detached from experimental data, grew out of an S-matrix program that was strongly dependent upon observable quantities. Surprisingly, the theoretical practice of physicists already turned away from experiment before string theory was recast as a potential unified quantum gravity theory. With the formulation of dual resonance models (the \"hadronic string theory\"), physicists were able to determine almost all of the models' parameters on the basis of theoretical reasoning.

Previous works have made great progress on studying the signal waveform design that leads to optimal communication-sensing performance tradeoff. In this article, we aim to focus on issues arising from the exploitation of the communication devices for sensing in 6G network. Particularly, we will discuss about how to leverage various nodes available in the cellular network as anchors to perform ubiquitous sensing.

This paper will shed light on the opportunities and challenges brought by UE-assisted sensing and RIS-assisted sensing. Our goal is to devise a novel 6G-oriented sensing architecture where BSs, UEs, and RISs can work together to provide ubiquitous sensing services. \n|<end_of_solution|>",

    "ground_truth":"Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in transforming healthcare by automating tasks such as clinical documentation, information retrieval, and decision support. In this aspect, carefully engineered prompts have emerged as a powerful tool for using LLMs for medical scenarios, e.g., patient clinical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a modified version of the MedQA-USMLE dataset, which is subjective, to mimic real-life clinical scenarios. We explore the Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning based on subjective response generation for the modified MedQA-USMLE dataset with appropriate LM-driven forward reasoning for correct responses to the medical questions. Keeping in mind the importance of response verification in the medical setting, we utilize a reward training mechanism whereby the language model also provides an appropriate verified response for a particular response to a clinical question. In this regard, we also include human-in-the-loop for different evaluation aspects. We develop better in-contrast learning strategies by modifying the 5-shot-codex-CoT-prompt from arXiv:2207.08143 for the subjective MedQA dataset and developing our incremental-reasoning prompt. Our evaluations show that the incremental reasoning prompt performs better than the modified codex prompt in certain scenarios. We also show that greedy decoding with the incremental reasoning method performs better than other strategies, such as prompt chaining and eliminative reasoning.",

Not only are the extensions opaque, but the interface between dynamic languages and C types can introduce impedance. We hypothesise that frequent calls to C extension code introduce significant overhead that is often unnecessarily high. We validate this hypothesis by introducing a simple technique, \"typed methods\", which allow selected C extension functions to have additional metadata attached to them in a backward-compatible way. This additional metadata makes it much easier for a JIT compiler (and, as we show, even an interpreter!) to significantly reduce the call and return overhead. Although we have prototyped typed methods in PyPy, we suspect that the same technique is applicable to a wider variety of language runtimes and that the information can also be consumed by static analysis tooling.",
