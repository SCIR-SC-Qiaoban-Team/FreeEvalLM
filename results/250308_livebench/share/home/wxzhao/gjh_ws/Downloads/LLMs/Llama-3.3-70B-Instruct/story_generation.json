      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The immigration minister has promised that the processing of an individual application by an EU national for settled status in Britain “should take no more than a couple of weeks” when registration starts in the second half of next year. The minister, Brandon Lewis, told the Commons home affairs select committee that an extra 1,200 UK visas and immigration staff were being recruited to process an expected 3.5m applications from EU nationals over two and a half years. He also told MPs on Tuesday that he was optimistic that an agreement could be struck by Christmas on the rights of EU citizens in the UK in the Brexit negotiations. However, he declined to comment on reports that the Brexit inner cabinet had decided on Monday that the European court of justice could continue to play a role in guaranteeing their rights during a two-year transition period. The Home Office minister did confirm that those refused “settled status” and classed as non-EU nationals in Britain illegally could have their bank accounts frozen and face deportation before the hearing of any appeal in British courts. The 3million group, representing EU nationals in Britain, immediately questioned Lewis’s claim that an agreement with the EU on “settled status” was likely before Christmas. “We wonder how. Major stumbling blocks still in place,” they tweeted, noting continued differences over the role of the ECJ, over family reunification rights that could affect thousands, and regarding clarification that they should not face “hostile environment measures”. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, voiced scepticism that an extra 1,200 staff – of whom 700 had already been recruited – would be sufficient when the UK Visas and Immigration agency (UKVI) currently used 6,500 staff to process 3m visa applications a year. There was already a three-month delay in processing EU nationals’ applications for permanent residence documents, she said.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The government's decision to continue reducing public spending as a proportion of GDP has raised concerns about the potential collapse of core public services, leading to social mayhem in the coming years. The lack of innovative ideas and understanding of the current state of public services is particularly evident in the area of housing.\n\nSECTION 2\nThe housing sector is a prime example of the government's failure to make obvious connections between policy and reality. Despite some welcome changes to council powers, the budget fails to address the need for active and financially supported local government to facilitate the development of new housing. This includes building houses, allocating land, and policing the actions of private developers. Some of the key issues with the current approach to housing include:\n* Insufficient funding for local government to support housing development\n* Lack of consideration for public acceptance of new housing schemes\n* Inadequate measures to address the delinquency of private developers\n* Failure to recognize the importance of local government in facilitating housing development\n\nSECTION 3\nThe government's reliance on free market ideology, as exemplified by figures like Oliver Letwin, is seen as a major obstacle to finding effective solutions to the housing crisis. The need for a more nuanced and realistic approach to housing policy is clear, one that takes into account the complexities of local communities and the role of public services in supporting them. Any other questions?",

Some of the key issues with the current approach to housing include:\n* Insufficient funding for local government to support housing development\n* Lack of consideration for public acceptance of new housing schemes\n* Inadequate measures to address the delinquency of private developers\n* Failure to recognize the importance of local government in facilitating housing development\n\nSECTION 3\nThe government's reliance on free market ideology, as exemplified by figures like Oliver Letwin, is seen as a major obstacle to finding effective solutions to the housing crisis. The need for a more nuanced and realistic approach to housing policy is clear, one that takes into account the complexities of local communities and the role of public services in supporting them. Any other questions?",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Philip Hammond must borrow an extra £90bn over the next five years after the Treasury’s independent forecaster downgraded productivity growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that the chancellor faced a long period of lower than expected wages growth that would dent tax receipts and push up borrowing. The cumulative effect over the life of the parliament would add £90.5bn to the UK’s debt pile and jeopardise Hammond’s target of balancing the government’s books by 2025, it said. The Treasury said that once the positive effects of an increase in employment and better than expected borrowing over the last year are taken into account, the net borrowing rise would be £35bn, putting the chancellor in a position to reach his target of creating a surplus in the middle of the next decade. But some analysts said the OBR’s revision failed to go far enough and it continued to overestimate the capacity of British businesses to invest in new equipment and processes to drive up productivity. They argued that the forecaster should have gone further and predicted that productivity growth – which measures the average output per hour worked – of almost zero over the last seven years would continue for another five years. Joanna Davies, a UK economist at Fathom Consulting, said the OBR’s new forecast that productivity would increase at a rate of 1.1% until 2022 – almost half the 2.1% average seen in the 30 years before 2007 – still looked ambitious. She said the prospects for GDP growth would suffer a severe knock-on effect from lower productivity and a rapidly ageing population. “Over the last five years, productivity growth has averaged just 0.3%,” she said. “Combined with UN projections for working-age population growth, the UK’s trend rate of overall economic growth is probably somewhere in the range 0.5%-1% – around half the 1.5% assumed by the OBR.” The OBR chair, Robert Chote, said GDP growth would not only be hit by lower productivity, but also a weaker than expected export sector that would fail to benefit significantly from the lower pound.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n MPs have been forced to deny that a Commons vote last week means animals are not recognised in the UK as sentient life forms. An amendment to the European Union (withdrawal bill to transfer the EU protocol on animal sentience into UK law was defeated by 313 votes to 295 on 15 November, and since then a row has developed as to what the vote meant in practice. Describing some of the reporting on the vote as “weird and dishonest”, Tory MP Zac Goldsmith tweeted a clarification that the vote had been about the correct legal procedure for ensuring animal welfare standards – not on the principle of whether animals are sentient. Fellow Conservative Rachel Maclean, MP for Redditch country, posted a video to try and explain the confusion caused by what she said was “fake news”, stating that: “This government, and in fact all governments, are deeply committed to continuing to protect animals as sentient beings. That law is already written into our own law.” Theresa May said at Wednesday’s PMQs: “We recognise and respect that animals are sentient beings, and should be treated accordingly.” Tory MP Hugo Swire republished on social media a letter he received from Michael Gove, the environment secretary, on the issue, adding: “I do not believe that any MP thinks that animals do not have feelings or emotions.” Nevertheless, the vote has triggered protests from animal rights groups, including multiple online petitions aimed at the House of Lords, UK parliament and Gove. Public figures including the presenter Sue Perkins have voiced strong criticism of MPs over the issue. Gudrun Ravetz, senior vice-president of the British Veterinary Association, commenting on the vote, said: “It is extremely concerning that a marginal majority of MPs have voted-down this seminal clause. This action undermines the government’s previous promises that the UK will continue to be known for our high standards of animal health and welfare post-Brexit.” However, Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley, pointed out that EU law still allowed many practices across Europe that animal rights groups oppose. The amendment, proposed by the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas, among others, had set out to specifically incorporate article 13 of title II of the Lisbon treaty into UK law. During debate on the amendment last Wednesday, Lucas pointed out that the origins of the clause began with the 1997 UK presidency of the EU and that from 1999 EU law had explicitly recognised that animals were sentient life forms.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

An amendment to the European Union (withdrawal bill to transfer the EU protocol on animal sentience into UK law was defeated by 313 votes to 295 on 15 November, and since then a row has developed as to what the vote meant in practice. Describing some of the reporting on the vote as “weird and dishonest”, Tory MP Zac Goldsmith tweeted a clarification that the vote had been about the correct legal procedure for ensuring animal welfare standards – not on the principle of whether animals are sentient. Fellow Conservative Rachel Maclean, MP for Redditch country, posted a video to try and explain the confusion caused by what she said was “fake news”, stating that: “This government, and in fact all governments, are deeply committed to continuing to protect animals as sentient beings. That law is already written into our own law.” Theresa May said at Wednesday’s PMQs: “We recognise and respect that animals are sentient beings, and should be treated accordingly.” Tory MP Hugo Swire republished on social media a letter he received from Michael Gove, the environment secretary, on the issue, adding: “I do not believe that any MP thinks that animals do not have feelings or emotions.” Nevertheless, the vote has triggered protests from animal rights groups, including multiple online petitions aimed at the House of Lords, UK parliament and Gove. Public figures including the presenter Sue Perkins have voiced strong criticism of MPs over the issue. Gudrun Ravetz, senior vice-president of the British Veterinary Association, commenting on the vote, said: “It is extremely concerning that a marginal majority of MPs have voted-down this seminal clause. This action undermines the government’s previous promises that the UK will continue to be known for our high standards of animal health and welfare post-Brexit.” However, Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley, pointed out that EU law still allowed many practices across Europe that animal rights groups oppose. The amendment, proposed by the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas, among others, had set out to specifically incorporate article 13 of title II of the Lisbon treaty into UK law. During debate on the amendment last Wednesday, Lucas pointed out that the origins of the clause began with the 1997 UK presidency of the EU and that from 1999 EU law had explicitly recognised that animals were sentient life forms.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"The seasonal treat-based countdown might these days have expanded into cosmetics and booze, but nothing beats 24 days of chocolate. For many, the highlight of the holiday season is the traditional Advent calendar, where each day leading up to Christmas is marked with a delicious piece of chocolate.

Some companies now offer calendars filled with cosmetics, skincare products, or even booze. While these alternatives may appeal to some, for many, the traditional chocolate calendar remains the gold standard. There's something special about the combination of the daily countdown and the taste of rich, creamy chocolate that just can't be beat.

    "response":"The year was 1640, and Claudio Monteverdi, the renowned maestro di cappella at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, had just released a collection of his most exploratory works. The collection, titled \"moral and spiritual forest,\" was a culmination of his three decades of experience leading the basilica's sumptuous choir and instrumental band. With its 40-piece choir and crack instrumental band, the basilica was the perfect venue for Monteverdi's grand and intricate compositions. The collection featured a wide range of pieces, from grand ensembles to intimate solo confessionals, showcasing Monteverdi's mastery of various musical styles.\n\n*** \nConductor Pablo Heras-Casado had recently recorded Monteverdi's collection with the Balthasar Neumann ensemble, and the result was a mixed bag. While Heras-Casado's tendency to over-shape the bigger pieces and smooth out the rough edges resulted in a polished but sometimes overly refined sound, the individual musicians and singers of the ensemble shone in their more intimate performances. The duos and trios, in particular, were a highlight of the recording, with the musicians displaying a nimbleness and expressiveness that brought Monteverdi's music to life. It was clear that Heras-Casado had assembled a talented group of musicians, but his approach to the music sometimes felt at odds with the raw emotion and spontaneity that Monteverdi's compositions demanded.\n\n*** \nOne of the standout pieces in the recording was the Salve Regina, sung by sopranos Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner. Their piercing delivery and precise harmonies brought a sense of urgency and devotion to the music, and their performance was a testament to the ensemble's technical skill and musicality. In moments like these, the recording felt truly alive, and the listener could sense the emotional depth and complexity of Monteverdi's music. It was a shame, then, that Heras-Casado's approach to the larger pieces sometimes felt more restrained, as if he was holding back the very passion and energy that made Monteverdi's music so compelling.\n\n*** \nDespite these reservations, the recording was still a worthwhile addition to any Monteverdi enthusiast's collection. The Balthasar Neumann ensemble was clearly dedicated to bringing Monteverdi's music to life, and their performances were marked by a sense of commitment and enthusiasm. Heras-Casado's approach may not have been to everyone's taste, but it was clear that he had a deep understanding of the music and a desire to communicate its beauty and complexity to the listener. With its mix of grandeur and intimacy, Monteverdi's \"moral and spiritual forest\" was a collection that rewarded close listening and attention, and this recording was no exception.\n\n*** \nIn the end, the recording of Monteverdi's \"moral and spiritual forest\" was a reminder of the power and beauty of his music. Despite some reservations about Heras-Casado's approach, the individual musicians and singers of the Balthasar Neumann ensemble had risen to the challenge of performing this complex and demanding music. As the listener delved deeper into the collection, they could sense the rough edges and spontaneous moments that made Monteverdi's music so compelling, and the recording became a journey of discovery and exploration. With its intricate harmonies, soaring melodies, and emotional depth, Monteverdi's \"moral and spiritual forest\" was a true masterpiece, and this recording was a worthy tribute to its enduring beauty and power.",

Heras-Casado's approach may not have been to everyone's taste, but it was clear that he had a deep understanding of the music and a desire to communicate its beauty and complexity to the listener. With its mix of grandeur and intimacy, Monteverdi's \"moral and spiritual forest\" was a collection that rewarded close listening and attention, and this recording was no exception.\n\n*** \nIn the end, the recording of Monteverdi's \"moral and spiritual forest\" was a reminder of the power and beauty of his music. Despite some reservations about Heras-Casado's approach, the individual musicians and singers of the Balthasar Neumann ensemble had risen to the challenge of performing this complex and demanding music. As the listener delved deeper into the collection, they could sense the rough edges and spontaneous moments that made Monteverdi's music so compelling, and the recording became a journey of discovery and exploration. With its intricate harmonies, soaring melodies, and emotional depth, Monteverdi's \"moral and spiritual forest\" was a true masterpiece, and this recording was a worthy tribute to its enduring beauty and power.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has promised to donate part of her fee from appearing in I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here to a homeless charity as she defended her decision to appear in the show. Dugdale rejected complaints from her Labour colleagues at Holyrood that taking part in the ITV reality show was akin to taking a second job, but admitted she would be well paid for it. Speaking to show-business reporters in Australia for the first time since her participation provoked a backlash from other Labour MSPs, Dugdale insisted the show would allow her to connect with voters. She said she had set aside three weeks’ salary as an MSP for the Rock Trust homeless charity and not a motor neurone disease campaign as previously thought. Dugdale launched a @TeamKez Twitter feed on Wednesday morning, featuring a short video clip recorded before she left Edinburgh of her wearing a Rock Trust T-shirt, where she addressed her constituents, and by extension her Labour critics. She said in the film: “I appreciate that to quite a few of my constituents, this is quite a controversial move. I know there will be people upset about it, that will question my priorities.” Saying they deserved an explanation, she added: “First and foremost, I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here is a huge UK-wide television programme, with an audience into the millions. “I think it’s an amazing opportunity to talk to young people who watch this programme about politics, and – in particular – Labour values. The Daily Record, which employs her as a columnist, quoted her as saying: “I have a record of giving money to charity. This isn’t a second job, this is three weeks out of my work.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Entire output should be wrapped in JSON format.

Dugdale rejected complaints from her Labour colleagues at Holyrood that taking part in the ITV reality show was akin to taking a second job, but admitted she would be well paid for it. Speaking to show-business reporters in Australia for the first time since her participation provoked a backlash from other Labour MSPs, Dugdale insisted the show would allow her to connect with voters. She said she had set aside three weeks’ salary as an MSP for the Rock Trust homeless charity and not a motor neurone disease campaign as previously thought. Dugdale launched a @TeamKez Twitter feed on Wednesday morning, featuring a short video clip recorded before she left Edinburgh of her wearing a Rock Trust T-shirt, where she addressed her constituents, and by extension her Labour critics. She said in the film: “I appreciate that to quite a few of my constituents, this is quite a controversial move. I know there will be people upset about it, that will question my priorities.” Saying they deserved an explanation, she added: “First and foremost, I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here is a huge UK-wide television programme, with an audience into the millions. “I think it’s an amazing opportunity to talk to young people who watch this programme about politics, and – in particular – Labour values. The Daily Record, which employs her as a columnist, quoted her as saying: “I have a record of giving money to charity.

Revealed by a report by Quartz, Google’s Android system, which handles messaging services to ensure delivery of push notifications, began requesting the unique addresses of mobile phone masts (called Cell ID) at the beginning of 2017. The information was captured by the phone and routinely sent to Google by any modern Android device, even when location services were turned off and the sim card was removed. As a result Google could in theory track the location of the Android device and therefore the user, despite a reasonable expectation of privacy. A Google spokesperson said: “In January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery. “However, we never incorporated Cell ID into our network sync system, so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated it to no longer request Cell ID.” Google requested the Cell ID alongside what is called the mobile country code and mobile network code, which identify the country and mobile phone operator that the smartphone is using. That data is used to ensure the phone stays properly connected to Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging system, which handles the delivery of messages and notifications to the smartphone. A persistent connection is required for the system to work, but instead of staying constantly connected, the phone pings Google’s servers at set intervals. The more pings, the greater the battery drain, so the data collected about the country and mobile networks is used to work out the the minimum number of pings required to stay connected without draining the battery – so called heartbeat analysis. The benefit of having the address of the mobile phone mast to ensure message service reliability is not clear, but through a process of triangulation – the same used to assist when a user is actively using location services – the position of the user can be revealed down to a roughly 400m radius at a minimum, and often much more accurately in urban areas.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"Section 1\nThe movie, a classic French entertainment, tells the story of Fiona, a young woman from Canada who comes to Paris to visit her aunt Marthe, played by the late Emmanuelle Riva. As Fiona navigates the city, she experiences a series of mishaps, including a memorable encounter with a romantic tramp named Dom. Their meeting is sparked by a chance event on the banks of the Seine, which sets the tone for a whimsical and charming story. As Fiona and Dom spend more time together, they find themselves drawn to each other, and their romance blossoms in the city of love.\n\nSection 2\nAs the story unfolds, Fiona and Dom find themselves at a lively party, where they watch a breathtaking tango performance that sets the room ablaze with energy, much like a fire that ignites passion and excitement. The quote from Dom, \"Life is like a tango, you never know what step comes next,\" becomes a recurring theme throughout the movie, reminding the characters to be spontaneous and open to new experiences.

    "filtered_answer":"Section 1\nThe movie, a classic French entertainment, tells the story of Fiona, a young woman from Canada who comes to Paris to visit her aunt Marthe, played by the late Emmanuelle Riva. As Fiona navigates the city, she experiences a series of mishaps, including a memorable encounter with a romantic tramp named Dom. Their meeting is sparked by a chance event on the banks of the Seine, which sets the tone for a whimsical and charming story. As Fiona and Dom spend more time together, they find themselves drawn to each other, and their romance blossoms in the city of love.\n\nSection 2\nAs the story unfolds, Fiona and Dom find themselves at a lively party, where they watch a breathtaking tango performance that sets the room ablaze with energy, much like a fire that ignites passion and excitement. The quote from Dom, \"Life is like a tango, you never know what step comes next,\" becomes a recurring theme throughout the movie, reminding the characters to be spontaneous and open to new experiences.

    "response":"<<The Future of Horse Racing Transparency>>\n\nThe British Horseracing Authority had recently announced a new policy that would require trainers to declare wind operations, or \"wind ops,\" on their horses. This move was seen as a step towards greater openness and transparency in the sport, and many punters were excited to have more information at their disposal. Chris Cook, a well-known racing expert, praised the decision, saying it would help those trying to understand the game.\n\nHowever, not everyone was pleased with the new policy. Some trainers took to social media to express their skepticism, claiming that punters would be disappointed to learn that wind ops didn't always improve a horse's performance. They seemed to think that punters believed having access to this information would give them an unfair advantage, or even guarantee them a win.\n\nCook couldn't help but laugh at this notion. He pointed out that even if wind ops did work every time, the odds would quickly adjust to reflect this, making it impossible to profit from blindly backing horses that had undergone the procedure. It seemed that some trainers had a inflated sense of their own importance, and didn't understand how betting worked.\n\nAs the news of the new policy spread, racing fans began to speculate about what it might mean for the sport. Some wondered if it would lead to more accurate predictions, or if it would simply give trainers an excuse for poor performance. Cook expected that the strike rate for horses after a first-time wind op would not be particularly high, but he was eager to see the data and find out for sure.\n\nOne thing was certain: the new policy would bring a new level of transparency to the sport, and punters would have more information to work with.

Little, best known for his role as Anthony in the sitcom The Royle Family, accused the health secretary in a tweet of “knowingly lying” to the public about statistics and told Hunt to sue him if he was wrong.

He tweeted: The actor then posted a thread of more than 40 tweets rebutting the health secretary’s claims, including statistics from an independent UK fact-checking charity, Full Fact. That thread has been shared more than 15,000 times. The argument has since rolled on. Hunt on Monday replied with a series of 26 tweets of his own (although losing the chronology in the middle of the thread, making it difficult to follow). “Now I know you are a funny bloke and in politics a lot of insults are traded but the question is can you back up what is a very strong claim?” he asked Little, referring back to his “lying to the public” comment. “To fill the gap [in mental health staffing levels] we now have 8,000 MH nurses in training and have this Sept announced an increase in nurse training places overall by 25%.” Hunt also quoted from a New York Times article from July, which has been corrected three times after the former shadow minister for mental health, Luciana Berger, challenged its contents.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

It stars Emma Stone and Steve Carell, respectively women’s No 1 Billie Jean King and fiftysomething ex-champ and self-proclaimed “male chauvinist pig” Bobby Riggs – fighting to prove that men are better at tennis and better, full stop. The film crucially faces the same challenge as the participants from real life: the challenge of tone. How unseriously should this match be taken? How strenuously should the attitude of casual jokiness be maintained? No one involved in this encounter could be certain of its outcome; neither side could be sure of avoiding humiliation, and thus everyone had a vested interest in keeping it light. Up to a point. But only one side was facing jokiness as a weapon, the same weapon of boorish condescension and toxic bantz that they faced outside the sporting arena every day of their lives. The movie displays the same gracious good humour as its heroine. In 1973, King was enraged by the fact that female players on the grand slam circuit were paid a tiny fraction of what the men got, despite pulling in the same number of paying customers.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The film crucially faces the same challenge as the participants from real life: the challenge of tone. How unseriously should this match be taken? How strenuously should the attitude of casual jokiness be maintained? No one involved in this encounter could be certain of its outcome; neither side could be sure of avoiding humiliation, and thus everyone had a vested interest in keeping it light. Up to a point. But only one side was facing jokiness as a weapon, the same weapon of boorish condescension and toxic bantz that they faced outside the sporting arena every day of their lives. The movie displays the same gracious good humour as its heroine. In 1973, King was enraged by the fact that female players on the grand slam circuit were paid a tiny fraction of what the men got, despite pulling in the same number of paying customers.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"As I sat in the theatre, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me. The play, written by Natal'ya Vorozhbit, was a powerful reminder of the war that had ravaged Ukraine, leading to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. I had reported on the conflict at the time, but it had been years since I'd thought about the devastation and loss that the people of Ukraine had suffered. The play was made up of six vignettes, each one a poignant and haunting portrayal of the violence and brutality of war. The first scene was the most striking, as a Kiev-based writer named Natal'ya recounted her own story of falling in love with a patriotic escort during a research trip to the battle zone. Her words were personal and moving, filled with a sense of double guilt - guilt for reveling in the attention of her escort, and guilt for finding love in a place where men were killing each other with rocket launchers. As the play progressed, the scenes became increasingly disturbing, with teenage girls waiting eagerly for soldiers, a female medic transporting the headless corpse of her lover, and a young journalist outwitting her captor. But it was the complexity of the characters, and the nuance of their emotions, that truly drove home the horror of war.\n\n******\n\nNatal'ya sat at her desk, staring blankly at the wall as she tried to process the memories that had come flooding back. She had written about her experiences in the war-torn region of Ukraine, but it wasn't until she saw the play that she truly felt the weight of her emotions. The story of a research trip she had made to the battle zone a year after the siege of Donetsk airport was one she had told before, but this time it felt different. This time, it felt like she was reliving the moment she fell for her patriotic escort, the moment she felt a spark of love in a place where death and destruction seemed to reign supreme. As she watched the play, Natal'ya felt a sense of pride and sadness, knowing that she had been one of the lucky ones, that she had made it out of the war zone with her life and her sanity intact. But she also felt a sense of anger, knowing that the war had left deep scars, scars that would take years to heal. The play was a powerful reminder of the human cost of war, of the women who had been affected by the conflict, and of the complexities of the politics behind the pitched battles. And as Natal'ya left the theatre, she knew that she would never forget the lessons she had learned, lessons about love, loss, and the resilience of the human spirit.",

He plans to launch this rocket in California, with the aim of eventually proving that the Earth is flat, a theory that goes against established scientific knowledge.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Surging levels of violence at an “unsafe” G4S-run youth jail have put staff in hospital and caused inmates to carry improvised weapons for their safety, inspectors have revealed. The damning inspection report into Oakhill secure training centre, near Milton Keynes, was published on Tuesday as MPs heard that ministers had ordered G4S to set up an external inquiry into abuse allegations at Brook House, the immigration removal centre at Gatwick, which is also run by the private security firm. The joint report by the prison inspectors, with Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission, into Oakhill in September and October – when the centre was near capacity, with 75 boys aged 14 to 17 – finds “no evidence that staff can adequately care and control this volume of young people”. The report rates the youth prison as “inadequate” and says there has been an increase in fights and assaults since the last inspection in January; it records 330 assaults between March and August this year alone, with assaults against staff increasing, including against newly recruited staff, and some so serious they have led to people being taken to hospital. “One manager said that young people are carrying improvised weapons because they do not feel safe. This inhibits some staff from intervening because of the fear of a weapon, and this in turn reinforces the view of young people that staff cannot protect them, thereby continuing the cycle,” the report says. The inspectors say that many of the recommendations from their January inspection have not been met and the centre has deteriorated in most respects, including to do with safety, care, education, resettlement and the “effectiveness of leaders and managers”. They say that unacceptable behaviour, including swearing, intimidation and vandalism, is not being challenged by staff. Oakhill’s newly appointed interim director, Lisette Saunders, said: “We take these findings very seriously. In the report Ofsted recognised that senior managers at Oakhill know what is required to bring the centre up to acceptable standards.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The writer, Jay Rayner, had spoken about the significance of eating alone, and how it allowed you to indulge in your own desires, without having to consider anyone else's opinions.

Stephen Martin, director general of the business group, is to issue the ultimatum to the government at the IoD annual dinner on Tuesday, saying “all we want for Christmas is progress on Brexit”. He will say the time would come soon when the IoD may have to advise all of its members to be ready for no deal and urged the government to stop this outcome. “We know from our recent surveys that over half of you are already in the process of contingency planning,” Martin will say. “The number of businesses who have actually implemented these plans is currently low, around one in 10, but this will snowball if we don’t find out soon what is going to happen in March 2019. “It’s clear that the government has a small window of opportunity between now and the end of the first quarter of next year to secure a firm political agreement on transition. If we don’t have this commitment by the end of March, then business will come under pressure to implement contingency plans, even perhaps as far as relocating operations.” He will say companies supported the idea of a transitional period after March 2019 to help the UK and rest of the EU adjust to Brexit, but they needed to know that cross-border trade would effectively remain unchanged. Martin will say that businesses do not want to move to World Trade Organisation rules as it would be a “huge drop down from where we are now” but may soon have to start planning for that possibility. “WTO is not the simple option, it would involve massive complexity to adjust our customs procedures, and we would lose not just our level of access to the single market, but also potentially all of the trade and investment agreements we have with other countries through the EU,” he will say. “It’s not desirable, but it is possible.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"Theresa May is facing a critical deadline to secure a clear Brexit transition agreement by March, or risk a large number of companies activating their contingency plans and potentially moving operations out of the UK. The Institute of Directors (IoD) is set to issue a warning to the government, emphasizing the need for progress on Brexit. Stephen Martin, the director general of the IoD, will deliver this message at the organization's annual dinner, stating that \"all we want for Christmas is progress on Brexit\". This urgent call to action reflects the growing concern among businesses about the uncertainty surrounding the UK's exit from the EU.\n\nSmell the air of uncertainty, and you can sense the frustration among business leaders who are eager to plan for the future. The IoD has conducted recent surveys, which reveal that over half of its members are already engaged in contingency planning, although only about one in 10 have implemented these plans so far. However, this number is expected to increase rapidly if the government fails to provide clarity on the Brexit transition by the end of March. Martin will caution that the lack of a firm political agreement on transition will force companies to activate their contingency plans, potentially leading to the relocation of operations out of the UK.\n\nThe IoD's warning is not merely a speculative threat, but a reflection of the real concerns among businesses about the potential consequences of a no-deal Brexit. Companies are seeking a transitional period after March 2019 to help the UK and the rest of the EU adjust to the new reality, but they need assurances that cross-border trade will remain relatively unchanged. The prospect of reverting to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules is undesirable, as it would involve significant complexity and potential losses, including the erosion of access to the single market and trade agreements with other countries. Martin will emphasize that the WTO option is not a simple or preferred solution, but it may become a necessary evil if the government fails to secure a better deal.\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the Brexit deadline, the pressure is mounting on the government to deliver a clear and workable transition agreement. The IoD's ultimatum serves as a reminder that businesses are not simply passive observers in the Brexit process, but active stakeholders with a significant stake in the outcome. The next few months will be crucial in determining the course of the UK's exit from the EU, and the government must respond to the concerns of businesses to avoid a potentially disastrous outcome. The future of the UK's economy and its relationship with the EU hangs in the balance, and the government must act quickly to provide clarity and certainty to businesses. Any other questions?",

Martin will caution that the lack of a firm political agreement on transition will force companies to activate their contingency plans, potentially leading to the relocation of operations out of the UK.\n\nThe IoD's warning is not merely a speculative threat, but a reflection of the real concerns among businesses about the potential consequences of a no-deal Brexit. Companies are seeking a transitional period after March 2019 to help the UK and the rest of the EU adjust to the new reality, but they need assurances that cross-border trade will remain relatively unchanged. The prospect of reverting to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules is undesirable, as it would involve significant complexity and potential losses, including the erosion of access to the single market and trade agreements with other countries. Martin will emphasize that the WTO option is not a simple or preferred solution, but it may become a necessary evil if the government fails to secure a better deal.\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the Brexit deadline, the pressure is mounting on the government to deliver a clear and workable transition agreement. The IoD's ultimatum serves as a reminder that businesses are not simply passive observers in the Brexit process, but active stakeholders with a significant stake in the outcome. The next few months will be crucial in determining the course of the UK's exit from the EU, and the government must respond to the concerns of businesses to avoid a potentially disastrous outcome. The future of the UK's economy and its relationship with the EU hangs in the balance, and the government must act quickly to provide clarity and certainty to businesses. Any other questions?",

In March he was cheered by his backbenchers after the UK avoided the recession predicted by many analysts following the Brexit vote last year. Employment was climbing and measures of consumer and business confidence, which plummeted after the referendum, had bounced back. But he was soon in deep trouble with his Tory colleagues for planning a one percentage point increase in national insurance on the self-employed and, in a humiliating U-turn, he was forced to ditch the whole idea. The election in June left Hammond further weakened. He needs to push through measures that improve the economy’s productivity to have any chance of meeting his pledge to eliminate the UK’s deficit by the mid-2020s, but is also facing pressing problems in public services, welfare provision and a housing market that has effectively locked a generation of young people out of home ownership. Economy What we know: The UK economy expanded by 1.7% in 2016 but registered just 0.5% growth in the first half of this year. The pace has improved since the summer largely due to improving growth rates in Europe and the US, but the outlook remains weak.

The hearing on Wednesday, six years after he was forced from office, follows his success at forging a winning coalition out of his centre-right Forza Italia and two far-right parties – the Northern League and Brothers of Italy – in regional elections in Sicily earlier this month. The outcome of the ballot on the southern Italian island was largely seen as a rehearsal for how things might play out in national elections, which must be held before May next year. It also marked the beginning of an authentic political comeback for the 81-year-old, despite being plagued by a tax fraud conviction, sex scandals and allegations of corruption. Considering the length of time it takes for the court to deliver a verdict, it is unlikely to come before the general elections. The current five-year term for the Italian government officially expires on 15 March, although the vote could be held as late as May. “I hope that the Strasbourg court will accept my appeal,” Berlusconi wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “But my role in the next electoral campaign is clear regardless: I will be in the field looking to take the centre-right into government.” The billionaire, who was forced to resign from his third term as prime minister in 2011 over claims he paid for sex with an underage sex worker, has hired top lawyers from London’s Doughty Street Chambers to fight his case. He was ejected from parliament and banned from running for office for six years in 2013 due to his tax fraud conviction. “We’ll have just 30 minutes to set out our argument, the same goes for the government,” Andrea Saccucci, one of the lawyers who will represent Berlusconi in the Strasbourg court, told the Guardian.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n ‘My motto is: try everything, life is short,” says John Dwyer, the leader of San Francisco garage rockers Thee Oh Sees. “We are growing at every turn. Every day you get a little older, a little closer to the grave – you should taste it all.” A master of contemporary garage rock, he came into prominence as part of the fruitful San Francisco scene of the early 2000s. Since then Thee Oh Sees have rattled out 21 LPs of bewilderingly consistent quality, under various iterations of their name, and Dwyer has written, recorded and released another 20 albums with other collaborators, encompassing everything from industrial electronics to improvised jazz and death metal. In a recent interview with Marc Maron, Dwyer talked of his love of Scott Walker and, in particular, a scene in the Walker documentary 30th Century Man when a percussionist is recorded punching a side of beef; Dwyer has similarly tried to master new sounds, be it a flute on Thee Oh Sees’ Dog Poison or electronic bagpipes on his most recent Damaged Bug LP. His career is full of examples of how to explore genres on a shoestring, too – there are projects that are just drums and vocals (the Drums) or a hefty death metal record squeezed out of three people (Dig That Body Up, It’s Alive). We asked him where to begin in his vast back catalogue. Coachwhips – Bangers vs Fuckers (Narnack, 2003) Coachwhips rewrote the punk aesthetic for the 21st century. Raw, stripped back to the bones of guitar, drums and keys, their shows were chaotic and rambunctious.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n ‘My motto is: try everything, life is short,” says John Dwyer, the leader of San Francisco garage rockers Thee Oh Sees. “We are growing at every turn. Every day you get a little older, a little closer to the grave – you should taste it all.” A master of contemporary garage rock, he came into prominence as part of the fruitful San Francisco scene of the early 2000s. Since then Thee Oh Sees have rattled out 21 LPs of bewilderingly consistent quality, under various iterations of their name, and Dwyer has written, recorded and released another 20 albums with other collaborators, encompassing everything from industrial electronics to improvised jazz and death metal. In a recent interview with Marc Maron, Dwyer talked of his love of Scott Walker and, in particular, a scene in the Walker documentary 30th Century Man when a percussionist is recorded punching a side of beef; Dwyer has similarly tried to master new sounds, be it a flute on Thee Oh Sees’ Dog Poison or electronic bagpipes on his most recent Damaged Bug LP. His career is full of examples of how to explore genres on a shoestring, too – there are projects that are just drums and vocals (the Drums) or a hefty death metal record squeezed out of three people (Dig That Body Up, It’s Alive). We asked him where to begin in his vast back catalogue. Coachwhips – Bangers vs Fuckers (Narnack, 2003) Coachwhips rewrote the punk aesthetic for the 21st century. Raw, stripped back to the bones of guitar, drums and keys, their shows were chaotic and rambunctious. Bangers vs Fuckers epitomises that, squeezing 11 tracks into 18 minutes, and was notable for Dwyer’s use of a telephone transducer rather than a microphone.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Poland has been given two weeks to stop illegal deforestation in the Unesco-protected Białowieża forest or face fines of at least €100,000 a day. In a precedent-setting ruling that will echo across the EU, the European court of justice ordered Poland to show it was acting lawfully in the ancient woodland, or face a €36.5m (£32m) annual penalty. Agata Szafraniuk, a lawyer for the green law firm ClientEarth, said that the court was acting after Poland’s environment minister, Jan Szyszko, showed “complete contempt” for an earlier emergency ban on logging in the ancient woodland. “Financial penalties are, unfortunately, an essential tool to ensure that the best-preserved primeval forest in Europe is protected from further harm,” she said. “Trees are still being cut down every day, so the court prescribed this measure to guarantee the full protection of this unique forest, and to avoid irreparable damage.” The court move will ratchet up pressure on Poland, which is already facing a suspension of its EU Council voting rights over a clampdown on the country’s independent press and judiciary. Women’s groups have also been targeted for police raids, and rights to protest have been curtailed, adding to concerns about the rule of law in the east European country. Donald Tusk, the EU Council president, condemned Poland’s nationalist-right Law and Justice party government on Sunday, suggesting it was following the “Kremlin’s plan”. The Polish government maintains that it always behaves lawfully and that logging in Białowieża is necessary to staunch a spruce bark beetle outbreak. “In the western media, everything is based on disinformation,” a Polish government spokesman told the Guardian. “We are doing everything right by law.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Today’s best bets, by Chris Cook In among the heady speculation at Jessica Harrington’s yard about what Sizing John might do this season, there was a moment of realism yesterday. It came when the trainer stated her baseline ambition for the horse. “I’d like to get him back to the Gold Cup because the last two Gold Cup winners haven’t even got back. That’s Plan A, to get him there. Whatever happens after that will be a bonus.” Harrington is right about this. Neither Coneygree nor Don Cossack made it back to the Gold Cup the year after winning it. This is part of being a top-class staying chaser, in my view; in most cases, you only get a year at the top. Winning a race like that comes at a cost, which can be that the winner is either unwilling or incapable of a reprise. “My only worry,” Harrington continued, “is maybe the three hard races last year might leave a mark on him. But he’d had a good few hard races the year before and he seemed to come out of it very well.” Sizing John is only seven, rising eight, and he looked a picture yesterday.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Today’s best bets, by Chris Cook In among the heady speculation at Jessica Harrington’s yard about what Sizing John might do this season, there was a moment of realism yesterday. It came when the trainer stated her baseline ambition for the horse. “I’d like to get him back to the Gold Cup because the last two Gold Cup winners haven’t even got back. That’s Plan A, to get him there. Whatever happens after that will be a bonus.” Harrington is right about this. Neither Coneygree nor Don Cossack made it back to the Gold Cup the year after winning it. This is part of being a top-class staying chaser, in my view; in most cases, you only get a year at the top. Winning a race like that comes at a cost, which can be that the winner is either unwilling or incapable of a reprise. “My only worry,” Harrington continued, “is maybe the three hard races last year might leave a mark on him. But he’d had a good few hard races the year before and he seemed to come out of it very well.” Sizing John is only seven, rising eight, and he looked a picture yesterday.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"Section 1\nThe story begins at Jessica Harrington's yard, where the trainer is surrounded by speculation about the upcoming season for her horse, Sizing John. The air is filled with excitement and anticipation as everyone wonders what the new season will bring for the talented horse. However, amidst all the speculation, Harrington brings a dose of realism to the conversation. She states that her baseline ambition for Sizing John is to get him back to the Gold Cup, a feat that has proven to be challenging for previous winners.\n\nSection 2\nHarrington's concern is not unfounded, as the last two Gold Cup winners, Coneygree and Don Cossack, were unable to return to the race the following year. This trend is not unique to these two horses, as many top-class staying chasers have struggled to repeat their success after winning a major race like the Gold Cup. The physical demands of these races can take a significant toll on the horses, leaving them either unwilling or incapable of competing at the same level again. Harrington acknowledges this risk, but remains hopeful that Sizing John will be able to defy the odds.\n\nSection 3\nAs Harrington continues to discuss her plans for Sizing John, she expresses her only worry - that the three hard races the horse ran last year might leave a lasting impact on his performance. However, she also recalls that Sizing John had a similar schedule the previous year and seemed to recover well. This gives her reason to be optimistic about the horse's chances of repeating his success. At just seven years old, rising eight, Sizing John is still relatively young and has the potential to continue competing at a high level.\n\nSection 4\nDespite the challenges that lie ahead, Harrington remains focused on her goal of getting Sizing John back to the Gold Cup. She is well aware that anything can happen once the horse reaches the starting line, but for now, she is taking things one step at a time. With a solid plan in place and a talented horse by her side, Harrington is ready to face whatever the new season may bring. As the excitement builds and the speculation continues, one thing is certain - Sizing John will be a horse to watch in the upcoming season. Is there anything else I can help with?",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Concordia International, the Canadian drug company, has overcharged the NHS by more than £100m in the past decade for a life-changing thyroid drug, according to Britain’s competition watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had provisionally found that Concordia had “abused its dominant position to overcharge the NHS” by hiking the price of liothyronine, used to treat patients with an underactive thyroid, by nearly 6,000% between 2007 and 2017. The regulator said the NHS had spent more than £34m on the drug last year, up from about £600,000 in 2006. The amount it paid per pack rose from £4.46 in 2007 to £258.19 by July 2017. The price of a single pill went up from 16p to £9.22, even though production costs remained broadly stable during that period, the CMA said. Concordia could be fined up to 10% of its worldwide annual turnover. Liothyronine tablets are used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition caused by a deficiency of the thyroid hormone that affects at least two in 100 people and can lead to depression, tiredness and weight gain. For many patients there is no alternative and, until this year, Concordia was the only supplier. This summer, the UK firm Morningside Healthcare and Israel’s Teva were granted licences to supply the drug. The medicine, a synthetic version of the hormone T3, is taken by patients who do not respond well to the cheaper alternative, levothyroxine.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Turnbull government has deployed new modelling on the national energy guarantee in an effort to step up pressure on state governments to sign up to its policy at a meeting of energy ministers on Friday. A summary of the modelling, circulated by the government in advance of the talks with the states, suggests household power bills between 2020 and 2030 would be “in the order of” $120 a year lower, in today’s dollars, than under a business-as-usual scenario, if the policy applied across the national electricity market. The material supplied by the government says wholesale electricity prices would be 23% lower than business-as-usual between 2020 and 2030, and it suggests the share of renewables in the market by 2030 “could range from 32% to 36%”. The full modelling, undertaken for the Energy Security Board by Frontier Economics, has not yet been distributed to state energy ministers and the documents circulated in Canberra are a summary of the findings, not the work itself. The Turnbull government announced in October it would dump the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and proceed with the national energy guarantee – a policy that imposes new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020. The policy requires cooperation from the states but some of the Labor governments, particularly South Australia, have been hostile. Part of the reason for that is the states were involved in the exhaustive consultations with Finkel about the clean energy target but were not kept in the loop about the national energy guarantee. Some state governments are also concerned the Turnbull policy will hard-bake coal into the system at the expense of renewables at a time when the energy market needs to transition to low-emissions power sources. A spokesman for the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, is continuing to insist that the state will not commit to sign on to the national energy guarantee in the absence of data showing its specific impact on the state.

    "response":"\"Dale Scott Walkinshaw, a 23-year-old man, had a fateful encounter with the law on 16 September last year. It started when two officers, on their way to investigate a noise complaint in Darwin, stumbled upon a serious crash on the corner of the Stuart Highway and Bargot Road. A Toyota Hilux had smashed into a palm tree, and Walkinshaw, who was behind the wheel, was found hiding behind some vegetation, holding his passenger in his arms. The young woman, whom he had met earlier at a bar, was in and out of consciousness due to a back injury sustained in the crash. Walkinshaw, however, was unharmed but highly intoxicated, with a blood alcohol reading of 0.149. The incident led to his arrest, and he was taken into police custody. Tragically, this was not the end of the story for Walkinshaw, as he would later become a victim of a flawed system. Despite his vulnerable state, Walkinshaw was placed in a caged police vehicle, which lacked the basic safety measure of CCTV cameras. This was not an isolated incident, as a coroner's report would later reveal that Northern Territory police had failed to act on multiple instances of self-harm and suicide attempts in similar vehicles over the years. In fact, between 2013 and the time of Walkinshaw's death, there were at least 16 attempted suicides in caged vehicles, with six cases going undetected until the individuals were semi-conscious or unconscious. The coroner, Greg Cavanagh, heavily criticized the police for ignoring an internal report recommending the installation of CCTV cameras in these vehicles, following an earlier death in custody. Cavanagh's findings were stark, stating that it was not a matter of if a person would die in the back of a police van, but when.

    "filtered_answer":"\"Dale Scott Walkinshaw, a 23-year-old man, had a fateful encounter with the law on 16 September last year. It started when two officers, on their way to investigate a noise complaint in Darwin, stumbled upon a serious crash on the corner of the Stuart Highway and Bargot Road. A Toyota Hilux had smashed into a palm tree, and Walkinshaw, who was behind the wheel, was found hiding behind some vegetation, holding his passenger in his arms. The young woman, whom he had met earlier at a bar, was in and out of consciousness due to a back injury sustained in the crash. Walkinshaw, however, was unharmed but highly intoxicated, with a blood alcohol reading of 0.149. The incident led to his arrest, and he was taken into police custody. Tragically, this was not the end of the story for Walkinshaw, as he would later become a victim of a flawed system. Despite his vulnerable state, Walkinshaw was placed in a caged police vehicle, which lacked the basic safety measure of CCTV cameras. This was not an isolated incident, as a coroner's report would later reveal that Northern Territory police had failed to act on multiple instances of self-harm and suicide attempts in similar vehicles over the years.

Even more disappointingly, she reached the last eight in 22 of the 50 grand slam singles events in which she competed but managed to convert that consistency into just one title. The American player and commentator Pam Shriver, who was a good friend, explained this by saying that Novotná was “as kind as she was athletic”.

With a career spanning 14 years, she had achieved consistent success, earning her a place among the best players of her era. Her impressive skills on the court, particularly in the dying art of serve-and-volley, and her powerful backhand smash, made her a force to be reckoned with. However, despite her impressive abilities, Novotná's career was marked by a lingering sense of unfulfilled potential. She had come close to being ranked No 1 in the world, but somehow, she couldn't quite seem to reach the top.\n\nSECTION 2\nIn 1998, the year before her retirement, Novotná achieved a notable milestone, becoming only the fifth female player to pass the $10m mark in career prize money. This was a testament to her hard work and dedication to the sport. However, her overall record was not without its disappointments. Despite reaching the last eight in 22 of the 50 grand slam singles events she competed in, Novotná managed to convert that consistency into just one title. This disparity between her potential and actual achievements led many to wonder what had held her back. For some, the answer lay in her mental approach to the game.\n\nSECTION 3\nPam Shriver, a fellow player and commentator, offered a nuanced insight into Novotná's personality, describing her as \"as kind as she was athletic.\" This kindness, while an admirable trait, may have contributed to Novotná's inability to close out matches when it mattered most. Others, including tennis writers, were more blunt in their assessment, labeling her a \"choker.\" Novotná herself preferred to downplay this notion, saying she simply \"got a little tight\" in high-pressure situations. This self-awareness, however, did not seem to help her overcome her struggles with nerves.\n\nSECTION 4\nOne episode that has become synonymous with Novotná's struggles is the 1993 Wimbledon final against Steffi Graf. With a commanding lead of 6-7, 6-1, 4-1, and a service point for a 5-1 lead, Novotná seemed poised to take the title. However, she failed to capitalize on this opportunity, ultimately losing the match. This moment has been etched in the memories of tennis fans and has become a case study for sports psychologists. It highlights the complexities of the human psyche and the fragility of even the most skilled athletes under pressure.\n\nSECTION 5\nIn the end, Novotná's legacy is a complex one, marked by both impressive achievements and frustrating disappointments. Her story serves as a reminder that success in sports is not solely determined by physical ability, but also by mental toughness and resilience. Despite her struggles with nerves, Novotná remains an important figure in the history of women's tennis, and her contributions to the sport will not be forgotten.

The airline reported a record year for passenger numbers, flying 80.2 million people, almost 10% more than in 2015-16, on ever fuller planes. But while revenues exceeded £5bn in 2016-17, fares dipped to fill seats in what the chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said was “a difficult year for the aviation industry”. McCall said: “Our planned approach of achieving number one or two positions at Europe’s leading airports, friendly and efficient customer service and a continuous focus on sustainable cost control, has put easyJet at a strategic advantage during a period when there have been bankruptcies and some airlines have struggled operationally.” Profits before tax fell from £494m to £408m.

The airline will also be prompted by Brexit to change its rules to ensure easyJet is majority owned and controlled by EU nationals after 2019. About a third of shares are owned by the easyJet founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who has dual UK-Cypriot nationality, and will be classed as EU-owned. But easyJet will ask at its 2018 AGM for new powers to force UK shareholders to sell up if necessary to allow it to continue operating in Europe. McCall said the move was “a technical, administrative thing” and the airline had “no concerns” about getting enough EU shareholders.

As the airline reported a record year for passenger numbers, with 80.2 million people flying with them, it was clear that the slump in the pound had taken its toll. The additional costs of £101m due to the weakness of sterling were a significant blow, but the airline's chief executive, Carolyn McCall, remained optimistic about the company's future. She likened the challenges faced by the industry to fishing in treacherous waters, where only the most skilled and adaptable could survive.\n\nSection 2\nThe EasyJet story is a reflection of the wider society, where businesses are forced to navigate uncharted territory in the wake of Brexit. The airline's decision to change its rules to ensure majority ownership and control by EU nationals after 2019 is a pragmatic response to the new reality. As the company prepares to ask its shareholders for new powers to force UK investors to sell up if necessary, it's clear that the road ahead will be fraught with challenges. However, McCall remains confident that EasyJet will emerge stronger, much like a tower that stands tall despite the turbulence around it. The airline's focus on sustainable cost control and customer service will be key to its success, as it seeks to treat its passengers to a seamless and efficient travel experience.\n\nSection 3\nDespite the uncertainties surrounding Brexit, EasyJet's forward bookings and revenue for the 2017-18 financial year are looking promising, with shares rising by over 5% in early trading. As the airline continues to defy the odds and push forward with its growth strategy, it's clear that the EasyJet team is committed to providing a top-notch service to its customers. McCall's leadership has been instrumental in steering the company through these turbulent times, and her vision for the future is one of optimism and growth. As EasyJet looks to the horizon, it's clear that the airline is ready to take on the challenges of the post-Brexit world, and to emerge as a leader in the European aviation industry, where it will continue to treat its passengers to a world-class travel experience.",

However, McCall remains confident that EasyJet will emerge stronger, much like a tower that stands tall despite the turbulence around it. The airline's focus on sustainable cost control and customer service will be key to its success, as it seeks to treat its passengers to a seamless and efficient travel experience.\n\nSection 3\nDespite the uncertainties surrounding Brexit, EasyJet's forward bookings and revenue for the 2017-18 financial year are looking promising, with shares rising by over 5% in early trading. As the airline continues to defy the odds and push forward with its growth strategy, it's clear that the EasyJet team is committed to providing a top-notch service to its customers. McCall's leadership has been instrumental in steering the company through these turbulent times, and her vision for the future is one of optimism and growth. As EasyJet looks to the horizon, it's clear that the airline is ready to take on the challenges of the post-Brexit world, and to emerge as a leader in the European aviation industry, where it will continue to treat its passengers to a world-class travel experience.",

    "response":"As I sat at my kitchen table, sipping my Ovaltine, I couldn't help but think about my recent microbiome test results, which categorised me as a Village Peasant. The mention of this term in the test report made me curious, and I began to research more about it. According to Atlas, the company that conducted the test, the Village Peasant microbiome is characterised by a balanced mix of bacteria, including Dorea and eubacterium, which can help reduce inflammation in the gut. I felt a sense of pride knowing that my diet, although not perfect, had some value in maintaining a healthy gut environment. The sound of music drifting from the living room, where my family was gathered, was a pleasant distraction from my thoughts. However, the smell of smoke from the BBQ outside suddenly wafted in, making me feel a bit uneasy. I got up to open the window, and as I did, I noticed a stick lying on the floor, which my child must have left behind. As I picked it up, I thought about how small changes in our daily habits, like eating a balanced diet or spending time outdoors, can have a significant impact on our overall health. The test results had given me a new perspective on the importance of my gut health, and I was determined to make the most of it. With a renewed sense of purpose, I joined my family in the living room, feeling grateful for the simple things in life, like good health, family, and music. The value of a healthy microbiome was something I would not take for granted anymore.",
