      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Half-submerged by a jungle and populated by cows, chickens and goats, it is one of the more unusual tourist attractions on the South Pacific island of Rarotonga: the “cursed” Sheraton hotel complex, a long-abandoned luxury resort that has lain derelict for a quarter of a century. The crumbling, graffiti-covered buildings are overgrown with creepers. The only human visitors to the 70-acre site in Vaimaanga pay a small fee to explore what has become known as the biggest white elephant in the South Pacific. The Italian-backed hotel project, which began in the late 1980s, was designed to revolutionise tourism in the remote Cook Islands by providing the tiny nation with its first five-star resort. But the house of cards collapsed at the 11th hour, with the project 80% complete, amid allegations of mafia involvement and money laundering back in Italy. The Cook Islands government was left with a debt of $120m and was almost bankrupted. In the years since, repeated attempts to finish the project have foundered, but now a new effort to salvage the buildings is under way, and could have an even bigger impact on the tiny Pacific state than the original plans were expected to. Tim Tepaki, a Cook Islander who has been involved in property development in New Zealand, claims to have hundreds of millions of dollars in Chinese backing. He hopes to rebuild the complex and turn the Pacific backwater into a favourite destination for tourists from China. Until now tourism in the Cooks – a nation of 15 islands scattered across an area the size of India – has relied mainly on visitors from Australia and New Zealand, who tend to focus on the capital Rarotonga and the atoll of Aitutaki, a 50-minute flight north.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Pauline Hanson has likened the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, to a “spoilt brat” for ruling out a deal with One Nation. Arriving in Bundaberg just as the Labor campaign left, Hanson, who remains the most visible One Nation asset in Queensland, despite not running in Saturday’s state election, lashed out at Palaszczuk’s continued criticism of the party. Palaszczuk’s insistence that Labor would rather go into opposition than form government with One Nation has become its strongest attack line against the Liberal National party, which is directly preferencing One Nation in 50 of the 61 seats it is running in, as well as admitting, indirectly, it would form government with One Nation, if necessary. The opposition leader, Tim Nicholls, who has previously said he would work with the parliament Queenslanders delivered, was unable to answer “yes or no” to the question of whether he would form government with One Nation on Tuesday during a radio quiz, instead opting for “pass”. Hanson has responded with the line that the major parties are choosing not to respect the will of the people, in the same way Donald Trump’s campaign used Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment against the Democrat campaign last year. “I don’t think the premier knows what she is doing actually, I think she is in such a turmoil over this and she is actually needs to get out of the sandpit and be the leader for this state,” Hanson said. “Because the way she is carrying on, it is not leadership, it is not quality. “To say you won’t work with One Nation, it is just ridiculous. It’s like a spoilt brat, she is carrying on like a spoilt kid, and if that is what leadership means then I think she is heading down the wrong path and Tim Nicholls, he needs to grow up and make a decision, because people want clear decision in this state.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Disney Animation head John Lasseter will take a six-month leave of absence after confessing to unspecified “missteps”. In a company memo, obtained by the Hollywood Reporter, Lasseter writes that he has fallen short in creating a culture that engenders “support and collaboration” and hints at behavior that he has been confronted about. “I’ve recently had a number of difficult conversations that have been very painful for me,” he writes. “It’s never easy to face your missteps, but it’s the only way to learn from them. As a result, I’ve been giving a lot of thought to the leader I am today compared to the mentor, advocate and champion I want to be. It’s been brought to my attention that I have made some of you feel disrespected or uncomfortable. That was never my intent.” Lasseter, who is one of the founders of Pixar and the director of Toy Story, also apologizes for letting employees down while adding more details about the conduct that has led to him taking a sabbatical. “I especially want to apologize to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form,” he writes. “No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.” In a statement, a Disney spokesperson responded: “We are committed to maintaining an environment in which all employees are respected and empowered to do their best work. We appreciate John’s candor and sincere apology and fully support his sabbatical.” The memo has arrived at the same time as an investigation by the Hollywood Reporter into complaints about Lasseter’s behavior.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Australia’s race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, says the high no vote in western Sydney in last week’s historic same-sex marriage postal survey reflects religious observance rather than ethnicity, and he has warned against an outbreak of crass, cultural stereotyping. Soutphommasane used a speech at the University of Western Sydney to issue a pointed warning against adopting “easy narratives” devoid of evidence about the behaviour or inclinations of particular ethnic groups in Australia. “In a world that many describe as post-truth or post-factual, our social cohesion is not always well served by jumping to conclusions,” he said. “Once-appealing narratives take hold, they can help fuel stereotypes about others – and these can be difficult to shake off. Sometimes this is because they may conveniently help to confirm cultural hierarchies in our society.” Soutphommasane said a narrative has sprung up since the postal survey which centres on ethnic minorities or multicultural communities being intrinsically hostile towards same-sex marriage, and to the LGBTI community at large. He said while some ethnic communities hold to the view that marriage is between a man and a woman, that view is shaped often by religious or cultural traditions. The race commissioner said a more clear-eyed examination of the postal survey data suggests religiosity, or religious observance, was a more significant factor for no voters – a fact well understood by the no campaign, which targeted messages to a range of communities in Sydney’s west. Soutphommasane said if you look at the voting trends outside western Sydney, a more mixed picture emerges – a picture where seats with populations of more than 40% born overseas overwhelmingly voted yes. He pointed out that the most multicultural electorates in New South Wales and Victoria recorded high yes votes – seats like Sydney, Grayndler, Kingsford Smith, Bradfield, Batman, Wills, Gellibrand and Chisholm. “To suggest that an overwhelming majority of multicultural communities voted no – and did so out of some essential cultural hostility against gays and lesbians – is to entertain something that comes close to an unkind stereotype,” the race commissioner said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Australia’s race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, says the high no vote in western Sydney in last week’s historic same-sex marriage postal survey reflects religious observance rather than ethnicity, and he has warned against an outbreak of crass, cultural stereotyping. Soutphommasane used a speech at the University of Western Sydney to issue a pointed warning against adopting “easy narratives” devoid of evidence about the behaviour or inclinations of particular ethnic groups in Australia. “In a world that many describe as post-truth or post-factual, our social cohesion is not always well served by jumping to conclusions,” he said. “Once-appealing narratives take hold, they can help fuel stereotypes about others – and these can be difficult to shake off. Sometimes this is because they may conveniently help to confirm cultural hierarchies in our society.” Soutphommasane said a narrative has sprung up since the postal survey which centres on ethnic minorities or multicultural communities being intrinsically hostile towards same-sex marriage, and to the LGBTI community at large. He said while some ethnic communities hold to the view that marriage is between a man and a woman, that view is shaped often by religious or cultural traditions. The race commissioner said a more clear-eyed examination of the postal survey data suggests religiosity, or religious observance, was a more significant factor for no voters – a fact well understood by the no campaign, which targeted messages to a range of communities in Sydney’s west. Soutphommasane said if you look at the voting trends outside western Sydney, a more mixed picture emerges – a picture where seats with populations of more than 40% born overseas overwhelmingly voted yes. He pointed out that the most multicultural electorates in New South Wales and Victoria recorded high yes votes – seats like Sydney, Grayndler, Kingsford Smith, Bradfield, Batman, Wills, Gellibrand and Chisholm. “To suggest that an overwhelming majority of multicultural communities voted no – and did so out of some essential cultural hostility against gays and lesbians – is to entertain something that comes close to an unkind stereotype,” the race commissioner said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

A case in point was Mugabe’s controversial indigenisation law, which required all foreign companies to be controlled by Zimbabweans and was a particular blow to Chinese interests in its diamond industry. “I imagine there are quite a lot of officials in Beijing who will be happy to see Mugabe go,” Anthony said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Patients are being put at risk because doctors are giving them drugs they do not need and sending them for unnecessary surgery to avoid a complaint being made against them, research has revealed. Medics are so scared of being complained about that they are also giving patients more tests than their symptoms merit and not performing procedures that involve more risk than usual. Four out of five doctors who become the subject of a complaint find the experience so stressful that they start practising more “defensive medicine” than before, according to a survey of 6,144 doctors in Britain about whom a patient, relative or colleague had complained. “This involved ‘hedging’, which includes performing more tests than necessary, over-referral and overprescribing as well as ‘avoidance’, which includes avoiding procedures, not accepting high-risk patients or abandoning procedures early,” according to research by a team led by Prof Tom Bourne of Imperial College London, whose findings have been published in the journal BMJ Open. “These behaviours may have a serious impact on patient care,” they warned. While litigation, complaints and investigations are intended to protect patients from poor care and medical negligence, the “burden and stress associated with these processes are clearly having unintended consequences and it may be argued that when examined as a whole, these structures may be causing more harm to patient care than good,” the study said. “While the regulatory system may protect patients from the misconduct of a relatively small number of doctors, it has a perverse effect on the majority of doctors who become preoccupied by defensive practice,” it added. Doctors who resort to “fear-driven working practices that could compromise patient care” also waste vital resources and their conduct “creates significant costs for the NHS”, the co-authors added. Bourne could not quantify how much NHS spending goes on that, but pointed to a study that found such practices accounted for 10% of Italy’s health budget. The General Medical Council, which regulates Britain’s 250,000 doctors, receives 9,000-10,000 complaints a year.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"SECTION 1\n<<Summary of Doctors' Defensive Medicine Practices>>\nDoctors across Britain are practicing defensive medicine to avoid complaints, leading to unnecessary patient treatments and potential harm. This behavior, triggered by stress from complaints and fear of litigation, includes overprescribing, conducting excessive tests, and avoiding riskier procedures. The majority of doctors, after experiencing a complaint, adopt these defensive practices, potentially compromising patient care and causing significant NHS costs. The Guardian article highlights the unintended consequences of the regulatory system, which protects patients from misconduct but forces well-intentioned doctors to prioritize avoiding complaints over optimal medical practices.\n***\nSECTION 2\n\nDue to the storm of complaints, doctors are green-lighting defensive medicine, leading to unnecessary treatments and potential patient harm. Hospitals struggle to tackle the surge in wasteful practices, adding to the financial burden on the NHS. While the issue simmers, the focus tonight should be on reforming the complaint and litigation system to support both patients and doctors in conveying high-quality care. The findings also suggest that unnecessary medical practices could account for a significant portion of national healthcare budgets, similar to the 10% found in Italy's case. The regulatory system must address the perverse incentives created by the current approach to ensure that doctors can focus on providing the best possible care without fear of complaints.  \n***\nSECTION 3\nThought\n<<Analysising the Information Provided>>\nThe article starts by highlighting that physicians are prescribing unnecessary medication and recommending non-essential surgeries due to the fear of receiving complaints. This is a result of the stress they experience from being the target of a patient, relative, or colleague's complaint. This behavior of defensive medicine, which includes over-testing, over-referral, and overprescribing, has been observed in 4 out of 5 doctors who have faced complaints. The Guardian article discusses the unintended consequences of the current complaint and litigation system, which is meant to protect patients, but in reality, leads to the wasteful use of NHS resources and possibly poorer patient outcomes. The study from BMJ Open, led by Prof Bourne, adds weight to these conclusions and suggests that such wasteful practices contribute significantly to national healthcare costs, as is the case in Italy where it was found to consume 10% of the national health budget.  \n***\nSECTION 4\nSolution\n<<Defensive Medicine and NHS Costs>>\nDoctors in the UK are under immense pressure to avoid complaints which often leads to defensive medicine practices. These behaviors, such as over-testing and prescribing, can lead to unnecessary treatments and potential harm to patients. The stress caused by complaints is prompting doctors to adopt these practices which not only impair patient care but also put a strain on NHS resources. The findings from the BMJ Open study suggest that these unnecessary medical practices could potentially account for a significant portion of the NHS budget, similar to the 10% observed in Italy. This points to a need for a reevaluation of the current complaint and litigation system to better protect both patients and healthcare providers. The regulatory system must ensure that doctors can deliver quality care without the fear of facing complaints. This will require a multifaceted approach that includes changes to the way complaints are handled, educating doctors on defensive medicine, and potentially updating the legal framework to better accommodate the realities of medical practice. It's clear from the information given that the current system, designed to protect patients, is instead having the unintended consequence of fostering wasteful healthcare practices. Tonight, the healthcare community needs to begin tackling this storm of defensive medicine to ensure patient care is prioritized and resources are not squandered.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Nick Xenophon Team senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore will resign from the Senate because she has dual British citizenship by descent through her mother. At a press conference in Adelaide on Wednesday, Kakoschke-Moore announced she had received advice from the UK Home Office on Friday, confirmed by a specialist barrister, that she had received British citizenship from her mother, who was born in Singapore in 1957. Kakoschke-Moore had always believed she was not British because her father had received advice from the British embassy in Oman she was not eligible for citizenship when she was 12. She said she was “heartbroken” to discover she was British, which she described as “extremely surprising” because she “had no reason to believe I was a British citizen until that point”. Kakoschke-Moore explained that her mother was born in Singapore, a former British colony, which gave her “citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies” and became a British citizen in 1983 when the British Nationality Act came into effect. Kakoschke-Moore, born in Darwin in 1985, then gained that citizenship by descent. Kakoschke-Moore said she would request the matter be referred to the high court to determine how the vacancy would be filled, adding she would “continue to run” for the NXT and “at this stage” her ambition was to come back to the Senate. A recount of the 2016 Senate election would likely elect the NXT candidate Tim Storrer, who unsuccessfully attempted to replace Xenophon in the Senate by challenging the party’s chosen successor. Xenophon said he and his colleagues were “devastated” by the loss of Kakoschke-Moore from the Senate, but predicted it was “not the end of her political career”. Xenophon said the party had preliminary legal advice the position may not be filled by a recount, claiming the situation was “uncharted legal territory” because of the high court’s recent decision involving Hollie Hughes.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Nick Xenophon Team senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore will resign from the Senate because she has dual British citizenship by descent through her mother. At a press conference in Adelaide on Wednesday, Kakoschke-Moore announced she had received advice from the UK Home Office on Friday, confirmed by a specialist barrister, that she had received British citizenship from her mother, who was born in Singapore in 1957. Kakoschke-Moore had always believed she was not British because her father had received advice from the British embassy in Oman she was not eligible for citizenship when she was 12. She said she was “heartbroken” to discover she was British, which she described as “extremely surprising” because she “had no reason to believe I was a British citizen until that point”. Kakoschke-Moore explained that her mother was born in Singapore, a former British colony, which gave her “citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies” and became a British citizen in 1983 when the British Nationality Act came into effect. Kakoschke-Moore, born in Darwin in 1985, then gained that citizenship by descent. Kakoschke-Moore said she would request the matter be referred to the high court to determine how the vacancy would be filled, adding she would “continue to run” for the NXT and “at this stage” her ambition was to come back to the Senate. A recount of the 2016 Senate election would likely elect the NXT candidate Tim Storrer, who unsuccessfully attempted to replace Xenophon in the Senate by challenging the party’s chosen successor. Xenophon said he and his colleagues were “devastated” by the loss of Kakoschke-Moore from the Senate, but predicted it was “not the end of her political career”. Xenophon said the party had preliminary legal advice the position may not be filled by a recount, claiming the situation was “uncharted legal territory” because of the high court’s recent decision involving Hollie Hughes.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Speaking at his Papitalai parish church on Los Negros Island, across a small bay from the detention centre, Taulam said the enforced shutdown of the centre – in which 380 men remain – had left people vulnerable and suffering. Over years of pastoral care, he has built up friendships with many of those in the centre, he told the Guardian and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. “Now when they say they have no food, no water, no lights, they are deprived physically but they are saying too, that the physical is also spiritual for them. They are deprived of faith. They are suffering.” Taulam said no government seemed willing to take care of the men who remain in the centre. “Australia seems to be saying, ‘Papua New Guinea, this is your responsibility’. And Papua New Guinea is saying to Australia, ‘Do your work, clean up your mess.’ And while this is going on, these people are suffering.” “I’ve been talking with them, going to see them.

The problem with this is that it totally ignores the venerable history of French cinema, which plays out as a long, drawn-out visual love letter to the act of smoking.

The flare of a match or lighter, and then the upward curl of smoke are forever seductive. All the best French film directors knew this and have exploited it endlessly. Think of virtually any famous French film and cigarettes are an essential ingredient. Jean-Luc Godard’s À Bout de Souffle (Breathless) opens with Jean-Paul Belmondo driving and smoking, a fag dangling from his lower lip, and for the next 90 minutes he chainsmokes his way through the entire story until, shot in the back, he runs away, still puffing, to collapse and die on the street.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The former Liberal minister Philip Ruddock has been appointed to examine if Australian law adequately protects the human right to religious freedom. Ruddock’s appointment by cabinet, announced on Wednesday, is designed to head off a bruising debate about religious amendments in a same-sex marriage bill, but the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the review was “no substitute” for those amendments. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said it was important to look at the issue of religious freedom carefully, in light of the yes vote and impending legislation on marriage equality. While senior conservatives including Peter Dutton and Mathias Cormann have publicly suggested a religious freedom bill can be considered next year, separately to a marriage bill, others including Morrison and Liberal senator, David Fawcett, have insisted it be considered at the same time. Ruddock has been asked to report by 31 March. Turnbull said a variety of proposals for legislative changes to protect freedom of religion have been put forward in recent months but many of them go beyond the immediate issue of marriage, and parliament needed to be wary of them. “Any reforms to protect religious freedom at large should be undertaken carefully,” he said in a statement on Wednesday. “There is a high risk of unintended consequences when parliament attempts to legislate protections for basic rights and freedoms, such as freedom of religion. The government is particularly concerned to prevent uncertainties caused by generally worded bill of rights-style declarations. “This will be a timely expert stocktake to inform consideration of any necessary legislative reforms.” Turnbull said Ruddock was the right person to conduct the review because he had served as Australia’s special envoy for human rights.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Last weekend Faced with a quiet moment, Donald Trump tends to stir up a spat with a sports star or a celebrity, seemingly in order to open new fronts in America’s “culture wars” and reassure his base about which side he’s on. When it comes to sports, Trump’s targets are often African American, and he pursued a few such targets this week. Regular readers may remember that when last week the president asked China to free three UCLA basketball players accused of shoplifting, his main concern was that the players would thank him, which they did. But when LaVar Ball, the father of one of the arrested players and an inveterate attention seeker himself, questioned just how critical a role Trump actually played, it enraged the president. “I should have left them in jail!” he tweeted on Sunday, adding six hours later that he “should have gotten his son [LiAngelo Ball] out during my next trip to China instead … Very ungrateful!” Trump – whose sons Donald Jr and Eric are well-known hunters – also gave more clues about his perhaps surprisingly critical views on the US Fish and Wildlife Service plan to allow imports of elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia, tweeting: “Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal.” Monday Returning to his racially tinged offensive, Trump singled out Marshawn Lynch of the Oakland Raiders for sitting down during the playing of The Star-Spangled Banner. “Great disrespect!” tweeted the president, adding another dog whistle for the base when he pointed out that Lynch had stood up “for the Mexican anthem”. Black athletes have been protesting during the national anthem since the summer, to highlight police violence and racial injustice. Tuesday Sexual misconduct accusations against the Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore are a less divisive issue, at least outside Alabama – Moore has been condemned widely, including by numerous GOP figures. But after some prevaricating Trump came down on the candidate’s side. Asked the memorable question “Is Roy Moore, [allegedly] a child molester, better than a Democrat?”, Trump pointed out that Moore denied the claims against him, one of which involves a woman who was 14 at the time, and said: “I can tell you one thing for sure: we don’t need a liberal person in there, a Democrat.” Trump has himself been accused by numerous women of sexual harassment.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Thibaut Courtois does not expect discussions to resume over a new contract at Chelsea until the end of the season, when he will be entering the final 12 months of his deal. The previous round of talks in May failed to reach an agreement. The goalkeeper, who spent three successful years on loan at Atlético Madrid after joining Chelsea from Genk, has been an integral part of the team who have won two Premier League titles in the past three seasons. His agent, Christophe Henrotay, held talks with the champions towards the end of last season, seeking to take the Belgian’s wages closer to the £200,000 a week level enjoyed by Eden Hazard at Stamford Bridge and another of the division’s elite goalkeepers, David de Gea, at Manchester United. Although Courtois – who kept 16 clean sheets in the league last season – is happy at Chelsea and willing to sign improved terms, he has regularly expressed his fondness for life in La Liga, where his situation continues to be monitored by a number of clubs, notably Real Madrid. His former girlfriend has returned to Spain with the couple’s two children. Chelsea are well aware of interest in him from Spanish clubs and will be anxious to achieve a positive resolution before the player goes into the final year of his deal, potentially damaging his value and their bargaining position. “The most important thing is to perform well for myself and the team,” said Courtois before the Champions League game against Qarabag. “Regarding my contract, that’s something where Chelsea must deal with my agent.

Recognizing the possible interest from Spanish clubs, the Blues want to secure a successful resolution to the contract negotiations before Courtois enters the final year of his deal, which could otherwise weaken their bargaining position and reduce his transfer value.\n\\n\\nIn媒体原文没有提到比分和正在进行的欧冠比赛是否发生了变化，所以没有提供相关信息。库尔图瓦在面对媒体时也表明了自己和俱乐部对于合同的具体情况保持同样的立场，即切尔西需和他的经纪人直接沟通，并且他现在专注于在场上为团队和自己表现出色。Is there anything else I can help with?",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Unity Spencer, who has died aged 87, was perhaps best known for being the daughter of the artist Stanley Spencer, but she was also a talented painter in her own right, a skilful realist with a powerful imaginative vision. Two of her best and most memorable works, which reveal her father’s influence, are a striking self-portrait from 1954, and a 1957 portrait of Stanley himself. She had three solo shows of her paintings in London, and contributed to many mixed exhibitions, from the London Group to the Royal Academy shows. The first of her one-person shows was at Lauderdale House in Highgate, in 1993, the second at the Boundary Gallery in St John’s Wood in 2001, both in north London, but it was the third that really established her reputation. In 2015, the Fine Art Society in Bond Street mounted the first West End exhibition of her work, to coincide with the publication of her autobiography, Lucky to Be an Artist. Fifty of her paintings from all periods were shown along with her etchings, accompanied by a group of pictures by her family: works by her parents, her uncles Gilbert Spencer and Richard Carline, and by her grandfather George Carline. This show came at the suggestion of a friend, the painter David Inshaw. He recalled visiting her house in Clapham (where, according to her son, she had inscribed “Daring, Joy and Love” on her bedroom wall), expecting to find it hung with paintings by herself and her parents.

    "response":"<|begin_of_thought|>\nIn this task, I need to provide two summaries of the given text while including the mentioned words. I will first analyze the text to understand the main points. The text is a biography of Unity Spencer, who has passed away at age 87. She was a talented painter and the daughter of the artist Stanley Spencer. Her art was influenced by her father's work. She had several solo shows in London and was the subject of a special exhibition at the Fine Art Society in 2015.\n\nNow, I will create two summaries, ensuring I incorporate the required words. \n\\n\\nThought 1: For the first summary, I will introduce Unity Spencer as a daughter of Stanley Spencer who died at 87. I will mention that she was also a painter in her own right and had a few major events showcasing her talented works. To include the word 'birth' I will mention that while her birth is not directly mentioned in the passage, it is implied by mentioning her age at death. I will incorporate 'death' by referring to her passing. The word 'event' relates to the exhibitions and shows she participated in. 'Load' and 'nurse' won't fit directly, but I can imply 'load' with the phrase 'burden of defending her parents' work'. 'Nurse' can be incorporated indirectly as a hint towards her upbringing by mentioning her family's eccentric lifestyle.\n\\n\\nThought 2: In the second summary, I will focus on her career as a painter. I will mention that although her paintings were influenced by her father's style, she stood on her own as an artist and had multiple events that celebrated her work. To incorporate 'birth', I will briefly mention the name of hers and her father Stanley Spencer's mother. To employ 'death', I will again use her passing as 87 as an example. 'Event' can be used to refer to her retrospectives and solo shows. To use 'load', I will paraphrase that defending her parent's style was a large task she was burdened with, and for 'nurse', I will infer that throughout her life, she was a maternal figure to promote the continuity of her family's artistic legacy. \n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n**Summary 1:** Unity Spencer was born to the artist Stanley Spencer and passed away at age 87.

Unity was not merely acknowledged for her last name or her artistic parentage, but was lauded over her years as a skilled painter. Events like the exhibitions at the Fine Art Society and special retrospectives at challenging venues like the Boundary Gallery, saw her nurture a batch of works from all stages in her life. In safeguarding her family's name, she carried the load of often explaining her parents' eccentric lifestyle and work style.

The furniture maker, which employs 547 people in 50 shops and manufactures upholstered furnishings in Thetford, Norfolk, has struggled amid a tough retail market in which shoppers are shying away from spending on expensive items for their homes. Multiyork had reportedly been put on the market by its major shareholder, the furnishings tycoon Charles Wade of Wade Furniture Group, which also owns beds maker Feather &amp; Black. The two brands are run as separate entities and the administration does not include the bed maker. Administrators said that Multiyork has fallen into financial difficulties as it could not meet its financial liabilities as a result of trading losses. The company had net debt of £1.9m at its 2016 year end, according to the latest accounts filed at Companies House. It recorded a profit of just £479,000 in the 53 weeks to 2 October 2016 after a £714,000 loss a year before. The company increased sales by 5.4% to £50.4m, partly thanks to an extra week’s trading on the year before. The brand, which was founded in 1978 and initially operated in the Old Mill site in the village of Mellis, Suffolk, was rescued from receivership by Wade in 1995. Allan Graham of Duff &amp; Phelps, who was appointed joint administrator on Tuesday, said the business would continue to run for a short period as administrators continue to look for a buyer.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The article claims that local authorities take over the cost of care when a person’s assets fall below £23,250, but in reality, the local authorities continue to take £1 for every £250 until assets are depleted to £14,250. After this point, residents can keep the remaining sum, but they continue to contribute through pension deductions and family top-up fees.

The writer's mother, who has severe dementia and is in a nursing home for over four years, has been made to sell her two-bedroom flat and use her savings to pay over £250,000 in costs. The alarming truth about care homes is that once the self-funding individual's resources are exhausted, local authorities take over the payment process, often due to the significant costs associated with care homes.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n An alleged burglar appears to have taken the saying “sleeping on the job” literally after passing out with a half-eaten pie and covered in Doritos in a house near Glasgow. The 46-year-old man is alleged to have broken into the house in Coatbridge on Monday night, but to have then been too tired to actually leave. He was eventually discovered by the homeowners, who alerted the police. Monklands police tweeted: A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: “At around 11.50pm on Monday, police were called to a house on Corsewall Street in Coatbridge after a householder discovered a man in his house. “A 46-year-old will be subject of a report to the procurator fiscal.” It is not the first time a burglar has fallen asleep on the job. A few years ago, Texan Kevin Connelly found a burglar asleep in his guest room in Houston and called the police. In Florida, the Sarasota county sheriff’s office was called after a cleaning lady found a man sleeping on a bed next to a bagful of jewellery he had intended to steal. “The man was still sleeping when deputies arrived. They were able to snap his photo with the loot without him even noticing,” the sheriff said at the time. And in Purcell, Oklahoma, Steven Walker, who lived alone, said he was surprised to return from a doctor’s appointment and discover a stranger in his home.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n An alleged burglar appears to have taken the saying “sleeping on the job” literally after passing out with a half-eaten pie and covered in Doritos in a house near Glasgow. The 46-year-old man is alleged to have broken into the house in Coatbridge on Monday night, but to have then been too tired to actually leave. He was eventually discovered by the homeowners, who alerted the police. Monklands police tweeted: A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: “At around 11.50pm on Monday, police were called to a house on Corsewall Street in Coatbridge after a householder discovered a man in his house. “A 46-year-old will be subject of a report to the procurator fiscal.” It is not the first time a burglar has fallen asleep on the job. A few years ago, Texan Kevin Connelly found a burglar asleep in his guest room in Houston and called the police. In Florida, the Sarasota county sheriff’s office was called after a cleaning lady found a man sleeping on a bed next to a bagful of jewellery he had intended to steal. “The man was still sleeping when deputies arrived. They were able to snap his photo with the loot without him even noticing,” the sheriff said at the time. And in Purcell, Oklahoma, Steven Walker, who lived alone, said he was surprised to return from a doctor’s appointment and discover a stranger in his home.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"<<Chapter of a Fighter's Redemption>>\n\nThe intense confrontation opens with James Toney interrogating the narrator, questioning the wish to halt his fighting career. The article delves into the fascinating transformation of Toney, who, despite a violent past marred by crime and encounters with 'trash', seemed to have found a harmonious equilibrium in his chosen path. His journey from the rough outskirts of Detroit, where he once peddled 'crack' and toted a 'gun', to being renowned as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world, is quite the 'result' of both his individual endeavor and the pivotal role played by his resilient mother, Sherry.\n\nFrom a single 'chapter' in the narrative, that is the horrific and tragic event of his father's gunfire, Toney has come a long way. His upbringing in an environment entirely overshadowed by violence and tumult - a 'disaster' of sorts - was probably a contributing factor in him finding solace in the 'floor' of a boxing ring rather than on the streets where his previous lifestyle left him mostly with bloodied 'trash'. Sherry Toney's resolve and her determination to steer James away from a life of violence were instrumental in his transformation. Her own survival of a traumatic 'floor', a shoot-out with her partner, became a turning point in the story of the once formidable boxer.\n\nThis story speaks profoundly about the power of resilience and the impact of the mothers played in shaping the lives of their children. Despite the odds stacked up against James Toney, he was successful in diverting attention from the 'trash' of his past to the polished gem of his fighting career. <|end_of_solution|>",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n At this stage in her career, no one expects Björk’s latest record to sound much like her last one. And yet it’s hard to avoid heaving a thankful sigh when Arisen My Senses, the opening track of her ninth studio album, Utopia, crashes into life: birdsong giving way to bright splashes of electronics, beatific-sounding harp chords and cascading beats not unlike the oft-sampled rhythm track of Schoolly D’s old rap classic PSK, What Does It Mean? It sounds positively ecstatic, which comes as a relief. Utopia’s predecessor, 2015’s Vulnicura, was a remarkable record, a latterday entry into the canon of legendary break-up albums. It attained its place alongside Marvin Gaye’s Here, My Dear and Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks by setting its fathomless misery to atonal string arrangements and abstract electronics that, during its central track, kept vanishing into a single flatlining beep. It was raw, brave, challenging, unique and all the other adjectives heaped on it in reviews, but with the best will in the world, any album so harrowing that the appearance of gloom-laden vocalist Anohni constitutes a moment of light relief is going to be one that defies you to listen to it repeatedly. Utopia reanimates Vulnicura’s collaboration with Venezuela-born electronic auteur Arca, but is made of lighter material. Aside from his endlessly shifting soundscapes, distorted beats and penchant for sonic tapestries made from manipulated vocal samples, the album’s primary sound is woodwind, provided by an assembly of 12 female flautists from Reykjavik, which automatically lends it a far airier quality than the claustrophobic Vulnicura. It is, Björk says, her “Tinder album”, and its advance billing as a kind of Songs for Swinging Bachelorettes is borne out by its lyrics, which are obsessed both with technology and the vicissitudes of budding romance. “Is this excess texting blessing?” ponders Blissing Me, the saga of “two music nerds … sending each other MP3s”, before reverting to grief: “our physical union a fantasy, I just fell in love with a song”.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

It describes the artist Björk and her latest album \"Utopia.\" The text contrasts \"Utopia\" favorably against \"Vulnicura,\" a previous album that was intensely personal and melancholic. \"Utopia\" is lighter and focuses on technology and romance influenced by Arikan and the involvement of 12 female flautists.\n\\n\\nStep 2: Summarizing and Brainstorming\nTo summarize, we must capture the overall impression that \"Utopia\" offers a fresh sound in comparison with \"Vulnicura,\" emphasizing its collaborative efforts and its use of technology and romance themes. \n\\n\\nStep 3: Incorporating the Word 'Injury' \nHowever, the requirement to begin the first paragraph with 'injury' is unusual and might be a hint at the emotional undertones of \"Vulnicura,\" or a possible play on the word 'injury' related to Björk herself or emotions conveyed in music. \n\\n\\nStep 4: Synthesize the Information\nConsidering all considerations, the first paragraph would highlight \"Vulnicura,\" a self-described 'injury' for its harshness, setting it up as a contrast to \"Utopia.\" Following paragraphs will then address the novelty of \"Utopia.\" \n\\n\\nStep 5: Reassessing and Refining\nTo ensure smooth flow, I will craft one paragraph contrasting \"Vulnicura\" with \"Utopia,\" another focusing on \"Utopia\" production aspects like Arikan's contributions and the flautists, and a final one on thematic content noted in the article. This structure should align with the requirement for three paragraphs and lay down a logical summary.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nInjury is a term that might come to mind when discussing Björk's previous album, \"Vulnicura\", which was intensely personal and harrowing, with its somber tone creating an album so powerful that its somberness was unavoidable. In stark contrast, \"Utopia\" serves as a refreshing break from such emotional weight. It introduces a lively and fresh sound, blending with the technological base with a touch of romance and shifts away from the heavier tones of her previous works. \n\nThe production of \"Utopia\" takes a significant turn with Björk collaborating again with Arca, a Venezuelan-born electronic music producer, incorporating electronic music withSampling with abstract electronic layers that have replaced the previous notable strict experimental tones. Equally notable is the significant use of traditional woodwind instruments, with 12 flute players contributing lighter, airier notes that offer a breath of fresh air compared to the claustrophobic sounds of \"Vulnicura.\"\n\nThematically, \"Utopia\" delves into a mix of technology and romance, often revolving around themes of modern love and relationships. Her \"Tinder album\" stands out for its modernist love perspective, emphasizing how current technology and traditional methods of love collide and metamorphose into a contemporary songwriting canvas. For instance, \"Blissing Me\" questions the role of excessive texting and the eternal connection established through love. \n\n<|end_of_solution|>",

Hammond’s colleagues used the first of four days of scheduled debate about the budget to praise not just his high-profile announcements on housing, but also his commitment of £3bn to prepare for any Brexit eventuality. In his response to the budget, Corbyn – it is the leader of the opposition who traditionally speaks rather than the shadow chancellor – said Hammond had completely failed to tackle a national crisis of stagnation and falling wages. “The test of a budget is how it affects the reality of people’s lives all around this country,” the Labour leader said. “And I believe as the days go ahead, and this budget unravels, the reality will be – a lot of people will be no better off. And the misery that many are in will be continuing.” Largely eschewing direct focus on Hammond’s specific announcements in favour of a broader critique of the government’s wider economic approach, Corbyn castigated Hammond for again missing deficit reduction targets, and for a continued spending squeeze on schools and the police. Speaking about housing, Corbyn said rough sleeping had doubled since 2010, and that this Christmas 120,000 children would be living in temporary accommodation. “We need a large-scale publicly funded housebuilding programme, not this government’s accounting tricks and empty promises.”Summing up, he said: “We were promised a revolutionary budget.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Ships and planes hunting for an Argentinian submarine that went missing in the south Atlantic a week ago are to return to a previously searched area as relatives of those onboard voiced their frustrations with rescue efforts. An Argentinian navy spokesman, Captain Enrique Balbi, said search teams would return to the area about 30 miles north of the ARA San Juan’s last registered position after a “hydro-acoustic anomaly” was determined by the US and specialist agencies to have been produced just hours after the final contact with the submarine on 15 November. “It’s a noise. We don’t want to speculate” about what caused it, Balbi said. With the seven-day limit on the ARA San Juan’s oxygen reserves having been reached on Wednesday morning, what hopes that remain are pinned on the submarine having been able to replenish its oxygen supply by surfacing at some point during the past week. Helena Alfaro was just one of many family members who congregated at the Mar del Plata naval base where the submarine was originally scheduled to arrive on Monday. “I feel like I’m waiting for a corpse,” said Alfaro, the sister of Cristian Ibañez, a radar officer on the missing submarine. “So much protocol, so much protocol,” she complained to TN news network, referring to the Argentinian navy’s long delay in advising the president, Mauricio Macri, that it had lost contact with the submarine. Justifying the delay, navy chiefs said that military protocol advises a 48-hour waiting period before beginning search efforts for submarines lost at sea. “I feel like I’m at a wake, that’s how I feel,” said a tearful Alfaro.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

An Argentinian navy spokesman, Captain Enrique Balbi, said search teams would return to the area about 30 miles north of the ARA San Juan’s last registered position after a “hydro-acoustic anomaly” was determined by the US and specialist agencies to have been produced just hours after the final contact with the submarine on 15 November. “It’s a noise. We don’t want to speculate” about what caused it, Balbi said. With the seven-day limit on the ARA San Juan’s oxygen reserves having been reached on Wednesday morning, what hopes that remain are pinned on the submarine having been able to replenish its oxygen supply by surfacing at some point during the past week. Helena Alfaro was just one of many family members who congregated at the Mar del Plata naval base where the submarine was originally scheduled to arrive on Monday. “I feel like I’m waiting for a corpse,” said Alfaro, the sister of Cristian Ibañez, a radar officer on the missing submarine. “So much protocol, so much protocol,” she complained to TN news network, referring to the Argentinian navy’s long delay in advising the president, Mauricio Macri, that it had lost contact with the submarine. Justifying the delay, navy chiefs said that military protocol advises a 48-hour waiting period before beginning search efforts for submarines lost at sea. “I feel like I’m at a wake, that’s how I feel,” said a tearful Alfaro.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The Simon Langton grammar school for boys in Canterbury, which caused controversy last year when it invited its former pupil Milo Yiannopoulos, the rightwing controversialist, to speak, sparked fresh concerns this week with a new debating forum that it said was designed to be “an antidote to the poison of political correctness”. Some parents and pupils backed the school. But now it has distanced itself from the term “unsafe space” after other pupils and parents voiced their alarm on social media. The local Labour MP whose sons attended the school but have now left also voiced her reservations. The scheme’s name is a reference to the phrase “safe space” – a zone in which a person or category of people can feel confident they will not be exposed to discrimination, criticism, harassment or any other emotional or physical harm. The head of school, Ken Moffat, said the phrase unsafe space was “a bit of a misnomer”. “The name is the Tong Centre for Creative Research, it is not called ‘the unsafe space’ and that’s not a phrase I am wedded to and expect to see wither over time.” In a letter to parents, Moffat dismissed concerns raised in media reports. “Our aim is quite simple: to continue with what we are already doing in allowing our young men and women to debate interesting ideas at the highest level possible with speakers from both within and without the school community,” he wrote. “Just because we use the term ‘freedom of speech’ does not mean we will indulge homophobic, xenophobic, racist or sexist beliefs.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The summit between the three leaders, deeply involved in the Syria conflict, targets a settlement recognising Bashar al-Assad's continued rule under a reformed constitution.\n\nPutin argues the Syrian people should determine their future and agree on their statehood principles. However, he acknowledges that the process needs compromise and concessions from all participants. After hosting Assad and holding phone discussions with other world leaders, Putin highlighted the potential for joint rebuilding efforts in Syria. Putin urged Iran and Turkey to consider the reconstruction plans for the devastated country.\n<|end_of_solution|>",

That lends weight to the suggestion that the England Knights concept – an emerging talent side similar to union’s England Saxons – may return to play in the tournament. Egan, however, would be keen to see the strongest England side possible travel to Ireland to play in Dublin.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n New nuclear power stations in the UK can no longer compete with windfarms on price, according to the boss of a German energy company’s green power arm. Hans Bunting, the chief operating officer of renewables at Innogy SE, part of the company that owns the UK energy supplier npower, said offshore windfarms had become mainstream and were destined to become even cheaper because of new, bigger turbines. Asked whether nuclear groups that want to build new reactors in the UK could compete with windfarms on cost, even when their intermittency was taken into account, Bunting replied: “Obviously they can’t.” His comments came after MPs criticised the £30bn cost to consumers for EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and said ministers should revisit the case for new nuclear before proceeding with more projects. Innogy recently secured a subsidy of £74.75 per megawatt hour of power to build a windfarm off the Lincolnshire coast, which is £17.75 cheaper than Hinkley and should be completed about three years earlier. “What we see now [with prices] is with today’s technology. It’s not about tomorrow’s technology, which is about [to come in] 2025, 2027, when Hinkley will most likely come to the grid ... and then it [windfarms] will be even cheaper.” While the company is planning to use the most powerful turbines in the world today for the Lincolnshire windfarm, Bunting said even bigger ones in development would drive costs down further. “A few years ago everyone thought 10MW [turbines] was the maximum, now we’re talking about 15[MW]. It seems the sky is the limit,” he said. “[It] means less turbines for the same capacity, less steel in the ground, less cables, even bigger rotors catching more wind, so it will become cheaper.” However, EDF argued that nuclear was also on a path to lower costs. “Early offshore wind projects started at around £150 per MW\/h and developers have shown they can offer lower prices by repeating projects with an established supply chain – the same is true for nuclear,” an EDF spokesman said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.
