      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n It was the frog that pushed me over the edge. I’ve never been a Harry Potter fan myself – I was already out of kids’ books when they first came out, and those clever grown-up covers weren’t enough to tempt me back – but I’d always admired JK Rowling from afar. Who wouldn’t? A writer whose imagination transfixed the world, whose riches now exceed those of the Queen, but who has founded a children’s charity, pays her taxes in full, and remains both poised and politically engaged: as role models go, it is hard to think of a better one. So I was pleased when my seven-year-old son went Harry Potter crazy. Having never read to himself before, he was suddenly racing through book after book, his bedside light on late into the night. His brother and several of his friends caught the bug – just as the Suez canal flowed through Clarissa Eden’s drawing room, Hogwarts overshadowed our house, as children constantly dashed about on broomsticks, casting spells and looking for snitches. It was impressive to see the “Harry Potter effect” in action: the magical power that, in the two decades since its first publication, has revitalised the children’s publishing industry, encouraged millions of children to read, sold more than 400m copies across the world, and generated a cultural empire worth £20bn. Less pleasant, however, was the realisation that there was a marketing juggernaut poised to capitalise on my son’s enthusiasm. Unlike those first readers 20 years ago, the children discovering Harry Potter now are immediately faced with a multibillion-pound industry trading in Potter-themed “experiences” and paraphernalia.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Featuring the work of high-profile and amateur designers, in campaign billboards, T-shirts and cartoons, it will show graphic design’s power as a tool for political discussion, debate and provocation. • Opens 28 March, Design Museum, London.

Because if Simeone never told Setién, on Sunday afternoon he showed him. Really, really showed him. It was easy to imagine him barely suppressing a smirk, winking his way back to the dressing room at the Benito Villamarín and breaking into a giggle as soon as he got through the door, points won and point made. At the same time as he arrived, midfielder Koke stood pitchside. Talking to the telly, Koke’s opening line couldn’t have been clearer: “Betis were spectacular,” he said. “They played very well, they play very nice football.” Antonio Adán, Betis’s goalkeeper, agreed: “The football we played was incredible,” he insisted, “our opponents were truly dominated.” The problem was, a ‘but’ hung in the air and it was a big one.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theresa May has declared that tackling climate change and reducing its effects on poorer countries is a “moral imperative”, as the Conservative party renewed its push to portray itself as environmentally friendly. The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron’s 2005 efforts to show the Tories cared about global warming. Ahead of this week’s climate change summit in Paris, May said: “There is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.” She described coal as “one of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power” and hailed the “enormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents”. May’s commitment to the issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real. However, the prime minister insists “tackling climate change and mitigating its effects for the world’s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces”. At the summit she will announce a £140m boost to funding for poorer communities affected by climate change through deforestation or vulnerability to natural disasters and extreme weather, plus £15m of additional support for reconstruction on Dominica in the Caribbean, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. It comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being asked by party officials to show off their green credentials after internal polling showed the level of concern among younger voters about environmental issues. The party has been alarmed by the backlash against May’s support for a free vote on foxhunting, the omission of a ban on the ivory trade from the manifesto and its lack of support for an amendment that would have recognised in UK law that animals feel pain. They have since backtracked on all three issues.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  At the end of your response, please explicitly add a postscript starting with P.S."

Putin said a significant part of Russian forces would be withdrawn from Syria, though scepticism was warranted given that two previous announcements have been met with little noticeable scaling down. This time, however, could be different. Talk of the total defeat of Isis may be premature, but there is no doubt that Russian air power, combined with Syrian forces and Iran-backed Shia militias on the ground, has decisively shifted the balance of power in the long Syrian civil war. President Bashar al-Assad was on the brink of defeat when Russia entered the conflict in 2015. With sustained airstrikes on both moderate rebel groups and extremists, Moscow has helped Assad win back control of much of the country. The Russian and Syrian air forces were accused of brutal bombing tactics, including deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure, which the Russian military has always denied. Assad’s departure from office, long demanded by western powers, is no longer on the immediate agenda.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  There should be 1 paragraphs.

So, could they help me keep my resolution this year? Charles Duhigg, the author of The Power of Habit, certainly thinks so. He tells me there is “a ton of research” to show that New Year resolutions are an effective way to make changes: they create a sense of expectation and ceremony, while the link to a particular day helps to fit our experiences into a narrative of before and after, which makes change more likely. “There are people who will decide on 1 January to lose two stone and who will keep it off for the rest of their lives, others who have been smoking two packs a day for over a decade who will decide to quit and who will still not smoke this time next year,” he says.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The prime minister made a concession on Monday by agreeing to set up a new committee of MPs to monitor any proposed legal changes as EU legislation is converted into the British statute book. She had been facing a parliamentary defeat over the issue during the debate on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday, after a widespread backbench revolt among remain- and leave-supporting MPs.

One Conservative rebel said May was in trouble over these two issues because there were enough dissatisfied Conservatives combined with Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and other opposition MPs to defeat the government. The MP said the government and the rebels were currently in a standoff with neither side prepared to back down. However, government sources were confident May had managed to convince enough of her backbenchers not to defy the whip by indicating that a vote was likely to happen well before the date of leaving and promising a second vote on legislation implementing the EU withdrawal agreement hammered out in Brussels on Friday. The appetite for rebellion among Conservative MPs will become clearer during the two days of debate and voting on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The government granted a concession, allowing a special committee of MPs to monitor the transition of EU laws into UK laws. The prime minister was facing an imminent parliamentary failure following widespread dissent from pro-Remain and pro-Leave backbench MPs. However, the government won't step down from its plan to codify the exit date as March 29, 2019, and dismiss the appeals from some Conservative MPs to vote on the terms of the deal before that date. A dissident Conservative MP alleged that the government's stance on these two issues could lead to a defeat in Parliament, with a sufficient number of dissatisfied Conservatives and opposition MPs. The government, on the other hand, is optimistic that May managed to persuade enough of her party's MPs against rebellion by indicating an earlier vote and a follow-up vote on the legislation implementing the EU withdrawal agreement.

    "filtered_answer":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\nTheresa May has been forced to accept more scrutiny of Brexit lawmaking to head off a Tory revolt but is still heading for a showdown over how MPs get to vote on the final deal and whether the date for leaving should be fixed in law. The prime minister made a concession on Monday by agreeing to set up a new committee of MPs to monitor any proposed legal changes as EU legislation is converted into the British statute book. She had been facing a parliamentary defeat over the issue during the debate on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday, after a widespread backbench revolt among remain- and leave-supporting MPs. However, the government has not backed down on its intention to fix the day of Brexit as 29 March 2019 or acceded to the demands of soft Brexit Tory MPs who wanted a meaningful vote on the terms of the final deal before that date. One Conservative rebel said May was in trouble over these two issues because there were enough dissatisfied Conservatives combined with Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and other opposition MPs to defeat the government. The MP said the government and the rebels were currently in a standoff with neither side prepared to back down. However, government sources were confident May had managed to convince enough of her backbenchers not to defy the whip by indicating that a vote was likely to happen well before the date of leaving and promising a second vote on legislation implementing the EU withdrawal agreement hammered out in Brussels on Friday. The appetite for rebellion among Conservative MPs will become clearer during the two days of debate and voting on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday and Wednesday. Up to 25 had threatened to revolt unless May promised more scrutiny over Brexit lawmaking, but No 10’s concessions appear to have allayed concerns among the would-be troublemakers. The government will agree to establish a new committee of MPs to help weed out the overuse of “Henry VIII powers”, which allow ministers to make changes to secondary legislation as it is transposed.\n-------\nPrime Minister Theresa May had to yield to increased oversight of Brexit's legislative adjustments to quell a rebellion within her Conservative Party, yet she's still likely to clash over whether MPs should have a say in the final agreement and if the departure date should be hardcoded. The government granted a concession, allowing a special committee of MPs to monitor the transition of EU laws into UK laws. The prime minister was facing an imminent parliamentary failure following widespread dissent from pro-Remain and pro-Leave backbench MPs. However, the government won't step down from its plan to codify the exit date as March 29, 2019, and dismiss the appeals from some Conservative MPs to vote on the terms of the deal before that date. A dissident Conservative MP alleged that the government's stance on these two issues could lead to a defeat in Parliament, with a sufficient number of dissatisfied Conservatives and opposition MPs.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Although football has long been America’s favorite child among professional sports, there are clear indicators that the ole pigskin is starting to deflate in fans’ eyes. Football fanatics need not panic: polls show it’s still far ahead of both baseball and basketball in popularity. The 2017 NBA finals averaged 20.4m viewers (a 20-year record), which is roughly the same as the NFL’s regular Sunday night audience of 20.3m, and nowhere near the 2016 Super Bowl über-audience of 111m. Based on just those numbers, football is still kicking professional basketball, baseball and hockey through the goal posts. But America can be fickle. And the Magic 8-Ball of our cultural zeitgeist says, “All signs point to the NBA replacing the NFL as the league of America’s future.” This prediction has nothing to do with the athletes themselves, their level of skill, their heart, or their commitment to their sport. Professional athletes are generally the highest expression of what the human body is capable of doing and therefore inspiring to the fans to reach higher and strive harder. In that way, no sport is superior to any other sport. But when it comes to professional sports, some are more inspirational, more exciting and more entertaining to the general public than others and those sports take on a symbolic meaning for Americans. They come to represent our core values.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['bag', 'edge', 'kiss', 'passenger', 'wear'] in the response.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Although football has long been America’s favorite child among professional sports, there are clear indicators that the ole pigskin is starting to deflate in fans’ eyes. Football fanatics need not panic: polls show it’s still far ahead of both baseball and basketball in popularity. The 2017 NBA finals averaged 20.4m viewers (a 20-year record), which is roughly the same as the NFL’s regular Sunday night audience of 20.3m, and nowhere near the 2016 Super Bowl über-audience of 111m. Based on just those numbers, football is still kicking professional basketball, baseball and hockey through the goal posts. But America can be fickle. And the Magic 8-Ball of our cultural zeitgeist says, “All signs point to the NBA replacing the NFL as the league of America’s future.” This prediction has nothing to do with the athletes themselves, their level of skill, their heart, or their commitment to their sport. Professional athletes are generally the highest expression of what the human body is capable of doing and therefore inspiring to the fans to reach higher and strive harder. In that way, no sport is superior to any other sport. But when it comes to professional sports, some are more inspirational, more exciting and more entertaining to the general public than others and those sports take on a symbolic meaning for Americans. They come to represent our core values.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['bag', 'edge', 'kiss', 'passenger', 'wear'] in the response. Your response should contain at least 13 sentences. Your answer must contain exactly 3 bullet points. Use the markdown bullet points such as:\n* This is point 1. \n* This is point 2 At the end of your response, please explicitly add a postscript starting with P.S.",

However, football enthusiasts should not be too alarmed since football still outshines baseball and basketball when it comes to popularity. Taking into account viewership statistics from 2017, the NBA finals saw an average of 20.4 million viewers, which is identical to the typical Sunday evening NFL audience of 20.3 million. Moreover, this number does not even come close to the record-breaking viewership of the 2016 Super Bowl, which accumulated a staggering 111 million. On paper, football continues to overshadow basketball, baseball, and hockey, but America's loyalty can be unpredictable. The cultural climate's Magic 8-Ball predicts that the NBA may one day surpass the NFL as the professional league that America deems its future champion. This assumption does not stem from a comparison of the players' individual skills or dedication to their game. Professional athletes are awe-inspiring symbols of human capability and motivators to enthusiasts. When it comes to how people perceive sports, some are simply seen as more appealing, exhilarating, and entertaining, and these sports become symbolic representations of our national values. \nNow, I will add bullet points to summarize these paraphrased points.\nP.S.

Nonetheless, football continues to lead baseball and basketball in terms of public appeal. According to 2017 viewership statistics, the NBA finals had a mean audience of 20.4 million, which is very close to the weekly Sunday NFL broadcast's 20.3 million watchers. This figure is far inferior to the record-breaking audience of 111 million who tuned in for the 2016 Super Bowl. On the surface, football still surpasses basketball, baseball, and hockey, yet America's preference may vary with the times. The cultural climate's Magic 8-Ball foresees the NBA potentially overtaking the NFL as the United States' professional sports league champion of the future. This outlook doesn't stem from an analysis of the athletes' individual talents or commitment to the game. Professional players serve as inspiring beacons of human achievement and motivation for fans. When it comes to people's fascination with sports, some are inherently more alluring, more electrifying, and more captivating, and these sports become markers of our national ideals.\n* Football consistently ranks higher in popularity but may be gradually losing ground to basketball.\n* Professional athletes serve as symbols of human achievement that inspire fans, regardless of sport.\n* The NBA could potentially take over from the NFL as the favorite professional league in the future. \nP.S.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The career of Keith Chegwin, who has died aged 60, is characterised by having presented both one of the most popular children’s TV shows in history and a contender for the medium’s most notorious adult entertainment. Viewers saw the best of him in Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (BBC1, 1976-82) and its successor, Saturday Superstore (1982-87), on which Chegwin became an honorary big brother to several generations of goggle-eyed British children, through his cheeky grin and giggle, high-pitched Liverpudlian-accented enthusiasm, and psychedelic knitwear. His presentational worst occurred when Chegwin threw off the novelty sweaters – and, indeed, all clothing except a hat – to front the naturist show Naked (Channel 5, 2000), described by a parliamentarian at the time as the “most disgusting programme ever shown” on British TV. But, while he should be remembered for the work he did with his jolly jumpers on, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for Chegwin, even in his most desperate televisual enterprises. This was due to a natural likability. Only the most sympathetic TV presenters earn nicknames from viewers, and, just as Bruce Forsyth transmuted into “Brucie”, Chegwin rapidly and indelibly became “Cheggers”. That identity was cemented by the title of the third huge success of his children’s career: the music-based gameshow, Cheggers Plays Pop (BBC1, 1978-86), which extended his presenting empire to weekdays. In less prosperous times, though, audiences also admired the impressive and affecting determination with which Cheggers, in the three decades after his Saturday morning career ended, tried to reinvent himself, often against considerable odds. In addition to a common problem for children’s presenters – becoming too old to maintain the required fantasy-sibling dynamic – Chegwin suffered health problems, including alcoholism. Apart from the established presenter-rehab route of reality TV – appearing on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity MasterChef – Chegwin also offered ironic spins on his showbiz rise and fall in 10 projects, including Ricky Gervais’s Extras and Life’s Too Short, and Kill Keith (2011), an improbable comedy-horror Brit film spoof of Tarantino’s Kill Bill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"\"SECTION 1\n'I remain uncertain about whether my family will be confined to our current location,' Kate, a 49-year-old project manager, reflects. Having resided in the Netherlands for 17 years, she worries if she and her children will still possess the freedom to live as they did prior to the vote. Her hope is that they can continue to make plans and pursue goals akin to those of other EU citizens in the region. Her children are likely to attain Dutch citizenship, which she deems beneficial as it grants them considerable rights and advantages as EU members.\n\n***\n\nSECTION 2\nKate, who has been a frequent traveler across European borders due to her work, mentions that fluency in Dutch is not yet one of her skills.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Police investigating a suspected arson attack that killed three people in Salford have arrested four men and a woman. Four fire engines were called to a street in Walkden, Greater Manchester, after the fire broke out at the house at about 5am on Monday. A 14-year-old girl was declared dead at the scene and an eight-year-old boy and seven-year-old girl died in hospital. A three-year-old girl was said to be in a critical condition on Monday afternoon, while a woman, 35, who is understood to be the children’s mother, was in a serious condition. Police are yet to formally identify the victims, but the mother and her 14-year-old daughter have been named locally as Michelle Pearson, 35, and Demi Pearson.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is to launch plans for an opt-out system of organ donation, asking people to overcome their “fatal reluctance” to discuss the issue with family and friends. Under the plans, everybody in England would be presumed to be happy to donate their organs on their death, unless they have signed up to a register stating that they do not want that to happen. In practice, however, it is unlikely that organs would be taken against the wishes of the family. The government’s ambition to change the NHS organ donation programme was announced by Theresa May in her Conservative party conference speech in October. Last year, she said, “500 people died because a suitable organ was not available. And there are 6,500 on the transplant list today.” NHS Blood and Transplant’s figures show that 1,100 families in the UK decided not to allow organ donation because they were unsure, or did not know whether their relatives would have wanted to donate an organ or not. “Every day, three people die for want of a transplant, which is why our historic plans to transform the way organ donation works are so important. We want as many people as possible to have their say as we shape the new opt-out process,” said Hunt. “As well as changing the law, we also need to change the conversation – it can be a difficult subject to broach, but overcoming this fatal reluctance to talk openly about our wishes is key to saving many more lives in the future.” The consultation will ask three questions: how much say should families have in their deceased relative’s decision to donate their organs? When would exemptions to “opt-out” be needed, and what safeguards will be necessary?\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Answer with less than 271 words.

Nor is it in that horrible quasi-sheen that we associate with surviving terrible loss. It’s not in the lifestyle choices she made – living in New York one year, relocating to a home right on a California beach another – and it’s not in the interactions she had with Hollywood royalty, from Warren Beatty (who had a crush on her) to Harrison Ford (who worked as her carpenter for a time). It does not lie in the era-defining work she published in the 1960s and 70s, solo or co-written with husband John Gregory Dunne. No, the glamour of Joan Didion is merely in her willingness to try things. Truly, there is nothing more luxe than that: the decision to dip your toe, your foot, your leg and eventually your enitre body into a new endeavour, and just do it. In Joan Didion: The Centre Will Not Hold, a Netflix documentary produced and directed by Didion’s nephew, the actor Griffin Dunne – the writer is endlessly watchable. She is still a sure speaker, and her hands dance in front of her when she’s being emphatic. But it’s all the stories she pursued, the diversifying of her skill set, from magazines to screenplays, as well as the journey into motherhood: all those opportunities grabbed at, with both hands, that really seize you.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n When Carla Bruni, the Italian-born, French-raised heiress and supermodel quit the catwalk to reinvent herself as a singer-songwriter 20 years ago, many thought it would be short-lived dilettantism. Yet Bruni surprised her detractors, showing herself to be a talented songwriter and a careful, nuanced singer whose jazzy chansons soon topped the French charts. She has continued to do so, even after the inevitable hiatus to her musical career caused by marrying Nicolas Sarkozy, and spending 2008-12 in the Élysée as France’s first lady. She has spoken of suffering from crippling stage fright, but this still-gamine figure, fronting a four-piece, light-jazz band, exudes preternatural poise. Bruni moves with beatific grace, recalling Karl Lagerfeld’s praise of her as “this beautiful creature who can wear anything”; her husky whisper could be a parody of a breathy Gallic siren. Her latest album is a set of cover versions sung in English, French Touch, which is a decidedly mixed bag. It largely works because Bruni pours herself into the songs as if in thrall to them: her pitch-perfect, sparse croon through Depeche Mode’s Enjoy the Silence identifies and amplifies the bleak yearning at the song’s core. The quirky arrangements can be eccentric. Bruni’s cod-jazz take on Willie Nelson’s Crazy veers near to lift muzak, while the jaunty noodling her band introduce to Lou Reed’s Perfect Day sounds at odds with the song’s dark soul. The Clash’s Jimmy Jazz is transformed into a previously unknown genre that can only be described as ethereal boogie-woogie.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n When Carla Bruni, the Italian-born, French-raised heiress and supermodel quit the catwalk to reinvent herself as a singer-songwriter 20 years ago, many thought it would be short-lived dilettantism. Yet Bruni surprised her detractors, showing herself to be a talented songwriter and a careful, nuanced singer whose jazzy chansons soon topped the French charts. She has continued to do so, even after the inevitable hiatus to her musical career caused by marrying Nicolas Sarkozy, and spending 2008-12 in the Élysée as France’s first lady. She has spoken of suffering from crippling stage fright, but this still-gamine figure, fronting a four-piece, light-jazz band, exudes preternatural poise. Bruni moves with beatific grace, recalling Karl Lagerfeld’s praise of her as “this beautiful creature who can wear anything”; her husky whisper could be a parody of a breathy Gallic siren. Her latest album is a set of cover versions sung in English, French Touch, which is a decidedly mixed bag. It largely works because Bruni pours herself into the songs as if in thrall to them: her pitch-perfect, sparse croon through Depeche Mode’s Enjoy the Silence identifies and amplifies the bleak yearning at the song’s core. The quirky arrangements can be eccentric. Bruni’s cod-jazz take on Willie Nelson’s Crazy veers near to lift muzak, while the jaunty noodling her band introduce to Lou Reed’s Perfect Day sounds at odds with the song’s dark soul. The Clash’s Jimmy Jazz is transformed into a previously unknown genre that can only be described as ethereal boogie-woogie.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"\"Quarter of a century ago, when Italian origins, French upbringing model and heiress Carla Bruni decided to transition from a career in modelling to become a singer-songwriter, many speculated it would only be a fleeting phase. Against these expectations, Bruni succeeded in demonstrating her capabilities, becoming a talented songwriter and a meticulous, subtle singer with jazz-influenced chansons that dominated French music charts. She has maintained her musical presence even amidst the inherent pause in her career due to her marriage with Nicolas Sarkozy and her role as the First Lady of France from 2008 to 2012. Despite admitting to having intense stage fright, Bruni, now a still-youthful figure fronting a light-jazz band of four, conveys exceptional self-assurance. She moves with serene elegance, reminiscent of Karl Lagerfeld’s compliment of her as “this beautiful creature who can wear anything”. Her husky voice could be seen as a caricature of a breathy French siren. Bruni’s newest album, 'French Touch', is a collection of cover versions performed in English, which is of mixed quality. However, it mostly succeeds because Bruni performs the songs as if she's captivated by them: her impeccable, minimal crooning through Depeche Mode’s 'Enjoy the Silence' identifies and deepens the desolate longing at the song’s heart. The arrangements can be unusual. Bruni’s jazz take on Willie Nelson’s 'Crazy' nearly sounds like an elevator melody, while Lou Reed’s 'Perfect Day' has a mismatch with the dark soul of the song due to the cheerful melodies introduced by her band. 'The Clash’s Jimmy Jazz' is changed into a previously undreamed-up genre that can only be named as ethereal boogie-woogie.\n* Carla Bruni, once thought to indulge in a short-lived change of career, proved her potential as a singer-songwriter with French jazz tunes that topped the charts, with a slight hiatus due to her role as France's first lady, now releases a mix of affirming and unbalanced English cover versions, all infused with her breathy, nuanced vocals.\"",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Guillermo del Toro’s cold war fantasy The Shape of Water emerged as the frontrunner for the Oscars after picking up a total of seven nominations for the 75th Golden Globes. However, the film looks set to face strong opposition from Steven Spielberg’s Pentagon Papers drama The Post and Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, at a Globes ceremony that will provide the entertainment industry with its first major opportunity to respond to the sexual abuse scandal plaguing Hollywood. Two months after the emergence of allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein that would prompt a further torrent of claims against men in the film industry, the nominations exhibited an already changed landscape in Hollywood. As expected none of the Weinstein-produced films eligible for inclusion received nominations, however there were multiple nominations for Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World, which was forced to replace star Kevin Spacey at short notice, after he was accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and harassment. At the same time, the widely predicted shift towards a more female-focused list of nominees in the wake of the Weinstein scandal did not materialise. Though there were nods for a number of films with female protagonists, including The Shape of Water, Three Billboards, I, Tonya, a biopic of disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding and coming-of-age comedy-drama Lady Bird, there was no room in the nominees for any female directors, while Patty Jenkins’s feminist superhero movie Wonder Woman was snubbed entirely. Leading the way with seven nominations is the Shape of Water, which stars British actor Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaner at a governmental research facility who falls in love with a captured sea creature. Both Del Toro and Hawkins have been nominated in the drama category, for best director and best actress respectively, while Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer have received supporting actor and actress nominations. The film has also received best screenplay and score nominations, as well as best picture in the drama category. It is joined in that latter category by 70s-set drama The Post, which stars Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep as Washington Post higher-ups who clash over whether to publish classified documents about the war in Vietnam.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Guillermo del Toro’s cold war fantasy The Shape of Water emerged as the frontrunner for the Oscars after picking up a total of seven nominations for the 75th Golden Globes. However, the film looks set to face strong opposition from Steven Spielberg’s Pentagon Papers drama The Post and Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, at a Globes ceremony that will provide the entertainment industry with its first major opportunity to respond to the sexual abuse scandal plaguing Hollywood. Two months after the emergence of allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein that would prompt a further torrent of claims against men in the film industry, the nominations exhibited an already changed landscape in Hollywood. As expected none of the Weinstein-produced films eligible for inclusion received nominations, however there were multiple nominations for Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World, which was forced to replace star Kevin Spacey at short notice, after he was accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and harassment. At the same time, the widely predicted shift towards a more female-focused list of nominees in the wake of the Weinstein scandal did not materialise. Though there were nods for a number of films with female protagonists, including The Shape of Water, Three Billboards, I, Tonya, a biopic of disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding and coming-of-age comedy-drama Lady Bird, there was no room in the nominees for any female directors, while Patty Jenkins’s feminist superhero movie Wonder Woman was snubbed entirely. Leading the way with seven nominations is the Shape of Water, which stars British actor Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaner at a governmental research facility who falls in love with a captured sea creature. Both Del Toro and Hawkins have been nominated in the drama category, for best director and best actress respectively, while Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer have received supporting actor and actress nominations. The film has also received best screenplay and score nominations, as well as best picture in the drama category. It is joined in that latter category by 70s-set drama The Post, which stars Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep as Washington Post higher-ups who clash over whether to publish classified documents about the war in Vietnam.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"SECTION 1\n\nTo uncover some of the mysteries surrounding creativity, a visit to an art classroom in Denver, Colorado is recommended. Here, a teacher assigns her class the task of replicating the distinctive style of the renowned Russian artist Vassily Kandinsky. The pupils engage in mimicking Kandinsky's geometric shapes and experiment with brush techniques while absorbing color theories. However, if the lesson stopped there, it would merely serve as a practical study in art history. The instructor goes a step further, instructing her students to dismantle their paintings and construct three-dimensional sculptures from the fragments. \n\nDespite starting from the same point, the students' creations exhibit vast differences - some take the form of vertical columns, while others present themselves as tangled webs of varied shapes and angles. Through this exercise, the students are taught that the past is not an endpoint but rather a springboard for innovative thinking. Creativity doesn't arise spontaneously; instead, it is derived and developed from what already exists. Not a single idea is purely original; each new concept is anchored in the knowledge or artworks that came before it.\n\nNow revisited the process of understanding creativity, it starts by acknowledging that creativity emerges from a deeper comprehension of existing concepts and ideas. The art classroom in Denver provides an excellent example of this, as students begin by imitating the style of Vassily Kandinsky. This initial phase allows the students to gain a fundamental understanding of the techniques that form the basis of Kandinsky's artworks, such as his geometric abstractions and the use of color theories. \n\nBy engaging in the replicas of Kandinsky's style, students not only start to grasp past concepts but also lay the groundwork for their innovative transformations. The next step in nurturing creativity takes place when the teacher introduces the exercise of cutting their paintings into smaller pieces and using them to construct 3D sculptures. This activity challenges the students to think outside the boundaries of their current understanding and consider new possibilities for their artworks. The students' willingness to explore these new territories demonstrates their ability to evolve their creative thought processes, transitioning from mere imitators to true creators.\n\nSECTION 2\n\nThe process of creativity can be observed in the art classroom exercise when students start with the same source and end up with a variety of unique outcomes. These diverse works show how creativity doesn't emerge from a vacuum but instead is a collaboration of existing ideas and new perspectives. By encouraging students to build upon Kandinsky's style and create new forms from the remnants, the teacher illustrates the importance of using the past as a foundation for future innovation.\n\nMoreover, this classroom exercise provides valuable insights into fostering creativity in learners. By starting with a specific style or concept, students can refine their understanding of the underlying principles and build a strong foundation. Then, by challenging them to create their unique interpretations of the original source, teachers can help unlock their creativity and push the boundaries of conventional thinking.\n\nIn conclusion, creativity can be nurtured through a combination of understanding existing concepts and challenging oneself to think differently. This is demonstrated in the example of the Denver art classroom, where students start with the principles of geometric abstraction and then transform their knowledge into innovative and diverse 3D sculptures. In this way, creativity is not solely an abstract concept but a tangible process that can be developed, taught, and honed through hands-on learning experiences.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In her essays, Susan Sontag spoke with one of the great, sure voices of the last century. From her salon at the centre of the cosmopolis, marvellously at one with her books and her learning, she considered, renamed and renewed our relationship with camp, with photography, with illness: a living legend of braininess and cool. Sontag, was not, though, as her editor Benjamin Taylor admits in the introduction to this gathering of stories from across her career, a committed short-story writer. She turned to the form in order to evade what Chekhov called “autobiographophobia”, which Taylor uses to mean the fear of writing and reflecting directly about one’s life. Evading this fear, Sontag clearly found the name “stories” very helpful: half of them are pure autobiography. “Pilgrimage”, for example, which opens the volume, is a memoir of Sontag’s youth in southern California, and an account of her visit with a boyfriend to the home of an ageing Thomas Mann. The only reason why this did not become an essay, it seems, is that the encounter was dull and disappointing, and so difficult to reflect on: Mann had “only sententious formulas to deliver. And I uttered nothing but tongue-tied simplicities, though I was full of complex feeling. We were neither of us at our best.” The next piece, “Project for a Trip to China”, is also memoir: we learn more about Sontag’s childhood (she was a voracious reader and dug deep holes in the garden to sit in); about her habit of ordering ambitiously in restaurants (hundred-year-old eggs); and a little about her father, who worked in China. The piece is more experimental, using lists and tables, characters identified by initials only, and lots of negatives (she does not, predictably, go to China).\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In her essays, Susan Sontag spoke with one of the great, sure voices of the last century. From her salon at the centre of the cosmopolis, marvellously at one with her books and her learning, she considered, renamed and renewed our relationship with camp, with photography, with illness: a living legend of braininess and cool. Sontag, was not, though, as her editor Benjamin Taylor admits in the introduction to this gathering of stories from across her career, a committed short-story writer. She turned to the form in order to evade what Chekhov called “autobiographophobia”, which Taylor uses to mean the fear of writing and reflecting directly about one’s life. Evading this fear, Sontag clearly found the name “stories” very helpful: half of them are pure autobiography. “Pilgrimage”, for example, which opens the volume, is a memoir of Sontag’s youth in southern California, and an account of her visit with a boyfriend to the home of an ageing Thomas Mann. The only reason why this did not become an essay, it seems, is that the encounter was dull and disappointing, and so difficult to reflect on: Mann had “only sententious formulas to deliver. And I uttered nothing but tongue-tied simplicities, though I was full of complex feeling. We were neither of us at our best.” The next piece, “Project for a Trip to China”, is also memoir: we learn more about Sontag’s childhood (she was a voracious reader and dug deep holes in the garden to sit in); about her habit of ordering ambitiously in restaurants (hundred-year-old eggs); and a little about her father, who worked in China. The piece is more experimental, using lists and tables, characters identified by initials only, and lots of negatives (she does not, predictably, go to China).\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Answer with at least 181 words. Your response should contain at least 14 sentences. Your answer must contain exactly 2 bullet points. Use the markdown bullet points such as:\n* This is point 1. \n* This is point 2 Do not include keywords ['pool', 'sir', 'site', 'tip', 'weakness'] in the response.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n To non-vegans, the idea of a plant-based Christmas dinner may smack of Scrooge crouched over a miserly candle, sucking on a single slice of tofu. There are few holidays more dedicated to tearing up the five-a-day-guidelines than this one, so if you take away not only the meat but the cream, then what’s left? Actually, this year there’s a lot left, as supermarkets are increasingly wise to the idea that plenty of vegans want to stuff their faces, too. With estimates that between 2 and 12% of British people now follow a vegetarian diet, it’s unsurprising that a vegetarian Christmas is well catered for by shops, but the rise of the “flexitarian” means that even non-vegans may buy and try vegan now, if it’s an option. It takes a bit of supermarket-hopping and a familiarity with an online checkout to do it, but with a little effort, there’s now a gluttonous array of choice. Christmas dinner is a roast with bits added on, and the majority of a roast is vegan anyway. There are a few tweaks that may need to be made – use oil to roast the potatoes instead of fat; swap butter for olive oil in the mash, and leave honey off the parsnips and carrots (you could swap in maple or agave syrup for sweetness). When it comes to the star of the show, the amount of effort you’re willing to put in will dictate your centrepiece. The ever-reliable Linda McCartney range’s new “roast beef” joint comes with a boozy-tasting red wine glaze and a remarkably beef-like flavour, which is great for vegans who like the taste of meat but not the methods, though it may be too meaty for some. Fry’s soy and quinoa Country Roast is a solid herby veggie roast, while Tofurky’s turkey and stuffing is a respectable substitute for the real thing.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

It should also address the mixture of history, literature, travel, digression, detective work, and humor found within the book.\n\nThe second paragraph will discuss the structure of the book. It mentions that 12 out of the 16 chapters focus on specific locations across Europe and Asia, from Baku (Azerbaijan) to Cornwall, covering a broad geographical range.\n\nThe third paragraph should draw attention to Davies' themes and his object, to observe recurring themes and fleeting details, and refer to the inclusion of marginalisation of indigenous peoples in Tasmania as an example. \n\nIn the fourth paragraph, the focus is on Davies’ fascination with languages. He utilises different linguistic components in the narrative: Chinese characters and Japanese kanji to discuss toponyms in East Asian countries, a section on Tahitian nature words that hints towards Davies’ extensive interest in languages.\n\nFinally, the last paragraph is required to start with 'Wall' and continue on the glossary of Australian slang that Davies includes in his book. The diffusion of languages shows the encyclopedic interest of Davies, capturing the essence of various linguistic expressions within the regions he examines.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n<<Travels and Reflections: A Fragrant Stew of History, Literature, and Travel>>\n\nHistorian Norman Davies, near the conclusion of his captivating book, reflects on his extensive travels and the freedom they granted him to ruminate on a subject he has dedicated his life to mastering. Through the journeys described in these pages, Davies presents a rich fusion of history, literature, travel, digressions, detective work, and humor, all of which weave together to form a vivid tapestry.\n\nDavies' book is composed of sixteen chapters in total. Twelve of these are centered on specific places he visited, spanning from Baku in Azerbaijan, where Asia and Europe meet, to the English county of Cornwall. The remaining four chapters delve into thematic areas, such as cultural and linguistic insights.\n\nOne of Davies' primary objectives was to improve his observational abilities, identifying recurring themes and capturing noteworthy details. For instance, a particularly gripping section of the book presents a chronicle of the fascinating yet often marginalized first inhabitants of Tasmania. This demonstrates Davies' emphasis on history and indigenous peoples' experiences.\n\nDavies also demonstrates a keen interest in linguistic revival and the diversity of languages. Employing Chinese characters and Japanese kanji, he discusses the topographical nomenclature of these countries. An intriguing section within the book highlights Tahitian nature words, revealing Davies' deep appreciation for various linguistic expressions.\n\nWall,\nDavies' book concludes with a glossary of \"Strine,\" the colloquial term for Australian English. This inclusion further underlines the historian's comprehensive approach to languages and cultures, effectively capturing the essence of many diverse linguistic expressions found within the regions he has explored. <|end_of_solution|>",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The rather unexpected allusion by the prime minister this week in a speech to the Business Council of Australia to the government’s pursuit of further income tax cuts is not one that should be treated with too much respect until he also talks about how to pay for them. With the return to surplus built on income tax revenue, any income tax cuts are unlikely to come before the next decade without either increases in other taxes or big cuts to government services. Amid the usual “free markets are great” rah-rah that the prime minister doled out to the Business Council of Australia on Monday night, Malcolm Turnbull also slipped in a line on income tax cuts, noting that he was: “Actively working with the treasurer and all my cabinet colleagues to ease the burden on middle-income Australians, while also meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” This was a bit of a surprise given the current state of the budget is such that the government is projecting that a return to surplus only in 2020-21and that net debt at that point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP. Even in the best of times, promising income tax cuts as the budget is in deficit is a courageous position to take for a political party that likes to prides itself on “budget responsibility”.It is even more courageous when the path back to surplus is built on a foundation of income tax revenue. Individual’s income tax has always been the biggest tax in the budget. During the mining-boom years it declined slightly in importance as company tax exploded in value from 3.3% of GDP in 1998-99 to5.3% of GDP in 2005-06. But in the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for just over half of all tax revenue. Now that in itself is a bit of a problem (the IMF and OECD have made calls for Australia to lessen its reliance on income tax) but it is a bigger problem for Turnbull and his call for tax cuts while also “meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” The issue it that of the extra $88.1bn in tax revenue the government hopes to gain between now and 2020-21, $48.5bn of it is to come from individual income tax. This means that income tax is actually bearing a greater burden of the increase in tax than would be expected. Income tax makes up 50.6% of total tax revenue, but accounts for 55% of the increase in tax revenue between now and 2020-21.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The subject can be approached by first understanding the key points in the given text which include: a surprising mention of potential income tax cuts from the Prime Minister; emphasis on balancing the budget's return to surplus and the need for clarification on funding these cuts; the reliance on income tax revenue for the budget; the current state of the budget returning to surplus only in 2020-21 with significant national debt; and the bigger financial pressure individual income tax faces. Keeping these points in consideration, a paraphrased version should reflect these concepts clearly and accurately. \n\nTo construct a paraphrased version, I will begin by identifying the main argument of the original text and capture the unexpected reference to tax cuts and the responsibility towards balancing the budget accurately. Second, the complexity of the situation will be expressed clearly, discussing both the current state of the budget and the potential difficulty in executing the promised tax cuts. The impact and reliance on individual income tax will be elaborately discussed in the subsequent paragraph. Finally, the current situation will be summarized, emphasizing the perceived complexity and challenge to achieve a budget surplus and tax cuts concurrently.\n\nTechnology has driven many changes in how governments operate and in how news is delivered. In the current day, even as digital platforms have created new entrants into news coverage, traditional channels are still some of the only trustworthy sources that remain largely objective and impartial where local or national political news and decisions are concerned. In this regard, the Guardian presents its readers with a critical outlook of the supposedly unexpected income tax cut talk by the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and evaluates its implication on citizens and overall fiscal responsibility. \n\nThe reference was seen as surprising given the noted budget deficit and previous emphasis on financial prudence by the ruling party. Tennis, records, and chance are great examples of things where nuances and unforeseen factors can lead to unexpected outcomes. In politics, especially regarding claims such as the one expressed by Malcolm Turnbull on Monday night, context and forward planning are key, and a common economic principle is an understanding that favorable expenditure involves clear revenue or resource sources. A declaration of imminent income tax cut without a specified method of resource allocation or compensatory measures can thus be misleading or taken out of context. It is also intriguing considering the government's recent efforts to balance the budget, which is expected to reach surplus only after 2020, with debt levels anticipated to soar to nearly 17.6% of GDP in 2021.\n\nUnderstanding the complexities of income tax revenue, we realize that it isn't merely a financial imposition but a complex intrinsically woven into our societal infrastructure. The keyword here is 'revenue,' which, by its very definition, underlines the reliance on income tax for any fiscal plan. Throughout recent years, individual income tax has stood as the financial pillar contributing the largest share of tax revenue. This depiction of tax reliance must thus be seen as a two-edged sword, signifying the necessity for rectification as suggested by notable global bodies – the IMF and OECD – while impacting current situations like potential tax cuts. The spotlight is significantly on individuals having to bear increasing financial loads, implying a steeper financial responsibility. \n\nIn conclusion, the authoritative article offers on-the-ground analysis, rendering an incisive understanding of the purported declaration of income tax relief. However, it also highlights significant financial challenges looming ahead. Malcolm Turnbull's aspirational announcement of tax cuts needs to be gauged with a dose of realism, considering the fiscal disciplinary context.

In the current day, even as digital platforms have created new entrants into news coverage, traditional channels are still some of the only trustworthy sources that remain largely objective and impartial where local or national political news and decisions are concerned. In this regard, the Guardian presents its readers with a critical outlook of the supposedly unexpected income tax cut talk by the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and evaluates its implication on citizens and overall fiscal responsibility. The reference was seen as surprising given the noted budget deficit and previous emphasis on financial prudence by the ruling party.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Olivia Mead, a millionaire heiress whose list of expenses included a $1.2m crystal-encrusted grand piano and $2,000 annual upkeep of her pet axolotl, has had her inheritance cut from $25m to $6.14m following an appeal from her deceased father’s estate. The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father’s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have “any involvement or association whatsoever” with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than “traditional” Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead’s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court’s master, Craig Sanderson, said would “not fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community”. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright’s estate, acting on behalf of Wright’s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later. On Wednesday, the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court set aside Sanderson’s orders, ruling that while Sanderson was correct to say that Mead had been inadequately provided for in the original will: “The exercise of his discretion to order that provision be made for the respondent in the sum of $25m was flawed.” In a lengthy written judgment, the court found that Sanderson made a number of “material errors” in calculating the size of Mead’s inheritance, saying the focus should have been on what constituted “proper maintenance” and that the initial finding that Mead was “honest” and “not a gold-digger” were not relevant. “The capital sum should be sufficient to enable the respondent to purchase a reasonably substantial house with part of the capital sum and to invest the balance so that she will receive a reasonably substantial annuity for the remainder of her life,” the appeal court’s president, Michael Buss, said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Lu Wei was the powerful and flamboyant head of the Cyberspace Administration of China from 2014 until June 2016 and he came to personify China’s model for internet control. He travelled to the United States, meeting with the CEOs of Facebook, Amazon and Apple, and held court when tech titans visited China.

With Queenslanders preparing to head to the polls on Saturday, no clear victor has emerged, leaving both the LNP and Labor scrambling to bed down seats. Labor has consolidated its message to one line – “a clear choice” – as it seeks to highlight what it says will be the “cuts and chaos” under a Tim Nicholls-led government. The LNP leader has said he is willing to work with One Nation in the event of a hung parliament. But the Labor campaign is reeling from the damage done by one of its own MPs, the former police minister Jo-Ann Miller, who sought out the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, in front of the media on Tuesday, embracing her and presenting her with a gift for her new grandson. Media at the event have reported that One Nation was aware of Miller’s intentions. Miller and Labor have maintained it was a coincidence of the campaign and a “common decency” to present a gift for a new baby. But the friendly meeting may have damaged Labor’s attempts to paint itself as standing apart from Hanson’s party, which is predicted to take seats across north and central Queensland, as well as some outer-urban electorates in the south-east. “The real issue here is what is going to happen in three days’ time, on Saturday,” Annastacia Palaszczuk said from Bundaberg on Wednesday, moments before her team attempted to keep her away from signs declaring: “It’ll be grim under Tim.” The placement of “grim” seemed a little too close for comfort for those focused on optics. “That is the real fundamental issue and it is about a choice, it is fundamentally about a clear choice,” she said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

This incident may weaken Labor's efforts to position itself distinctly from One Nation, which is forecasted to secure seats across various regions within Queensland. Annastacia Palaszczuk, appealing from Bundaberg, reiterated the importance of Saturday's polls, adhering closely to her party’s campaign mantra of presenting a clear dichotomy for Queensland voters.\n\nHallmarks of a contentious campaign are evident in Palaszczuk's attempt to avoid proximity to negative campaign signs bearing phrases such as “It’ll be grim under Tim,” just before speaking. Focused on visual impact, Labor’s team considered the placement of such signs, reflecting broader strategies employed in the final stretch which look to capitalize on maintaining positive optics amidst a tight race.\"",

At a gala dinner in Canberra on Tuesday, Rinehart gave the inaugural agricultural and related industries award to Joyce, describing him as a “champion of the industry”. Labor immediately took aim at the award, with the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, labelling it a “$40,000 cash present”. Joyce has said he will refuse the cash. The Nationals leader, a close personal friend of Rinehart and former agriculture and water minister, is currently battling for his political life in the New England byelection after the high court ruled him ineligible to sit in parliament because of dual New Zealand citizenship. Rinehart thanked Joyce for taking “time out of your campaigning schedule to come here – to be here for the industry you love and support”. “What a great voice for Australian agriculture,” she said. “The agricultural industry is fortunate to have had such a dedicated, understanding and enthusiastic minister – one with years of first-hand experience – a real Aussie country boy and boy, do we hope you return.” Footage of the event shows Joyce stood up to accept the award and giant cheque, before modestly exclaiming “hooley dooley – rightio”. In addition to being the chair of Hancock Prospecting, Rinehart has extensive agricultural holdings and is the part owner of the $386m S Kidman and Co cattle company which has leasehold over 80,000 sq km in Australia’s north. At a press conference on Wednesday, Shorten asked: “Why is a mining millionaire giving a Turnbull government minister a $40,000 cash present?\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

At a gala dinner in Canberra on Tuesday, Rinehart gave the inaugural agricultural and related industries award to Joyce, describing him as a “champion of the industry”. Labor immediately took aim at the award, with the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, labelling it a “$40,000 cash present”. Joyce has said he will refuse the cash.

Include keywords ['commission', 'crazy', 'food', 'split', 'white'] in the response.\n\nAustralia's wealthiest woman, Gina Rinehart, a prominent figure in the mining industry, has bestowed a 'commission' of $40,000 to Barnaby Joyce for his contributions to agriculture, a move that has been described by opposition leader Bill Shorten as looking 'crazy', akin to a 'white' elephant gift. The event took place at a grand dinner in Canberra, and Joyce, a staunch supporter of agriculture, has decided to turn down the hefty remuneration. The 'split' in perspectives on this 'award' is stark, with Labor viewing it as a suspicious 'cash present' and Joyce's agricultural community seeing it as a recognition for services to the sector. Rinehart, apart from her venture in mining, also has significant stakes in the agricultural business, including a share of the $386m food company, S Kidman and Co. This situation is stirring up a mix of emotions and reactions, making the politics around Joyce's New England by-election 'split' even more contentious.",
