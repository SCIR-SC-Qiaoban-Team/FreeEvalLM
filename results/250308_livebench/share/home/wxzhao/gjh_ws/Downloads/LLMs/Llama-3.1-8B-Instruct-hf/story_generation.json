      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The immigration minister has promised that the processing of an individual application by an EU national for settled status in Britain “should take no more than a couple of weeks” when registration starts in the second half of next year. The minister, Brandon Lewis, told the Commons home affairs select committee that an extra 1,200 UK visas and immigration staff were being recruited to process an expected 3.5m applications from EU nationals over two and a half years. He also told MPs on Tuesday that he was optimistic that an agreement could be struck by Christmas on the rights of EU citizens in the UK in the Brexit negotiations. However, he declined to comment on reports that the Brexit inner cabinet had decided on Monday that the European court of justice could continue to play a role in guaranteeing their rights during a two-year transition period. The Home Office minister did confirm that those refused “settled status” and classed as non-EU nationals in Britain illegally could have their bank accounts frozen and face deportation before the hearing of any appeal in British courts. The 3million group, representing EU nationals in Britain, immediately questioned Lewis’s claim that an agreement with the EU on “settled status” was likely before Christmas. “We wonder how. Major stumbling blocks still in place,” they tweeted, noting continued differences over the role of the ECJ, over family reunification rights that could affect thousands, and regarding clarification that they should not face “hostile environment measures”. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, voiced scepticism that an extra 1,200 staff – of whom 700 had already been recruited – would be sufficient when the UK Visas and Immigration agency (UKVI) currently used 6,500 staff to process 3m visa applications a year. There was already a three-month delay in processing EU nationals’ applications for permanent residence documents, she said.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n This is a bankrupt budget. Not in the strictly financial sense, though how much more threadbare core public services can become without collapsing and causing social mayhem the next few years will prove, if the government lasts. Even with faltering economic growth, public spending is to go on falling as a proportion of GDP. It’s bankrupt in ideas, in understanding, in preparedness to examine what has been happening to public services. Housing offers a glaring example. For all the bells and whistles in the budget, and some welcome augmentation of council powers, the government fails to make an obvious connexion. Building houses, allocating land, encouraging development, and policing the delinquency of private developers all imply an active and financially lubricated local government. Housing is and always will be about places, streets, brownfields – and public acceptance of schemes that will abut on their property or where they walk their dog. That’s what councillors do. Ace ideologue of the free market Oliver Letwin, of all people, can’t substitute.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n This is a bankrupt budget. Not in the strictly financial sense, though how much more threadbare core public services can become without collapsing and causing social mayhem the next few years will prove, if the government lasts. Even with faltering economic growth, public spending is to go on falling as a proportion of GDP. It’s bankrupt in ideas, in understanding, in preparedness to examine what has been happening to public services. Housing offers a glaring example. For all the bells and whistles in the budget, and some welcome augmentation of council powers, the government fails to make an obvious connexion. Building houses, allocating land, encouraging development, and policing the delinquency of private developers all imply an active and financially lubricated local government. Housing is and always will be about places, streets, brownfields – and public acceptance of schemes that will abut on their property or where they walk their dog. That’s what councillors do. Ace ideologue of the free market Oliver Letwin, of all people, can’t substitute.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Wrap your entire response with double quotation marks. Your answer must contain exactly 4 bullet points. Use the markdown bullet points such as:\n* This is point 1. \n* This is point 2 Finish your response with this exact phrase Any other questions?. No other words should follow this phrase.

Shot mostly on camera phones by the actors, #Starvecrow is a tiny-budget British drama about a group of insufferably privileged twentysomething mates.

After a two-and-a-half-year battle with brain cancer, he died peacefully this morning, November 22, surrounded by family near his home in London, UK. May the warmth of his voice and his spirit always be with us.” Hvorostovsky was born in a tough industrial city in Siberia, telling an interviewer in 2002 that as a high school student, prison looked a more likely destination than the opera stage, with “drinking, drugs and fighting,” part of his adolescence. A teenage obsession with pop music also almost claimed the singer for a different world, and his hard drinking and wild behaviour continued into his 20s and early 30s. He came to international attention in 1989 when he beat Bryn Terfel to win the Cardiff Singer of the World title. With his prematurely white hair, dashing good looks and powerful stage presence, his heartthrob image was carefully cultivated and he amassed legions of fans. A career performing in all the major opera houses and concert halls followed, and he was hailed one of the world’s greatest baritones for the rich, expressive fluidity of his voice. His fame allowed him to bring the neglected and little known Russian song repertoire into western halls, most notably with the remarkable accompanist Ivari Ilja. In the opera house he was particularly feted for his performances of Verdi, and also his charismatic and provocative interpretation of Tchaikovksy’s antihero Eugene Onegin, a role he made his own.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"**UK Budget: A Mixed Bag of Good News and Controversial Decisions**\n\nIn a budget aimed at boosting the economy and supporting key demographics, UK Chancellor Philip Hammond has announced a series of measures, including a £3bn Brexit preparation fund and significant changes to the housing market. While some of the decisions have been welcomed by critics, others have raised concerns about their potential impact.\n\n* **First-Time Buyers to Benefit from Stamp Duty Abolition**: The biggest giveaway in the budget is the abolition of stamp duty for first-time buyers on properties worth up to £300,000. This move is expected to benefit 80% of first-time buyers, with those spending between £300,000 and £500,000 set to save £5,000 in stamp duty. Critics, however, have expressed concerns that the measure may fuel a housing bubble by artificially increasing demand.\n\n* **Logistical Complications and Controversy Over Help-to-Buy Scheme and Railcard Extension**: The budget also extends the help-to-buy scheme to 2021, injecting an additional £10bn into a program that has been accused of contributing to rising house prices. The government has refused to reform the scheme, which has previously been criticized for distorting the housing market.

While some of the decisions have been welcomed by critics, others have raised concerns about their potential impact.\n\n* **First-Time Buyers to Benefit from Stamp Duty Abolition**: The biggest giveaway in the budget is the abolition of stamp duty for first-time buyers on properties worth up to £300,000. This move is expected to benefit 80% of first-time buyers, with those spending between £300,000 and £500,000 set to save £5,000 in stamp duty. Critics, however, have expressed concerns that the measure may fuel a housing bubble by artificially increasing demand.\n\n* **Logistical Complications and Controversy Over Help-to-Buy Scheme and Railcard Extension**: The budget also extends the help-to-buy scheme to 2021, injecting an additional £10bn into a program that has been accused of contributing to rising house prices. The government has refused to reform the scheme, which has previously been criticized for distorting the housing market. Meanwhile, the extension of the young people's railcard to under-31s has raised questions about how the plan will be implemented, with negotiations set to take place with rail companies to finalize the details.",

This national rerelease is linked to the Grahame retrospective at BFI Southbank, in London. It is adapted from the hardboiled thriller by Dorothy B Hughes, changing her story and rehabilitating the male lead in one way, but in another, introducing a new strain of pessimism and defeat.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Philip Hammond must borrow an extra £90bn over the next five years after the Treasury’s independent forecaster downgraded productivity growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that the chancellor faced a long period of lower than expected wages growth that would dent tax receipts and push up borrowing. The cumulative effect over the life of the parliament would add £90.5bn to the UK’s debt pile and jeopardise Hammond’s target of balancing the government’s books by 2025, it said. The Treasury said that once the positive effects of an increase in employment and better than expected borrowing over the last year are taken into account, the net borrowing rise would be £35bn, putting the chancellor in a position to reach his target of creating a surplus in the middle of the next decade. But some analysts said the OBR’s revision failed to go far enough and it continued to overestimate the capacity of British businesses to invest in new equipment and processes to drive up productivity. They argued that the forecaster should have gone further and predicted that productivity growth – which measures the average output per hour worked – of almost zero over the last seven years would continue for another five years. Joanna Davies, a UK economist at Fathom Consulting, said the OBR’s new forecast that productivity would increase at a rate of 1.1% until 2022 – almost half the 2.1% average seen in the 30 years before 2007 – still looked ambitious. She said the prospects for GDP growth would suffer a severe knock-on effect from lower productivity and a rapidly ageing population. “Over the last five years, productivity growth has averaged just 0.3%,” she said. “Combined with UN projections for working-age population growth, the UK’s trend rate of overall economic growth is probably somewhere in the range 0.5%-1% – around half the 1.5% assumed by the OBR.” The OBR chair, Robert Chote, said GDP growth would not only be hit by lower productivity, but also a weaker than expected export sector that would fail to benefit significantly from the lower pound.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Here’s an album that feels beautifully out of season. Norwegian composer\/experimental guitarist Kim Myhr is a master of slow-morphing rhythms and sun-dappled textures that seem to glow from the inside. His electronics are mellow and inviting; his 12-string acoustic guitar has a loose, blissed-out twang. With just two long tracks (A and B on the vinyl release) that loop and shimmy around a single simple hook, You | Me has a 60s psych-folk vibe and something of the roving thrum of early Steve Reich or Terry Riley’s In C, or indeed Julius Eastman’s joyous Femenine. Three drummers – Ingar Zach, Hans Hulbækmo and The Necks’ Tony Buck – add spangling commentary and tranquil momentum and occasionally drift into sombre eddies. It’s an album to bolster the spirits and ground the nerves: travelling music for big-sky vistas.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  At the end of your response, please explicitly add a postscript starting with P.S. Your response must have 2 sections.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Here’s an album that feels beautifully out of season. Norwegian composer\/experimental guitarist Kim Myhr is a master of slow-morphing rhythms and sun-dappled textures that seem to glow from the inside. His electronics are mellow and inviting; his 12-string acoustic guitar has a loose, blissed-out twang. With just two long tracks (A and B on the vinyl release) that loop and shimmy around a single simple hook, You | Me has a 60s psych-folk vibe and something of the roving thrum of early Steve Reich or Terry Riley’s In C, or indeed Julius Eastman’s joyous Femenine. Three drummers – Ingar Zach, Hans Hulbækmo and The Necks’ Tony Buck – add spangling commentary and tranquil momentum and occasionally drift into sombre eddies. It’s an album to bolster the spirits and ground the nerves: travelling music for big-sky vistas.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  At the end of your response, please explicitly add a postscript starting with P.S. Your response must have 2 sections. Mark the beginning of each section with Section X, such as:\nSection 1\n[content of section 1]\nSection 2\n[content of section 2]",
    "response":"Section 1\n\nKim Myhr's latest album, You | Me, is a mesmerizing soundscape that defies the conventions of traditional music. As a Norwegian composer and experimental guitarist, Myhr has spent years honing his craft, crafting rhythms and textures that seem to morph and evolve at their own pace. His use of electronics creates a warm and inviting atmosphere, drawing the listener in with an irresistible force. When paired with his 12-string acoustic guitar, the results are nothing short of magical, conjuring up images of sun-dappled landscapes and boundless skies.\n\nThe album's structure is simplicity itself, with just two long tracks (A and B, for vinyl enthusiasts) that flow seamlessly into one another. This deliberate pacing creates a hypnotic effect, as the listener becomes lost in the gently unfolding melodies and rhythms. Myhr's influences are evident throughout, with nods to the likes of Steve Reich, Terry Riley, and Julius Eastman. Yet, despite these nods to the past, You | Me feels uniquely contemporary, a living and breathing entity that refuses to be pinned down by genre or category.\n\nThe addition of three drummers – Ingar Zach, Hans Hulbækmo, and The Necks' Tony Buck – adds a further layer of depth and complexity to the music. Their subtle interplay adds a sense of fluidity and spontaneity, while also providing a grounding force that keeps the listener tethered to the earth. As the music builds and ebbs, the drummers drift in and out of the picture, creating a sense of dynamic movement and tension. It's a delicate balance, but one that Myhr and his bandmates achieve with ease.\n\nWhen you listen to You | Me, it's hard not to feel a sense of liberation wash over you. The music is like a adventure, a journey through the uncharted territories of the human experience. With its soaring melodies and driving rhythms, it's an album that feels made for the great outdoors – for road trips, hiking excursions, and long, aimless drives through the desert. It's music for the big sky, the kind of music that makes you feel small yet connected to the world around you.\n\nSection 2\n\nAs the album reaches its climax, the music swells and surges, building towards a final, triumphant release. It's a moment of pure catharsis, one that leaves the listener breathless and wanting more. And yet, even as the music fades away, the sense of calm and clarity remains, a lingering echo that haunts the listener long after the album has ended.\n\nYou | Me is an album for anyone who's ever felt disillusioned by the fast-paced, high-stakes world we live in. It's a reminder that there's beauty in simplicity, that sometimes the most profound experiences can be found in the quiet, still moments between the chaos and the noise. Whether you're someone who travels frequently or just likes to escape into your own world, this album has the power to transport you to a place of wonder and awe.\n\nKim Myhr's You | Me is a masterpiece, a work of art that defies genre and categorization. It's an album that will appeal to fans of everything from ambient electronica to 60s psych-folk, but ultimately transcends those labels to become something truly unique and original. It's a testament to the power of music to soothe the soul and calm the nerves, an invitation to explore the vast and uncharted territories of the human experience.\n\nP.S. Kim Myhr's You | Me is available now on vinyl and digital platforms. For more information, please visit the artist's website or social media channels.",

    "response":"The majestic collection of music known as \"moral and spiritual forest\" stands as a testament to the masterful composition of Claudio Monteverdi. This iconic work of the Baroque period not only represents the culmination of Monteverdi's illustrious career as maestro di cappella at St Mark's Basilica in Venice but also showcases the breathtaking acoustics of the venue. The sounds reverberating within its ancient walls, combined with an instrumental band and a 40-piece choir, create a sonic experience that is truly unparalleled.\n\nMonteverdi's \"moral and spiritual forest\" is a far-reaching musical tapestry that seamlessly weaves together grand ensembles and intimate solo confessionals. This complex composition calls for the highest level of musicianship and attention to detail from all involved. Yet, when it comes to capturing the essence of this masterpiece, some recordings are more suited to the task than others. According to critics, the new recording of \"moral and spiritual forest\" by conductor Pablo Heras-Casado and the Balthasar Neumann ensemble falls into the latter category.\n\nOne of the primary criticisms of the recording is that conductor Pablo Heras-Casado has a tendency to overly shape and control the music, smoothing out its rough edges. Monteverdi's composition is quintessentially about exploring the boundaries of sound and evoking a sense of the spontaneous. When the music becomes too polished and refined, it loses the essence of its raw emotion and vulnerability. Music aficionados argue that a more flexible and organic approach would better capture the true essence of Monteverdi's work.\n\nHowever, despite the shortcomings in their rendition of the larger ensembles, individual musicians and singers within the Balthasar Neumann ensemble truly excel. The pair of sopranos, Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner, deliver a heart-stopping performance in their rendition of the Salve Regina. Their agile voices weave together in perfect harmony, adding a level of intimacy and emotional depth to the music that redresses the balance somewhat.\n\nUltimately, \"moral and spiritual forest\" remains a true masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences with its profound beauty and emotional resonance. Whether or not the new recording by the Balthasar Neumann ensemble fully does justice to Monteverdi's composition is open to interpretation. Nevertheless, the raw talent and musicality on display from individual performers within the ensemble makes this a recording worth exploring for music lovers. ***",

A dead cert for admirers of Garbarek’s and Tord Gustavsen’s music, but the sources, vision and seriousness here are all Honing’s own.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"In a beautiful display of musical mastery, Dutch saxophonist Yuri Honing has created a seven-part suite that showcases his impressive range and experience as a composer and a musician. The suite, dedicated to European integration, is a testament to Honing's ability to weave complex ideas and inspirations into exquisite melodies.\n\nAs a seasoned professional, Honing has had the privilege of working with some of the greats in the jazz world, including Misha Mengelberg and Paul Bley, who both left an indelible mark on the global music scene. These experiences have not only shaped Honing's signature sound but also informed his eclectic approach to music, which incorporates influences from classical music, dance, and even politics.\n\nThe suite is a masterful blend of piano, bass, and drums, each instrument adding a unique texture to the rich soundscapes created by Honing's saxophone. Pianists and music enthusiasts will particularly appreciate the way Wolfert Brederode expertly complements Honing's solos, subtly shifting the dynamics of the music and creating a profound sense of intimacy.\n\nBassist Gulli Gudmundsson and drummer Joost Lijbaart, who have collaborated with Honing on numerous projects over the years, bring their distinctive voices to the music, while remaining mindful of the overall vision. This is evident in the way they seamlessly navigate the tension between the melodic lines and the rhythmic drive, creating a sense of depth and dimensionality that draws listeners in.\n\nFrom the sweepingly melancholic Part I to the wistful, cinematic quality of Part II, and the intense, operatic majesty of Part IV, Honing's suite defies categorization. Inspired by classical music giants like Wagner and Richard Strauss, this work is a testament to his boundless creativity and intellectual curiosity.\n\nDespite its apparent complacency, the music is bursting with hidden spontaneity, and its quiet introspection is tempered by moments of unexpected tension and release. True fans of Jan Garbarek and Tord Gustavsen will undoubtedly find much to appreciate in Honing's work, but it's clear that this is a true original, unencumbered by self-doubt or mercenary impulses.\n\nUltimately, Honing's suite stands as a shining testament to the power of music to delight, disturb, and uplift us. With every note and every subtle shading, it reminds us of the rich tapestry that exists between creativity and experience, and the countless ways in which we can respond to and engage with the world around us.\n\nAny other questions?",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Google has confirmed it has been able to track the location of Android users via the addresses of local mobile phone masts, even when location services were turned off and the sim cards removed to protect privacy. Revealed by a report by Quartz, Google’s Android system, which handles messaging services to ensure delivery of push notifications, began requesting the unique addresses of mobile phone masts (called Cell ID) at the beginning of 2017. The information was captured by the phone and routinely sent to Google by any modern Android device, even when location services were turned off and the sim card was removed. As a result Google could in theory track the location of the Android device and therefore the user, despite a reasonable expectation of privacy. A Google spokesperson said: “In January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery. “However, we never incorporated Cell ID into our network sync system, so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated it to no longer request Cell ID.” Google requested the Cell ID alongside what is called the mobile country code and mobile network code, which identify the country and mobile phone operator that the smartphone is using. That data is used to ensure the phone stays properly connected to Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging system, which handles the delivery of messages and notifications to the smartphone. A persistent connection is required for the system to work, but instead of staying constantly connected, the phone pings Google’s servers at set intervals. The more pings, the greater the battery drain, so the data collected about the country and mobile networks is used to work out the the minimum number of pings required to stay connected without draining the battery – so called heartbeat analysis. The benefit of having the address of the mobile phone mast to ensure message service reliability is not clear, but through a process of triangulation – the same used to assist when a user is actively using location services – the position of the user can be revealed down to a roughly 400m radius at a minimum, and often much more accurately in urban areas.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Google has confirmed it has been able to track the location of Android users via the addresses of local mobile phone masts, even when location services were turned off and the sim cards removed to protect privacy. Revealed by a report by Quartz, Google’s Android system, which handles messaging services to ensure delivery of push notifications, began requesting the unique addresses of mobile phone masts (called Cell ID) at the beginning of 2017. The information was captured by the phone and routinely sent to Google by any modern Android device, even when location services were turned off and the sim card was removed. As a result Google could in theory track the location of the Android device and therefore the user, despite a reasonable expectation of privacy. A Google spokesperson said: “In January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery. “However, we never incorporated Cell ID into our network sync system, so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated it to no longer request Cell ID.” Google requested the Cell ID alongside what is called the mobile country code and mobile network code, which identify the country and mobile phone operator that the smartphone is using. That data is used to ensure the phone stays properly connected to Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging system, which handles the delivery of messages and notifications to the smartphone. A persistent connection is required for the system to work, but instead of staying constantly connected, the phone pings Google’s servers at set intervals. The more pings, the greater the battery drain, so the data collected about the country and mobile networks is used to work out the the minimum number of pings required to stay connected without draining the battery – so called heartbeat analysis. The benefit of having the address of the mobile phone mast to ensure message service reliability is not clear, but through a process of triangulation – the same used to assist when a user is actively using location services – the position of the user can be revealed down to a roughly 400m radius at a minimum, and often much more accurately in urban areas.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Emmanuelle Riva, the lead actress, sat in stunned silence, her eyes fixed on the screen as she reflected on her final screen appearance. The Biarritz film festival, where the movie had premiered, continued to buzz with excitement, but for Riva, the evening marked the beginning of a new chapter in her life.\n\nSection 2\nGilberte, written and directed by French writer-directors Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon, was a warm and whimsical film that drew from the great traditions of French cinema. Riva's portrayal of Marthe, a free-spirited elderly woman, showcased her unparalleled talent for playing the roles of those who lived life with a sense of abandon and contentment. As she embarked on a journey of self-discovery with a charming tramp named Dom, the metaphor of a fire crackling in her heart mirrored the spirit that had long defined Riva's own life – a passion for art, and a love for the beauty in simple things.\n\nSection 3\nThe meeting between Riva and Pierce Richard, a veteran comedic actor from France, would go down in history as one of the most unforgettable on-screen cameo appearances of all time. \"Je t'aime, je me t'adore, mais je dois partir,\" Pierre Richard whispered in Riva's ear as they shared a tender moment in the rain. The spectator's heart melted, and the young audience in the cinema erupted into applause, waving their scarves in appreciation. Abel and Gordon's screenplay had captured the essence of the Parisian society: fiery, charismatic, and fragile.\n\nSection 4\nThe stage at the Biarritz film festival came alive as Abel and Gordon took to the microphone to receive an honorary award for their mastery of the Art of Laughter.

They cast off expectations, shining like a wheel on the wheel, standing resolute against the commotion, all of them adding adequate light to renew life. The audience applauded wildly, underlining the film's statement that genuine connection lies in authentic performances and devotedness.\n\nSection 5\nToday as Emmanuelle Riva was being laid to rest, memories flooded back of her engaging onscreen presence.

The news that wind operations would soon be a matter of public records sent shockwaves through the racing community, with many trainers and owners taking to social media to express their discontent. \nSome trainers couldn't help but seem less than enthusiastic about the prospect of transparency, with several shots fired at punters who seemed oblivious to the fact that wind ops did not always magically improve a horse's performance. But for Chris, the reaction was a clear indication that some trainers were struggling to grasp a fundamental concept - that of competition in the betting market.\n\n\"It's not a magic formula,\" Chris said during an interview. \"If trainers think that sharing information about wind ops will somehow give us the upper hand, they're misinformed. In fact, it's likely that the opposite will be true. When we have access to this information, we can make more informed decisions and factor it into our bets.\"\n\nOne such trainer, disenchanted with the new policy, was persuaded by Chris to speak on the record. \"I don't understand why they're making a big deal out of this,\" he said. \"We're just trying to keep our horses competitive, not trying to deceive anyone.

The key is to keep an open mind and not get caught up in the emotions of the game.\"\n\nFor Chris, this was just another step towards a more open and honest sport, where knowledge was power, not something to be hoarded.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theatre can sometimes jolt the memory. At a time when Ukraine has fallen off the media radar, this play by Natal’ya Vorozhbit, translated by Sasha Dugdale, provides a powerful reminder of the bitterness of the war that led to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. In particular, it makes the point that women attracted by the dubious glamour of the military can also become casualties of the conflict. The play consists of six vignettes of violence. The first is far and away the best.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theatre can sometimes jolt the memory. At a time when Ukraine has fallen off the media radar, this play by Natal’ya Vorozhbit, translated by Sasha Dugdale, provides a powerful reminder of the bitterness of the war that led to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. In particular, it makes the point that women attracted by the dubious glamour of the military can also become casualties of the conflict. The play consists of six vignettes of violence. The first is far and away the best.

    "response":"The dimly lit room of the theatre fell silent as Natal’ya Vorozhbit's powerful play began to unfold. The stage was set for a reminiscence of the bitter war that led to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Natal’ya, the Kiev-based writer, stepped forward, her voice trembling as she began to recount her story.\n\nIt was a year after the siege of Donetsk airport when she embarked on a research trip to the battle zone. The memories still lingered in her mind like an open wound. It was on that trip that she met her patriotic escort, a man named Sergei, whose rugged charm was only a facade for the horrors he had witnessed. As Natal’ya reminisced, the audience was transported to the midst of the conflict, where the propaganda machine masked the reality of war.\n\nSergei was a hero, or so he had been portrayed. But as the days passed, Natal’ya began to see beyond the façade, to the man who had lost love and family to the conflict. His eyes, once bright and full of determination, now seemed to hold a deep sense of loss and regret. It was in those moments that Natal’ya found herself drawn to him, her heart aching for the comfort he offered.\n\nBut as the days turned into weeks, Natal’ya realized that her feelings were not just about the war, but also about the freedom and independence that war seemed to bring. The promiscuous and fleeting relationships she had with the soldiers, the laughter and tears that followed, had made her question her own identity.\n\nIn the end, it was not the heroism of the soldiers that stayed with her, but the ordinary men and women who had been broken by the conflict. The women who had been sold false promises of romance and adventure, only to find themselves trapped in a cycle of violence and despair. It was a realization that would haunt her for the rest of her life, a constant reminder of the human cost of war.\n\nThe play ended with Natal’ya alone on stage, her voice barely above a whisper as she recited the words of a poet: \"In the end, it's not the bombs that are the problem, but the silence that follows.\" The audience sat in stunned silence, the play's powerful message lingering in the air like a ghost.\n\n******\n\nNatal’ya Vorozhbit's play was a raw and unflinching portrayal of the conflict that had ravaged Ukraine. The six vignettes of violence that made up the play were a stark reminder of the human cost of war, and the women who had been left to pick up the pieces.\n\nIn the first vignette, Natal’ya, the Kiev-based writer, recounted her story of a research trip to the battle zone. It was a year after the siege of Donetsk airport when she had arrived, her heart heavy with the weight of the conflict. But it was also on that trip that she had met Sergei, her patriotic escort, and found herself drawn to him in ways she could not understand.\n\nThe other vignettes were just as powerful, and just as disturbing. There was the teenage girl who had eagerly awaited the soldiers, only to find herself lost and alone in a sea of shattered lives. There was the female medic who had transported her lover's headless corpse, her heart heavy with the weight of her loss. And there was the young journalist who had outwitted her captor, her spirit unbroken despite the horrors she had witnessed.\n\nBut as the play reached its climax, Natal’ya began to question the morality of the conflict. The soldiers, they argued, were heroes, but what of the women who had been left to pick up the pieces? What of the civilians who had been caught in the crossfire? And what of the soldiers themselves, who had been driven by a sense of duty and patriotism, but who had ultimately found themselves trapped in a cycle of violence and despair?\n\nIt was a powerful and thought-provoking question, one that lingered long after the play had ended. The conflict in Ukraine had been a complex and multifaceted one, driven by a multitude of factors and motivations. But as Natal’ya Vorozhbit's play so powerfully illustrated, it was the human cost of war that had been the greatest tragedy of all.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Science is littered with tales of visionaries who paid for pioneering research to prove their theories, and this weekend “Mad” Mike Hughes is hoping to join them. He plans to launch a homemade rocket in California as part of a bid to eventually prove that the Earth is flat. Hughes has spent $20,000 (£15,000) building the steam-powered rocket in his spare time, and will be livestreaming the launch over the internet. The self-described daredevil says he switched his focus to rockets after twice breaking his back doing stunt jumps in cars. “I don’t believe in science,” declared the 61-year-old. “I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air. But that’s not science, that’s just a formula.” The rocket, which Hughes aims to reach an altitude of 1,800ft (550 metres) over California, will be launched from the back of a converted motorhome purchased from Craigslist. It is sponsored by a flat Earth research group, and Hughes plans a subsequent trip to try and observe the flatness of the Earth for himself. Speaking about the risks of the flight, Hughes said: “It’s scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive.” Hughes’ website describes him as “the only man to design, build and launch himself in a rocket” – he previously flew in his own rocket in 2014, as this footage shows. Hughes has stated that once he lands at the weekend, he intends to announce that he is running for the governorship of California.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Surging levels of violence at an “unsafe” G4S-run youth jail have put staff in hospital and caused inmates to carry improvised weapons for their safety, inspectors have revealed. The damning inspection report into Oakhill secure training centre, near Milton Keynes, was published on Tuesday as MPs heard that ministers had ordered G4S to set up an external inquiry into abuse allegations at Brook House, the immigration removal centre at Gatwick, which is also run by the private security firm. The joint report by the prison inspectors, with Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission, into Oakhill in September and October – when the centre was near capacity, with 75 boys aged 14 to 17 – finds “no evidence that staff can adequately care and control this volume of young people”. The report rates the youth prison as “inadequate” and says there has been an increase in fights and assaults since the last inspection in January; it records 330 assaults between March and August this year alone, with assaults against staff increasing, including against newly recruited staff, and some so serious they have led to people being taken to hospital. “One manager said that young people are carrying improvised weapons because they do not feel safe. This inhibits some staff from intervening because of the fear of a weapon, and this in turn reinforces the view of young people that staff cannot protect them, thereby continuing the cycle,” the report says. The inspectors say that many of the recommendations from their January inspection have not been met and the centre has deteriorated in most respects, including to do with safety, care, education, resettlement and the “effectiveness of leaders and managers”. They say that unacceptable behaviour, including swearing, intimidation and vandalism, is not being challenged by staff. Oakhill’s newly appointed interim director, Lisette Saunders, said: “We take these findings very seriously. In the report Ofsted recognised that senior managers at Oakhill know what is required to bring the centre up to acceptable standards.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

In 2010, it was reported that tapes had been submitted to the courts of Gibson allegedly using racist language and threatening to kill Grigorieva. He is also alleged to have said she deserved a beating. In one of the most notorious incidents involving the actor and director, Gibson unleashed an antisemitic rant in 2006 against a police officer in Malibu, California, who had pulled him over for drunk driving.

He will say the time would come soon when the IoD may have to advise all of its members to be ready for no deal and urged the government to stop this outcome. “We know from our recent surveys that over half of you are already in the process of contingency planning,” Martin will say. “The number of businesses who have actually implemented these plans is currently low, around one in 10, but this will snowball if we don’t find out soon what is going to happen in March 2019. “It’s clear that the government has a small window of opportunity between now and the end of the first quarter of next year to secure a firm political agreement on transition. If we don’t have this commitment by the end of March, then business will come under pressure to implement contingency plans, even perhaps as far as relocating operations.” He will say companies supported the idea of a transitional period after March 2019 to help the UK and rest of the EU adjust to Brexit, but they needed to know that cross-border trade would effectively remain unchanged. Martin will say that businesses do not want to move to World Trade Organisation rules as it would be a “huge drop down from where we are now” but may soon have to start planning for that possibility. “WTO is not the simple option, it would involve massive complexity to adjust our customs procedures, and we would lose not just our level of access to the single market, but also potentially all of the trade and investment agreements we have with other countries through the EU,” he will say. “It’s not desirable, but it is possible.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Employment was climbing and measures of consumer and business confidence, which plummeted after the referendum, had bounced back.

Economy What we know: The UK economy expanded by 1.7% in 2016 but registered just 0.5% growth in the first half of this year. The pace has improved since the summer largely due to improving growth rates in Europe and the US, but the outlook remains weak.

However, their plans were sabotaged by a leak, which meant that the news of Dugdale's appearance on the show overshadowed Richard Leonard's victory in the leadership vote. \n\nThe leak was devastating for Dugdale, not just because it ruined her plan, but also because it led to a flurry of vitriolic attacks on her judgment.

Dugdale was given the opportunity to present her account of events when she returns to parliament, but in the meantime, she was left to face the wrath of the media and her own party membership. \n\nFor Dugdale, the experience has been a rollercoaster of emotions, from excitement and anticipation to disappointment and frustration. As she settles into life in the Australian jungle, alongside 11 other contestants, she must now navigate the fallout from her decision back home. Will she emerge from the jungle with a renewed sense of purpose and a battered reputation, or will the controversy surrounding her appearance on the show prove too much to overcome?\n\nOnly time will tell if Dugdale will be able to save her career, but one thing is certain: her decision to join I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here has put her in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. As the party gears up for a showdown with the judgy media and the outcome of the party, Kezia Dugdale must summon up all her strength and face the criticism head-on, in order to rebuild and find her place within the party once more. Much more is at stake here.\n\nAs Jenny Gilruth pointed out, in a statement to the press, the party, in a big way could benefit from spreading love and unity at this very critical point in their Party's history - showing that they could express rational support through - Dugdale's attempt to inspire self-aware behaviour and experience motivated public advice between offering compliments.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?.",

Much more is at stake here.\n\nAs Jenny Gilruth pointed out, in a statement to the press, the party, in a big way could benefit from spreading love and unity at this very critical point in their Party's history - showing that they could express rational support through - Dugdale's attempt to inspire self-aware behaviour and experience motivated public advice between offering compliments.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n An appeal against a ban on Silvio Berlusconi holding public office is to be heard by the European court of human rights, in a move that could potentially see Italy’s scandal-tainted former prime minister leading the country again. The hearing on Wednesday, six years after he was forced from office, follows his success at forging a winning coalition out of his centre-right Forza Italia and two far-right parties – the Northern League and Brothers of Italy – in regional elections in Sicily earlier this month. The outcome of the ballot on the southern Italian island was largely seen as a rehearsal for how things might play out in national elections, which must be held before May next year. It also marked the beginning of an authentic political comeback for the 81-year-old, despite being plagued by a tax fraud conviction, sex scandals and allegations of corruption. Considering the length of time it takes for the court to deliver a verdict, it is unlikely to come before the general elections. The current five-year term for the Italian government officially expires on 15 March, although the vote could be held as late as May. “I hope that the Strasbourg court will accept my appeal,” Berlusconi wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “But my role in the next electoral campaign is clear regardless: I will be in the field looking to take the centre-right into government.” The billionaire, who was forced to resign from his third term as prime minister in 2011 over claims he paid for sex with an underage sex worker, has hired top lawyers from London’s Doughty Street Chambers to fight his case. He was ejected from parliament and banned from running for office for six years in 2013 due to his tax fraud conviction. “We’ll have just 30 minutes to set out our argument, the same goes for the government,” Andrea Saccucci, one of the lawyers who will represent Berlusconi in the Strasbourg court, told the Guardian.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

In a precedent-setting ruling that will echo across the EU, the European court of justice ordered Poland to show it was acting lawfully in the ancient woodland, or face a €36.5m (£32m) annual penalty. Agata Szafraniuk, a lawyer for the green law firm ClientEarth, said that the court was acting after Poland’s environment minister, Jan Szyszko, showed “complete contempt” for an earlier emergency ban on logging in the ancient woodland. “Financial penalties are, unfortunately, an essential tool to ensure that the best-preserved primeval forest in Europe is protected from further harm,” she said. “Trees are still being cut down every day, so the court prescribed this measure to guarantee the full protection of this unique forest, and to avoid irreparable damage.” The court move will ratchet up pressure on Poland, which is already facing a suspension of its EU Council voting rights over a clampdown on the country’s independent press and judiciary. Women’s groups have also been targeted for police raids, and rights to protest have been curtailed, adding to concerns about the rule of law in the east European country. Donald Tusk, the EU Council president, condemned Poland’s nationalist-right Law and Justice party government on Sunday, suggesting it was following the “Kremlin’s plan”.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The UK, even today, is not well blessed with festivals devoted to new music. But when the Huddersfield contemporary music festival began, in 1978, the situation was much worse, with no annual showcase here for what living composers were producing. That such an event took root in an unprepossessing West Yorkshire industrial town in the late 70s was remarkable in itself, especially when most of the activity in new music then was centred on London. What began on a modest scale under the aegis of Huddersfield Polytechnic (now the University of Huddersfield) – where the festival’s tireless founding director, Richard Steinitz, was a lecturer in music – grew quickly into one of the most important dates in the British musical calendar. The HCMF really hit its stride in the early 80s, hosting a series of important premieres alongside residencies from many of the senior figures of postwar music, from Olivier Messiaen and Terry Riley to Hans Werner Henze and Elliott Carter. Gradually expanding its ambition and range, Steinitz’s programming was never narrowly doctrinal; from the early days, he tried to reflect the spectrum of what was going on across Europe and the US. Steinitz stood down as director after the 2000 festival. The current director, Graham McKenzie, has been there for more than a decade, not only steering the programming towards new generations of composers from across Europe, but also broadening the stylistic scope, including events that touch on jazz, electronica and rock. With these changes, so the atmosphere of the festival has altered. This is partly because the generation of postwar composers whose appearances made the early festivals so memorable has all but gone, but also because, in those days, festival audiences had a sense of a shared purpose.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

But when the Huddersfield contemporary music festival began, in 1978, the situation was much worse, with no annual showcase here for what living composers were producing. That such an event took root in an unprepossessing West Yorkshire industrial town in the late 70s was remarkable in itself, especially when most of the activity in new music then was centred on London. What began on a modest scale under the aegis of Huddersfield Polytechnic (now the University of Huddersfield) – where the festival’s tireless founding director, Richard Steinitz, was a lecturer in music – grew quickly into one of the most important dates in the British musical calendar. The HCMF really hit its stride in the early 80s, hosting a series of important premieres alongside residencies from many of the senior figures of postwar music, from Olivier Messiaen and Terry Riley to Hans Werner Henze and Elliott Carter. Gradually expanding its ambition and range, Steinitz’s programming was never narrowly doctrinal; from the early days, he tried to reflect the spectrum of what was going on across Europe and the US. Steinitz stood down as director after the 2000 festival. The current director, Graham McKenzie, has been there for more than a decade, not only steering the programming towards new generations of composers from across Europe, but also broadening the stylistic scope, including events that touch on jazz, electronica and rock. With these changes, so the atmosphere of the festival has altered. This is partly because the generation of postwar composers whose appearances made the early festivals so memorable has all but gone, but also because, in those days, festival audiences had a sense of a shared purpose.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had provisionally found that Concordia had “abused its dominant position to overcharge the NHS” by hiking the price of liothyronine, used to treat patients with an underactive thyroid, by nearly 6,000% between 2007 and 2017. The regulator said the NHS had spent more than £34m on the drug last year, up from about £600,000 in 2006. The amount it paid per pack rose from £4.46 in 2007 to £258.19 by July 2017. The price of a single pill went up from 16p to £9.22, even though production costs remained broadly stable during that period, the CMA said. Concordia could be fined up to 10% of its worldwide annual turnover. Liothyronine tablets are used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition caused by a deficiency of the thyroid hormone that affects at least two in 100 people and can lead to depression, tiredness and weight gain. For many patients there is no alternative and, until this year, Concordia was the only supplier. This summer, the UK firm Morningside Healthcare and Israel’s Teva were granted licences to supply the drug. The medicine, a synthetic version of the hormone T3, is taken by patients who do not respond well to the cheaper alternative, levothyroxine.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Turnbull government has deployed new modelling on the national energy guarantee in an effort to step up pressure on state governments to sign up to its policy at a meeting of energy ministers on Friday. A summary of the modelling, circulated by the government in advance of the talks with the states, suggests household power bills between 2020 and 2030 would be “in the order of” $120 a year lower, in today’s dollars, than under a business-as-usual scenario, if the policy applied across the national electricity market. The material supplied by the government says wholesale electricity prices would be 23% lower than business-as-usual between 2020 and 2030, and it suggests the share of renewables in the market by 2030 “could range from 32% to 36%”. The full modelling, undertaken for the Energy Security Board by Frontier Economics, has not yet been distributed to state energy ministers and the documents circulated in Canberra are a summary of the findings, not the work itself. The Turnbull government announced in October it would dump the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and proceed with the national energy guarantee – a policy that imposes new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020. The policy requires cooperation from the states but some of the Labor governments, particularly South Australia, have been hostile. Part of the reason for that is the states were involved in the exhaustive consultations with Finkel about the clean energy target but were not kept in the loop about the national energy guarantee. Some state governments are also concerned the Turnbull policy will hard-bake coal into the system at the expense of renewables at a time when the energy market needs to transition to low-emissions power sources. A spokesman for the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, is continuing to insist that the state will not commit to sign on to the national energy guarantee in the absence of data showing its specific impact on the state. The Labor states have also commissioned their own work through the Council of Australian Governments energy council examining whether or not they could implement a clean energy target by themselves.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

A summary of the modelling, circulated by the government in advance of the talks with the states, suggests household power bills between 2020 and 2030 would be “in the order of” $120 a year lower, in today’s dollars, than under a business-as-usual scenario, if the policy applied across the national electricity market. The material supplied by the government says wholesale electricity prices would be 23% lower than business-as-usual between 2020 and 2030, and it suggests the share of renewables in the market by 2030 “could range from 32% to 36%”. The full modelling, undertaken for the Energy Security Board by Frontier Economics, has not yet been distributed to state energy ministers and the documents circulated in Canberra are a summary of the findings, not the work itself. The Turnbull government announced in October it would dump the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and proceed with the national energy guarantee – a policy that imposes new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020. The policy requires cooperation from the states but some of the Labor governments, particularly South Australia, have been hostile. Part of the reason for that is the states were involved in the exhaustive consultations with Finkel about the clean energy target but were not kept in the loop about the national energy guarantee. Some state governments are also concerned the Turnbull policy will hard-bake coal into the system at the expense of renewables at a time when the energy market needs to transition to low-emissions power sources. A spokesman for the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, is continuing to insist that the state will not commit to sign on to the national energy guarantee in the absence of data showing its specific impact on the state. The Labor states have also commissioned their own work through the Council of Australian Governments energy council examining whether or not they could implement a clean energy target by themselves.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n EasyJet saw its profits fall 17% last year, with more than £100m lost due to the slump in the pound after the Brexit vote. The airline reported a record year for passenger numbers, flying 80.2 million people, almost 10% more than in 2015-16, on ever fuller planes. But while revenues exceeded £5bn in 2016-17, fares dipped to fill seats in what the chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said was “a difficult year for the aviation industry”. McCall said: “Our planned approach of achieving number one or two positions at Europe’s leading airports, friendly and efficient customer service and a continuous focus on sustainable cost control, has put easyJet at a strategic advantage during a period when there have been bankruptcies and some airlines have struggled operationally.” Profits before tax fell from £494m to £408m. Despite paying a lower dollar price for fuel, the continued weakness of sterling brought additional costs of £101m, easyJet said. The airline will also be prompted by Brexit to change its rules to ensure easyJet is majority owned and controlled by EU nationals after 2019. About a third of shares are owned by the easyJet founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who has dual UK-Cypriot nationality, and will be classed as EU-owned. But easyJet will ask at its 2018 AGM for new powers to force UK shareholders to sell up if necessary to allow it to continue operating in Europe. McCall said the move was “a technical, administrative thing” and the airline had “no concerns” about getting enough EU shareholders. Shares rose by more than 5% in early trading, on the back of the airline reporting high levels of forward bookings and better revenue so far in its 2017-18 financial year, which it said was “primarily as a result of some capacity leaving the market”.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n EasyJet saw its profits fall 17% last year, with more than £100m lost due to the slump in the pound after the Brexit vote. The airline reported a record year for passenger numbers, flying 80.2 million people, almost 10% more than in 2015-16, on ever fuller planes. But while revenues exceeded £5bn in 2016-17, fares dipped to fill seats in what the chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said was “a difficult year for the aviation industry”. McCall said: “Our planned approach of achieving number one or two positions at Europe’s leading airports, friendly and efficient customer service and a continuous focus on sustainable cost control, has put easyJet at a strategic advantage during a period when there have been bankruptcies and some airlines have struggled operationally.” Profits before tax fell from £494m to £408m. Despite paying a lower dollar price for fuel, the continued weakness of sterling brought additional costs of £101m, easyJet said. The airline will also be prompted by Brexit to change its rules to ensure easyJet is majority owned and controlled by EU nationals after 2019. About a third of shares are owned by the easyJet founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who has dual UK-Cypriot nationality, and will be classed as EU-owned. But easyJet will ask at its 2018 AGM for new powers to force UK shareholders to sell up if necessary to allow it to continue operating in Europe. McCall said the move was “a technical, administrative thing” and the airline had “no concerns” about getting enough EU shareholders. Shares rose by more than 5% in early trading, on the back of the airline reporting high levels of forward bookings and better revenue so far in its 2017-18 financial year, which it said was “primarily as a result of some capacity leaving the market”.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"<<Airborne Woes Dust the Horizon>>\n\nSection 1\nEasyJet, the prominent British airline, witnessed a drastic decline in its profits last year, plummeting by an astonishing 17% due to the calamitous effects of the Brexit vote. The drastic slump in the pound led to a loss of over £100m, casting a pall of uncertainty over the airline's operations. Despite suffering this setback, Carolyn McCall, the astute CEO of EasyJet, revealed that the airline still managed to fly a record number of passengers, a staggering 80.2 million, a feat accomplished in 2016-17 surpassing the numbers from the previous year by an impressive 10%. Filling the seats shouldn't be an ever greater challenge, as the people now have more influence. They have the capacity to dare do more, just as there are fishermen on the several boats safer distant waters of Eilat port; working extra hard to provide fpr the Quick Cruise purpose or a brighter chance. Revenues reached a remarkable £5 billion mark last fiscal year as the airline's extensive network expanded. McCall acknowledged the \"difficult year\" that the aviation industry was going through as some airlines struggled to stay afloat while EasyJet maintained its top position, better positioned than its competitors to navigate the air bound by precedents.\n\nSection 2\nEasyJet's commitment to infrastructure development within the urban society appears to be heating up. Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the Airline's founder, will hold control through owning the third of the shares.
