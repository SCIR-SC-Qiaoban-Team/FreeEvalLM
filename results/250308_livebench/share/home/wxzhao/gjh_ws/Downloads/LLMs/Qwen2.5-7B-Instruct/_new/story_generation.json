      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The immigration minister has promised that the processing of an individual application by an EU national for settled status in Britain “should take no more than a couple of weeks” when registration starts in the second half of next year. The minister, Brandon Lewis, told the Commons home affairs select committee that an extra 1,200 UK visas and immigration staff were being recruited to process an expected 3.5m applications from EU nationals over two and a half years. He also told MPs on Tuesday that he was optimistic that an agreement could be struck by Christmas on the rights of EU citizens in the UK in the Brexit negotiations. However, he declined to comment on reports that the Brexit inner cabinet had decided on Monday that the European court of justice could continue to play a role in guaranteeing their rights during a two-year transition period. The Home Office minister did confirm that those refused “settled status” and classed as non-EU nationals in Britain illegally could have their bank accounts frozen and face deportation before the hearing of any appeal in British courts. The 3million group, representing EU nationals in Britain, immediately questioned Lewis’s claim that an agreement with the EU on “settled status” was likely before Christmas. “We wonder how. Major stumbling blocks still in place,” they tweeted, noting continued differences over the role of the ECJ, over family reunification rights that could affect thousands, and regarding clarification that they should not face “hostile environment measures”. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, voiced scepticism that an extra 1,200 staff – of whom 700 had already been recruited – would be sufficient when the UK Visas and Immigration agency (UKVI) currently used 6,500 staff to process 3m visa applications a year. There was already a three-month delay in processing EU nationals’ applications for permanent residence documents, she said.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"In the vibrant smattering of autumnal hues, Anna Ternheim, the Swedish pop icon, found herself earthly rooted yet exquisitely alienated. Surrounded by the magnetic charm of Rio de Janeiro, Ternheim channeled her dual state of mind into her seventh album, \"All the Way to Rio,\" a poignant and concise masterpiece that encapsulates a world both familiar and estranged. \n\nThe opening track, \"Dreams of Blue,\" sets the emotional stage with its melancholic yet beautiful melody. The lyrics veer almost into a confessional, hinting at a personal journey where the artist explores her own inner landscape. Yet, it is not her association with Rio as a tourist’s ideal escape, but rather a sanctuary from past acquaintances and ennui that resonates profoundly. The title track, “We ran from our friends \/ Saying they’re all the same,” becomes a guiding anthem, exuding a raw and palpable sense of disdain and longing.\n\nThe variety Ternheim infuses into her musical palette is nothing short of masterful. \"Hold On\" weaves a narrative through its intricate guitar work and the harmonious interplay between organ and vocals, creating a mesmerizing and dynamic composition. Conversely, \"Battered Soul\" adopts a simpler yet profoundly emotive approach, invoking REM’s ethereal soundscapes at their most pastoral and introspective, allowing for a more intimate and cautious exploration of the soul.\n\nHowever, even in a collection of such depth and character, one minor discordant note emerges. Despite the blissful ambiance that pervades much of the album, \"All the Way to Rio\" is jolted momentarily by the track that ends with the presumably self-deprecating lyric, “I’m having dreams of poo.” Nonetheless, this minor intrusion serves only to underscore the album’s overall charm and quirkiness, preserving its integrity without diminishing the listener’s experience.\n\nAll the Way to Rio is an album that demands your attention, spanning just eight songs, each less than four minutes long, but delivering an unparalleled pleasure coupé. It is a record that, on listening, feels like a seasonal release—a gift from autumn to winter, bringing melancholy warmth and the comfort of knowing that amidst the chaos, there's still a song.\n\nP.P.S: It's worth noting that the charm and depth of Ternheim’s music lie not just in the lyrics but in the layers of emotion she weaves into every composition. As more artists find inspiration in different worlds, “All the Way to Rio” stands out as a testament to how alienation and a sense of home can coexist in music.",

Not in the strictly financial sense, though how much more threadbare core public services can become without collapsing and causing social mayhem the next few years will prove, if the government lasts. Even with faltering economic growth, public spending is to go on falling as a proportion of GDP. It’s bankrupt in ideas, in understanding, in preparedness to examine what has been happening to public services. Housing offers a glaring example. For all the bells and whistles in the budget, and some welcome augmentation of council powers, the government fails to make an obvious connexion. Building houses, allocating land, encouraging development, and policing the delinquency of private developers all imply an active and financially lubricated local government. Housing is and always will be about places, streets, brownfields – and public acceptance of schemes that will abut on their property or where they walk their dog. That’s what councillors do. Ace ideologue of the free market Oliver Letwin, of all people, can’t substitute.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n This is a bankrupt budget. Not in the strictly financial sense, though how much more threadbare core public services can become without collapsing and causing social mayhem the next few years will prove, if the government lasts. Even with faltering economic growth, public spending is to go on falling as a proportion of GDP. It’s bankrupt in ideas, in understanding, in preparedness to examine what has been happening to public services. Housing offers a glaring example. For all the bells and whistles in the budget, and some welcome augmentation of council powers, the government fails to make an obvious connexion. Building houses, allocating land, encouraging development, and policing the delinquency of private developers all imply an active and financially lubricated local government. Housing is and always will be about places, streets, brownfields – and public acceptance of schemes that will abut on their property or where they walk their dog. That’s what councillors do. Ace ideologue of the free market Oliver Letwin, of all people, can’t substitute.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"\"According to an analysis in The Guardian, the newly proposed budget of the government is highly criticized for its approach and foresight, especially in the realm of housing. The following points encapsulate the core critique of the budget.\"\n\n* The proposed budget is deemed \"bankrupt\" not only in terms of financial stability but also in terms of ideas and strategic planning. This is largely attributed to the inability of the government to effectively address the practicalities of local housing solutions, indicating a disconnect between the ideologic framework and real-world implementation.\n* Despite some welcomed enhancements in council powers, the strategy lacks a cohesive and proactive approach to housing development. It overlooks the fundamental role of local government in not just regulating but actively participating and investing in the planning and development of residential areas.\n* The article specifically calls out the government’s failure to recognize that housing is multifaceted; it involves more than just provisions of land and incentives for developers. Engagement and approval from the community are crucial components of successful housing projects, a role that local councils are uniquely positioned to handle.\n* A notable figure in this critique is Oliver Letwin, described as an \"ideologue of the free market,\" whose approach fails to bridge the gap between market freedom and the necessary state intervention in ensuring socio-economic balance, particularly in housing.\n\nSECTION 2\nThese criticisms highlight the tension between economic theories and practical governance, emphasizing the need for a more balanced and community-focused approach to housing policies. The reliance on market mechanisms alone is seen as insufficient without a coordinated effort by local authorities to facilitate and oversee the process of housing development.\n\nSECTION 3\nThis analysis underscores the critical role of local governance and community involvement in addressing the housing crisis, suggesting that true progress would require a reassessment of the current budgetary approach and a more integrated strategy encompassing public engagement and active governmental involvement.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky has died aged 55. The news was announced on his Facebook page: “On behalf of the Hvorostovsky family, it is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Dmitri Hvorostovsky – beloved operatic baritone, husband, father, son, and friend – at age 55. After a two-and-a-half-year battle with brain cancer, he died peacefully this morning, November 22, surrounded by family near his home in London, UK. May the warmth of his voice and his spirit always be with us.” Hvorostovsky was born in a tough industrial city in Siberia, telling an interviewer in 2002 that as a high school student, prison looked a more likely destination than the opera stage, with “drinking, drugs and fighting,” part of his adolescence. A teenage obsession with pop music also almost claimed the singer for a different world, and his hard drinking and wild behaviour continued into his 20s and early 30s. He came to international attention in 1989 when he beat Bryn Terfel to win the Cardiff Singer of the World title. With his prematurely white hair, dashing good looks and powerful stage presence, his heartthrob image was carefully cultivated and he amassed legions of fans. A career performing in all the major opera houses and concert halls followed, and he was hailed one of the world’s greatest baritones for the rich, expressive fluidity of his voice. His fame allowed him to bring the neglected and little known Russian song repertoire into western halls, most notably with the remarkable accompanist Ivari Ilja. In the opera house he was particularly feted for his performances of Verdi, and also his charismatic and provocative interpretation of Tchaikovksy’s antihero Eugene Onegin, a role he made his own.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The news was announced on his Facebook page: “On behalf of the Hvorostovsky family, it is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Dmitri Hvorostovsky – beloved operatic baritone, husband, father, son, and friend – at age 55. After a two-and-a-half-year battle with brain cancer, he died peacefully this morning, November 22, surrounded by family near his home in London, UK. May the warmth of his voice and his spirit always be with us.” Hvorostovsky was born in a tough industrial city in Siberia, telling an interviewer in 2002 that as a high school student, prison looked a more likely destination than the opera stage, with “drinking, drugs and fighting,” part of his adolescence. A teenage obsession with pop music also almost claimed the singer for a different world, and his hard drinking and wild behaviour continued into his 20s and early 30s. He came to international attention in 1989 when he beat Bryn Terfel to win the Cardiff Singer of the World title. With his prematurely white hair, dashing good looks and powerful stage presence, his heartthrob image was carefully cultivated and he amassed legions of fans. A career performing in all the major opera houses and concert halls followed, and he was hailed one of the world’s greatest baritones for the rich, expressive fluidity of his voice. His fame allowed him to bring the neglected and little known Russian song repertoire into western halls, most notably with the remarkable accompanist Ivari Ilja. In the opera house he was particularly feted for his performances of Verdi, and also his charismatic and provocative interpretation of Tchaikovksy’s antihero Eugene Onegin, a role he made his own.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that the chancellor faced a long period of lower than expected wages growth that would dent tax receipts and push up borrowing. The cumulative effect over the life of the parliament would add £90.5bn to the UK’s debt pile and jeopardise Hammond’s target of balancing the government’s books by 2025, it said. The Treasury said that once the positive effects of an increase in employment and better than expected borrowing over the last year are taken into account, the net borrowing rise would be £35bn, putting the chancellor in a position to reach his target of creating a surplus in the middle of the next decade. But some analysts said the OBR’s revision failed to go far enough and it continued to overestimate the capacity of British businesses to invest in new equipment and processes to drive up productivity. They argued that the forecaster should have gone further and predicted that productivity growth – which measures the average output per hour worked – of almost zero over the last seven years would continue for another five years. Joanna Davies, a UK economist at Fathom Consulting, said the OBR’s new forecast that productivity would increase at a rate of 1.1% until 2022 – almost half the 2.1% average seen in the 30 years before 2007 – still looked ambitious. She said the prospects for GDP growth would suffer a severe knock-on effect from lower productivity and a rapidly ageing population. “Over the last five years, productivity growth has averaged just 0.3%,” she said. “Combined with UN projections for working-age population growth, the UK’s trend rate of overall economic growth is probably somewhere in the range 0.5%-1% – around half the 1.5% assumed by the OBR.” The OBR chair, Robert Chote, said GDP growth would not only be hit by lower productivity, but also a weaker than expected export sector that would fail to benefit significantly from the lower pound.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"In a significant blow to the UK’s economic plans, the independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has downgraded expectations for productivity growth. This downgrade means that Philip Hammond, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, now faces the challenges of borrowing an extra £90bn over the next five years. This revision, based on lower-than-expected productivity growth, means that the OBR has warned of a prolonged period of lower wage growth. Consequently, this will impact tax receipts, thereby increasing borrowing, adding £90.5bn over the duration of the parliamentary term and threatening Hammond’s goal of achieving a balanced government budget by 2025.\n\nTraditionally, an improvement in productivity has been seen as a key indicator of economic health, as it measures the average output per hour worked. However, the OBR’s revised forecast predicts only a modest 1.1% increase in productivity over the coming five years, reflecting a drastic shift from the 2.1% average seen in the 30 years prior to 2007. The economic fallout of this relatively low productivity coupled with an ageing population poses significant challenges for GDP growth.\n\nAccording to Joana Davies, a UK economist at Fathom Consulting, the current forecast could be optimistic. She asserts that based on the accumulative impact of the lag in productivity growth (which has averaged 0.3% over the last five years) and demographic trends, the UK’s trend rate of economic growth is likely to fall in the range of 0.5%-1%. This is markedly lower than the 1.5% growth assumed by the OBR, suggesting that the economic recovery may be more sluggish than anticipated.\n\nFurther complicating matters, the OBR anticipates that export performance will lag behind expectations due to the weaker pound. As a result, the combination of subdued productivity, a sluggish export sector, and demographic headwinds paints a challenging picture for the UK’s economic outlook.\n\nThe projections highlighted by the OBR mark a stark contrast to the government’s original borrowing targets. Despite these challenges, the Treasury maintains that, considering factors such as employment growth and better-than-expected borrowing outcomes from the previous year, the net borrowing rise would be around £35bn. This improved position is said to place the Chancellor in a favorable posture to achieve a government budget surplus in the middle of the next decade.\n\nP.P.S: The economic strategies in place will need to adapt to these new realities to ensure the UK can navigate through the upcoming fiscal years with the least disruption possible.",

This revision, based on lower-than-expected productivity growth, means that the OBR has warned of a prolonged period of lower wage growth. Consequently, this will impact tax receipts, thereby increasing borrowing, adding £90.5bn over the duration of the parliamentary term and threatening Hammond’s goal of achieving a balanced government budget by 2025.\n\nTraditionally, an improvement in productivity has been seen as a key indicator of economic health, as it measures the average output per hour worked. However, the OBR’s revised forecast predicts only a modest 1.1% increase in productivity over the coming five years, reflecting a drastic shift from the 2.1% average seen in the 30 years prior to 2007. The economic fallout of this relatively low productivity coupled with an ageing population poses significant challenges for GDP growth.\n\nAccording to Joana Davies, a UK economist at Fathom Consulting, the current forecast could be optimistic. She asserts that based on the accumulative impact of the lag in productivity growth (which has averaged 0.3% over the last five years) and demographic trends, the UK’s trend rate of economic growth is likely to fall in the range of 0.5%-1%. This is markedly lower than the 1.5% growth assumed by the OBR, suggesting that the economic recovery may be more sluggish than anticipated.\n\nFurther complicating matters, the OBR anticipates that export performance will lag behind expectations due to the weaker pound. As a result, the combination of subdued productivity, a sluggish export sector, and demographic headwinds paints a challenging picture for the UK’s economic outlook.\n\nThe projections highlighted by the OBR mark a stark contrast to the government’s original borrowing targets. Despite these challenges, the Treasury maintains that, considering factors such as employment growth and better-than-expected borrowing outcomes from the previous year, the net borrowing rise would be around £35bn. This improved position is said to place the Chancellor in a favorable posture to achieve a government budget surplus in the middle of the next decade.\n\nP.P.S: The economic strategies in place will need to adapt to these new realities to ensure the UK can navigate through the upcoming fiscal years with the least disruption possible.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n MPs have been forced to deny that a Commons vote last week means animals are not recognised in the UK as sentient life forms. An amendment to the European Union (withdrawal bill to transfer the EU protocol on animal sentience into UK law was defeated by 313 votes to 295 on 15 November, and since then a row has developed as to what the vote meant in practice. Describing some of the reporting on the vote as “weird and dishonest”, Tory MP Zac Goldsmith tweeted a clarification that the vote had been about the correct legal procedure for ensuring animal welfare standards – not on the principle of whether animals are sentient. Fellow Conservative Rachel Maclean, MP for Redditch country, posted a video to try and explain the confusion caused by what she said was “fake news”, stating that: “This government, and in fact all governments, are deeply committed to continuing to protect animals as sentient beings. That law is already written into our own law.” Theresa May said at Wednesday’s PMQs: “We recognise and respect that animals are sentient beings, and should be treated accordingly.” Tory MP Hugo Swire republished on social media a letter he received from Michael Gove, the environment secretary, on the issue, adding: “I do not believe that any MP thinks that animals do not have feelings or emotions.” Nevertheless, the vote has triggered protests from animal rights groups, including multiple online petitions aimed at the House of Lords, UK parliament and Gove. Public figures including the presenter Sue Perkins have voiced strong criticism of MPs over the issue. Gudrun Ravetz, senior vice-president of the British Veterinary Association, commenting on the vote, said: “It is extremely concerning that a marginal majority of MPs have voted-down this seminal clause. This action undermines the government’s previous promises that the UK will continue to be known for our high standards of animal health and welfare post-Brexit.” However, Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley, pointed out that EU law still allowed many practices across Europe that animal rights groups oppose. The amendment, proposed by the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas, among others, had set out to specifically incorporate article 13 of title II of the Lisbon treaty into UK law. During debate on the amendment last Wednesday, Lucas pointed out that the origins of the clause began with the 1997 UK presidency of the EU and that from 1999 EU law had explicitly recognised that animals were sentient life forms.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

You’ll find everything from grand ensembles to intimate solo confessionals, and this recording is best suited to the latter. That’s because conductor Pablo Heras-Casado has a tendency to over-shape the bigger stuff, to traffic-control the corners and smooth out the ride. With Monteverdi, we need the rough and the spontaneous. But individual musicians and singers of the Balthasar Neumann are wonderful, and they shine in their nimble duos and trios – try the piercingly delivered Salve Regina from sopranos Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The name of this 1640 collection means “moral and spiritual forest” and it is Monteverdi in the most exploratory mood – the culmination of his three decades as maestro di cappella at St Mark’s Basilica in Venice, with its sumptuous acoustic and crack instrumental band and 40-piece choir to match. You’ll find everything from grand ensembles to intimate solo confessionals, and this recording is best suited to the latter. That’s because conductor Pablo Heras-Casado has a tendency to over-shape the bigger stuff, to traffic-control the corners and smooth out the ride. With Monteverdi, we need the rough and the spontaneous. But individual musicians and singers of the Balthasar Neumann are wonderful, and they shine in their nimble duos and trios – try the piercingly delivered Salve Regina from sopranos Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"In 1640, Giovanni Battista da Caserta, a devotee dedicated to the preservation of early music, embarked on a significant journey to Venice. His goal was to secure a priceless manuscript collection bound in elegant red leather, adorned with heraldic motifs that portrayed a \"moral and spiritual forest.\" This collection, the culmination of Monteverdi's three-decade tenure as maestro di cappella at the majestic St Mark’s Basilica, was a treasure trove of music that embodied the composer's exploratory spirit.\n\nWithin the hallowed halls of St Mark’s Basilica, where the stunning acoustics and grandeur of the space echoed through the centuries, Monteverdi's work thrived. Under his direction, the cracks in the instruments and the depth of the choir were no mere imperfections but integral elements of the music. The ensemble was composed of a crack instrumental band and a 40-piece choir, each piece of music crafted to mesh with the setting to create a tapestry of sound. As Giovanni carefully examined the score, he could almost hear the specter of Monteverdi conducting, his hand guiding the ensemble through the rough patches and spontaneous moments that imbued the work with life.\n\nUpon returning to his homeland, Giovanni entrusted the manuscript to a distinguished network of musicians and performers. One such performer was Pablo Heras-Casado, a renowned conductor known for his meticulous approach to detailed music, particularly in Baroque compositions. However, when it came to Monteverdi's work, Heras-Casado found himself in a paradoxical situation. While he excelled in controlling the larger ensemble, there was a tendency to over-shape the pieces, smoothing out the corners and dulling the edges that made Monteverdi's works so dynamic. Recognizing this, the musicians and singers of the Balthasar Neumann quartet sought a balance, allowing the rough and spontaneous elements to shine through in their performances.\n\nOne of the standout moments from the 1640 collection is the poignant Salve Regina. Sung by sopranos Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner, the piece encapsulates the intimate and confessional nature of Monteverdi's music. Their voices, piercing and clear, cut through the ensemble, offering a direct and unadulterated connection to the spiritual journey Monteverdi intended. In their nimble duos and trios, the musicians of the Balthasar Neumann quartet brought warmth and authenticity to the performance, ensuring that each note resonated with the essence of the composer's intent.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has promised to donate part of her fee from appearing in I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here to a homeless charity as she defended her decision to appear in the show. Dugdale rejected complaints from her Labour colleagues at Holyrood that taking part in the ITV reality show was akin to taking a second job, but admitted she would be well paid for it. Speaking to show-business reporters in Australia for the first time since her participation provoked a backlash from other Labour MSPs, Dugdale insisted the show would allow her to connect with voters. She said she had set aside three weeks’ salary as an MSP for the Rock Trust homeless charity and not a motor neurone disease campaign as previously thought. Dugdale launched a @TeamKez Twitter feed on Wednesday morning, featuring a short video clip recorded before she left Edinburgh of her wearing a Rock Trust T-shirt, where she addressed her constituents, and by extension her Labour critics. She said in the film: “I appreciate that to quite a few of my constituents, this is quite a controversial move. I know there will be people upset about it, that will question my priorities.” Saying they deserved an explanation, she added: “First and foremost, I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here is a huge UK-wide television programme, with an audience into the millions. “I think it’s an amazing opportunity to talk to young people who watch this programme about politics, and – in particular – Labour values. The Daily Record, which employs her as a columnist, quoted her as saying: “I have a record of giving money to charity. This isn’t a second job, this is three weeks out of my work.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Entire output should be wrapped in JSON format.

    "response":"In the heart of London, on a misty autumn evening, the echoes of a profound and moving performance filled the air. The venue was one of the most fashionable addresses in the city, a Wimpole Street drawing room transformed into a temple of music. This extraordinary event was a homage to Johannes Brahms, the great composer known for his German Requiem, a piece he chose to be performed in the vernacular of his country.\n\nThe performance, a recording made on what would have been the 1871 date when a similar gathering took place, was not just a mere recreation but a tribute to Brahms’s ideals. The organizers, with a keen eye and a deep understanding of music, decided to perform the Requiem in English, adhering closely to the choice of the original text. To complement this, they used Brahms’s original piano (four hands) accompaniment, a unique and intimate setting that resonated with the spirit of the piece.\n\nThe ensemble was small, fitting the chamber performance that remained faithful to the original conditions. The choir, consisting of young voices, provided a luminous and vibrant onset to the music. The singers’ enunciation was exemplary, making it easy to appreciate the poetic and emotional depth of the text. However, a cloud of disappointment lingered over the performance due to the diction of the soprano soloist, Mary Bevan. Despite her otherwise divine performance, the clarity of her voice was marred, a遗憾之处，有损整体的完美氛围。\n\n整个演出中，最打动人心的部分是合唱团年轻歌手们的声音，他们的吟诵清晰而动情，使文本中的诗性和情感深度得以呈现。然而，如果单从演唱者的角度来看，真正令人沮丧的是玛丽·比万（Mary Bevan）的独唱部分。尽管她的整体表现近乎完美，但她演唱时吐字的模糊还是在一定程度上破坏了这场演出的完美氛围。\n\n总体来说，这场演出是对勃拉姆斯及其作品的一次深情致敬。尽管存在一些遗憾，它仍然提供了一次难忘的音乐体验，让人们得以在这样一个特别的环境下重温这位伟大作曲家的独特之声。 Is there anything else I can help with?\n\nP.P.S. 这不仅仅是一场音乐的再现，更是一场情感的交融。每一种情感，无论是欢乐还是忧伤，都在旋律中得到完美的体现。",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Google has confirmed it has been able to track the location of Android users via the addresses of local mobile phone masts, even when location services were turned off and the sim cards removed to protect privacy. Revealed by a report by Quartz, Google’s Android system, which handles messaging services to ensure delivery of push notifications, began requesting the unique addresses of mobile phone masts (called Cell ID) at the beginning of 2017. The information was captured by the phone and routinely sent to Google by any modern Android device, even when location services were turned off and the sim card was removed. As a result Google could in theory track the location of the Android device and therefore the user, despite a reasonable expectation of privacy. A Google spokesperson said: “In January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery. “However, we never incorporated Cell ID into our network sync system, so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated it to no longer request Cell ID.” Google requested the Cell ID alongside what is called the mobile country code and mobile network code, which identify the country and mobile phone operator that the smartphone is using. That data is used to ensure the phone stays properly connected to Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging system, which handles the delivery of messages and notifications to the smartphone. A persistent connection is required for the system to work, but instead of staying constantly connected, the phone pings Google’s servers at set intervals. The more pings, the greater the battery drain, so the data collected about the country and mobile networks is used to work out the the minimum number of pings required to stay connected without draining the battery – so called heartbeat analysis. The benefit of having the address of the mobile phone mast to ensure message service reliability is not clear, but through a process of triangulation – the same used to assist when a user is actively using location services – the position of the user can be revealed down to a roughly 400m radius at a minimum, and often much more accurately in urban areas.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

It is a delectably gentle, elegant, self-effacing performance.

A mishap on the banks of, and then in, the Seine leads to an encounter with a romantic tramp called Dom (Dominique Abel). It’s a classic French entertainment that could have been produced almost any time in the last 60 years. There is a sophistication in its childlike guilelessness and also a cameo for veteran French comedy player Pierre Richard.

This movie is as sweet-natured as Abel and Gordon’s debut film Rumba, and they break out some serious tango movies here, too. It’s a little gem.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['fire', 'meeting', 'quote', 'society', 'wheel'] in the response.

    "response":"Section 1\nEmmanuelle Riva, the exemplary actress known for roles in films like Hiroshima Mon Amour and Amour, left behind a legacy of elegant and timeless performances. Her final film appearance was in a delightful comedy titled \"Mishap,\" directed by Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon. The film, drawing humor and charm from a classic French comedic style, narrates a whimsical tale of a meeting between a young Canadian visitor, Fiona, and her eccentric aunt, Marthe, played by Riva herself. Riva's character Marthe, a lovable, somewhat scatterbrained old lady, opens the film with a gentle self-effacing performance that resonates with audiences.\n\nSection 2\nAt a conference discussing traditional and contemporary cinema in Paris, a quote by Riva was shared: \"Cinema is a journey, not a destination.\" This insight, accompanying the screening of \"Mishap,\" served as a poignant reminder of Riva's enduring influence. \"Mishap\" not only offers entertainment but also a deeper reflection on the continuation of French film traditions. The screenplay, clever and funny, showcases a sophisticated yet childlike guilelessness reflecting the filmmaking duo's dedication to honoring the art form's heritage.\n\nSection 3\nIn \"Mishap,\" Fiona, portrayed by Gordon, accidentally meets a romantic tramp named Dom, played by Dominique Abel, while on the banks of the Seine. This mishap sets the stage for an unexpected encounter and a series of lighthearted adventures. The film's humor and structure mimic the gentle nature of classic French comedies, emphasizing the relevance of such films to modern society. Through the eyes of Marthe, the film explores societal attitudes and values through a lens of innocence and whimsy, preserving the tradition of French comedic cinema.\n\nSection 4\nThe film features a scene where Marthe learns to dance the tango, a sequence complementing the film's comedic elements with depth and poignant sentiment. Riva's presence as the dancing matriarch adds another layer of authenticity and charm. The tango sequence also serves as a metaphor for life's unexpected turns and the joy found in the journey. In a post-screening panel discussion, Abel and Gordon shared fire for Riva, describing her involvement as rejuvenating for the film. Her talent and spirit brought a unique energy to \"Mishap,\" making the film a little gem of filmic artistry.\n\nSection 5\nP.P.S\nThe enduring impact of Emmanuelle Riva and films like \"Mishap\" highlights the importance of timeless storytelling and the art of cinema in society. As Abel and Gordon's journey in filmmaking continues, their debut film serves as a testament to the enduring spirit of classic French cinema. The film's clever and gentle humor, capturing moments of life's unpredictability, inspires a continued appreciation for the nuanced storytelling present in French comedies. Riva's final performance in \"Mishap\" not only honors her remarkable career but also illuminates the essential role of entertainment in society, reminding us of the joy in life's little mishaps and adventures.",

    "response":"<<Horse Racing's New Transparency>>\n\nIn the world of horse racing, often cloaked in mystery and kept behind a veil of secrecy, Chris Cook highlights a significant shift that brings some much-needed light. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) has taken a step towards greater transparency with the decision that wind operations will need to be declared in the future. This is part of a suite of measures introduced under the leadership of Nick Rust, aimed at creating a more punter-friendly atmosphere.\n\nThe internet buzz, as always, is a mixed bag. On one side, there’s collective exhaling of relief among betting enthusiasts who were eager to get more of the inside scoop. Many view this as a legitimate move towards openness and a way for enthusiasts to gather a diverse set of data points to inform their betting decisions.\n\nHowever, a curious undercurrent of skepticism can be detected from some horse trainers. Their response to the new directive reflects a deeper issue that may lie beyond mere professionalism. One trainer, when asked his thoughts, mentioned that many (if not most) wind ops don’t have the purported positive effects on a horse’s performance, and thus, he contended, these operations might indeed be disappointing for punters to learn about.\n\nChris Cook, the informed commentator, swiftly interjected, his tone clear and unshakeable amidst the chatter. “It’s like suggesting that being handed the blueprint to the mint will not give you the edge in a game of cards,” he said, paralleling the euphoria of discovering betting secrets with the less glamorous truth that all such revelations are part of a larger market that adjusts and balances over time.\n\nHe contended that even if these wind operations, which enhance a horse’s ability to breathe, worked flawlessly every time, the information would still be taken into account by the betting markets. Thus, the odds would swiftly adjust, making it hard to profit from such information unless one had access to much more than what the operation itself could reveal.\n\nTrainers, he opined, often overcomplicate the pursuit of performance enhancement, believing their skills to be shrouded in a magical aura. But ultimately, it is about the numbers and how the market interprets new information. For first-time operations, the success rate might not be sky-high, but the fact that it will be known is a significant milestone.\n\nAs this new directive comes into effect, the true impact on the industry will be evident. Racing enthusiasts will be given new dimensions to peruse for their bets, while trainers will be under pressure to justify their every move in the public eye. The dialogue surrounding horseracing is bound to be richer with this newfound transparency, ushering in a new era of informed jousting between bettors and those who aspire to run the licensed races.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has become embroiled in a bizarre Twitter row with the comedy actor Ralf Little over the state of NHS mental healthcare. The standoff began two weeks ago after Hunt’s appearance on The Andrew Marr Show, when Hunt stated that the NHS had overseen “the biggest expansion of mental health provision in Europe”. Little, best known for his role as Anthony in the sitcom The Royle Family, accused the health secretary in a tweet of “knowingly lying” to the public about statistics and told Hunt to sue him if he was wrong. Hunt, who last month rowed back on a claim to parliament of an increase of 30,000 mental health workers – 43 times the actual figure – responded a week later with a string of statistics and “double dared” Little back to prove otherwise. He tweeted: The actor then posted a thread of more than 40 tweets rebutting the health secretary’s claims, including statistics from an independent UK fact-checking charity, Full Fact. That thread has been shared more than 15,000 times. The argument has since rolled on. Hunt on Monday replied with a series of 26 tweets of his own (although losing the chronology in the middle of the thread, making it difficult to follow). “Now I know you are a funny bloke and in politics a lot of insults are traded but the question is can you back up what is a very strong claim?” he asked Little, referring back to his “lying to the public” comment. “To fill the gap [in mental health staffing levels] we now have 8,000 MH nurses in training and have this Sept announced an increase in nurse training places overall by 25%.” Hunt also quoted from a New York Times article from July, which has been corrected three times after the former shadow minister for mental health, Luciana Berger, challenged its contents.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Little accused Hunt of \"knowingly lying\" during the show and issued a challenge, stating that Hunt should sue him if he was proven wrong.\n\nSection 2\nHunt's response was swift but diplomatic. He addressed the accusation of lying, quoting the official NHS statistics at his disposal. To complicate matters, Hunt's credibility was further questioned when it was revealed that he had previously misstated the number of mental health workers in the NHS by a factor of 43.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n This is a seductively enjoyable, smart and well-acted film based on the most deadly serious sporting contest of modern times: the Battle of the Sexes tennis match of 1973 in a packed Houston Astrodome. It stars Emma Stone and Steve Carell, respectively women’s No 1 Billie Jean King and fiftysomething ex-champ and self-proclaimed “male chauvinist pig” Bobby Riggs – fighting to prove that men are better at tennis and better, full stop. The film crucially faces the same challenge as the participants from real life: the challenge of tone. How unseriously should this match be taken? How strenuously should the attitude of casual jokiness be maintained? No one involved in this encounter could be certain of its outcome; neither side could be sure of avoiding humiliation, and thus everyone had a vested interest in keeping it light. Up to a point. But only one side was facing jokiness as a weapon, the same weapon of boorish condescension and toxic bantz that they faced outside the sporting arena every day of their lives. The movie displays the same gracious good humour as its heroine. In 1973, King was enraged by the fact that female players on the grand slam circuit were paid a tiny fraction of what the men got, despite pulling in the same number of paying customers.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n This is a seductively enjoyable, smart and well-acted film based on the most deadly serious sporting contest of modern times: the Battle of the Sexes tennis match of 1973 in a packed Houston Astrodome. It stars Emma Stone and Steve Carell, respectively women’s No 1 Billie Jean King and fiftysomething ex-champ and self-proclaimed “male chauvinist pig” Bobby Riggs – fighting to prove that men are better at tennis and better, full stop. The film crucially faces the same challenge as the participants from real life: the challenge of tone. How unseriously should this match be taken? How strenuously should the attitude of casual jokiness be maintained? No one involved in this encounter could be certain of its outcome; neither side could be sure of avoiding humiliation, and thus everyone had a vested interest in keeping it light. Up to a point. But only one side was facing jokiness as a weapon, the same weapon of boorish condescension and toxic bantz that they faced outside the sporting arena every day of their lives. The movie displays the same gracious good humour as its heroine. In 1973, King was enraged by the fact that female players on the grand slam circuit were paid a tiny fraction of what the men got, despite pulling in the same number of paying customers.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"In the story of \"Battle of the Sexes,\" the 1973 tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, the history of gender inequality in sports was brought into sharp focus. The matter was not just about tennis; it was about the fundamental respect and recognition of women's contributions to a sport that they had been excelling in for decades. The film, starring Emma Stone and Steve Carell, stayed true to the essence of the match, highlighting the clash between professionalism and chauvinism. The code of conduct that had long defined Riggs' approach to women in tennis was a stark reminder of the battles still to be fought.\n\nThe campaign to ensure women received equal pay and treatment did not begin and end with the Battle of the Sexes. It was a matter of decades of struggle, with King at the forefront of many of the key moments. Under her leadership, the matter of equal pay became a campaign that resonated with the young and the old, those who had borne witness to the changes and those ready to demand change.\n\nThe movie captured the tension and the humor in the buildup to the match, showing how seriously Kenya would face each of Riggs' jabs and boorish comments. It was a historical moment where a young generation saw a champion fight for her right and those who would follow her. The portrayal of King’s gracious and resilient character stood in stark contrast to Riggs' toxic attitudes, making the Battle of the Sexes not just a man-versus-woman contest, but a battle for integrity and respect.\n\nThrough the film, the matter of identity and equality was brought to the forefront, reminding the audience of the importance of these issues in shaping the future. It was a testament to the fact that the battle for gender equality is a continuous struggle, with each victory serving as a stepping stone for the next campaign.\n\nThe movie, while packed with humor and entertainment, was a serious call to action. It highlighted the importance of perseverance and the role of individuals like Billie Jean King in driving social change. The match itself was a matter of more than just tennis points; it was about the fight for respect and equality that resonates even today.\n\nIn the end, the movie challenged the audience to consider the challenges faced not just by Billie Jean King, but by all those who have fought and will continue to fight for equality. The challenge of tone in depicting the match was not taken lightly, as the film aimed to strike a balance between humor and seriousness, reflecting the real-life complexities.\n\nAny other questions? P.S. The enduring legacy of the Battle of the Sexes and the role of Billie Jean King in sports and beyond continues to inspire and challenge us to this day, proving that sometimes, the most meaningful fights are the hardest to win.",

    "response":"Theatrical Remembrance: Ukraine's War Through Women's Eyes\nTheater has a remarkable ability to bring forgotten stories to light, a capability that Natal'ya Vorozhbit's play, expertly translated by Sasha Dugdale, beautifully demonstrates. The play serves as a poignant reminder of the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia and the war that followed, particularly the often-overlooked role of women caught in its brutal crossfire. The six vignettes vividly depict the multifaceted impact of the conflict on Ukrainian society. The play opens with the personal story of Natal'ya, a Kiev-based writer on a research trip to the war zone a year after the siege of Donetsk Airport. Her tale of a blossoming relationship with a patriotic escort, who served as her guide through the dangerous terrain, is profoundly moving. This vignette is particularly impactful due to the storyteller's honesty and the heavy double guilt she feels—of seeking love in a region where men were fighting and killing each other. \n\nThe subsequent scenes continue to draw a harrowing picture of the war's toll on women’s lives. One vignette chronicles teenage girls eagerly awaiting soldiers, showing the allure and desperation mixed with naivety that can lead young women to embrace the military's outward appearance of power. Another scene illustrates the devastating aftermath of conflict, a female medic desperately transporting the headless corpse of her beloved to the morgue. The last vignette focuses on a young journalist who cleverly outwits her captor, highlighting the resilience and ingenuity required to survive in such perilous conditions. \n\nWhile the play effectively showcases the personal stories and the blurring lines between heroism and violence, it does not delve deeply enough into the complex political dynamics that fueled the war.

Vorozhbit's work, translated by Sasha Dugdale, is a narrative of female casualties of the war, unveiling the often-overlooked side of the conflict. The play is structured into six vignettes, each highlighting a different aspect of the war's impact on women.\n\nIn the first vignette, which is particularly gripping, a Kiev-based writer named Natal'ya recounts her journey to the battle zone a year after the Donetsk airport siege.

However, it is clear that the soldiers themselves are just as victims of the conflict, their identities and humanity overshadowed by the call of duty.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Science is littered with tales of visionaries who paid for pioneering research to prove their theories, and this weekend “Mad” Mike Hughes is hoping to join them. He plans to launch a homemade rocket in California as part of a bid to eventually prove that the Earth is flat. Hughes has spent $20,000 (£15,000) building the steam-powered rocket in his spare time, and will be livestreaming the launch over the internet. The self-described daredevil says he switched his focus to rockets after twice breaking his back doing stunt jumps in cars. “I don’t believe in science,” declared the 61-year-old. “I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air. But that’s not science, that’s just a formula.” The rocket, which Hughes aims to reach an altitude of 1,800ft (550 metres) over California, will be launched from the back of a converted motorhome purchased from Craigslist. It is sponsored by a flat Earth research group, and Hughes plans a subsequent trip to try and observe the flatness of the Earth for himself. Speaking about the risks of the flight, Hughes said: “It’s scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive.” Hughes’ website describes him as “the only man to design, build and launch himself in a rocket” – he previously flew in his own rocket in 2014, as this footage shows. Hughes has stated that once he lands at the weekend, he intends to announce that he is running for the governorship of California.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Science is littered with tales of visionaries who paid for pioneering research to prove their theories, and this weekend “Mad” Mike Hughes is hoping to join them. He plans to launch a homemade rocket in California as part of a bid to eventually prove that the Earth is flat. Hughes has spent $20,000 (£15,000) building the steam-powered rocket in his spare time, and will be livestreaming the launch over the internet. The self-described daredevil says he switched his focus to rockets after twice breaking his back doing stunt jumps in cars. “I don’t believe in science,” declared the 61-year-old. “I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air. But that’s not science, that’s just a formula.” The rocket, which Hughes aims to reach an altitude of 1,800ft (550 metres) over California, will be launched from the back of a converted motorhome purchased from Craigslist. It is sponsored by a flat Earth research group, and Hughes plans a subsequent trip to try and observe the flatness of the Earth for himself. Speaking about the risks of the flight, Hughes said: “It’s scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive.” Hughes’ website describes him as “the only man to design, build and launch himself in a rocket” – he previously flew in his own rocket in 2014, as this footage shows. Hughes has stated that once he lands at the weekend, he intends to announce that he is running for the governorship of California.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Surging levels of violence at an “unsafe” G4S-run youth jail have put staff in hospital and caused inmates to carry improvised weapons for their safety, inspectors have revealed. The damning inspection report into Oakhill secure training centre, near Milton Keynes, was published on Tuesday as MPs heard that ministers had ordered G4S to set up an external inquiry into abuse allegations at Brook House, the immigration removal centre at Gatwick, which is also run by the private security firm. The joint report by the prison inspectors, with Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission, into Oakhill in September and October – when the centre was near capacity, with 75 boys aged 14 to 17 – finds “no evidence that staff can adequately care and control this volume of young people”. The report rates the youth prison as “inadequate” and says there has been an increase in fights and assaults since the last inspection in January; it records 330 assaults between March and August this year alone, with assaults against staff increasing, including against newly recruited staff, and some so serious they have led to people being taken to hospital. “One manager said that young people are carrying improvised weapons because they do not feel safe. This inhibits some staff from intervening because of the fear of a weapon, and this in turn reinforces the view of young people that staff cannot protect them, thereby continuing the cycle,” the report says. The inspectors say that many of the recommendations from their January inspection have not been met and the centre has deteriorated in most respects, including to do with safety, care, education, resettlement and the “effectiveness of leaders and managers”. They say that unacceptable behaviour, including swearing, intimidation and vandalism, is not being challenged by staff. Oakhill’s newly appointed interim director, Lisette Saunders, said: “We take these findings very seriously.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The best thing about dining alone, what it means to be a care worker and the spread of light pollution have provoked some of the most interesting reader discussion around the Guardian today. To get involved, you can click on the links in the comments below to expand the conversation and add your thoughts. We’ll continue to highlight more comments worth visiting as the day goes on. What’s the best thing about dining on your own? The people-watching In this month’s food column, Jay Rayner wrote that: “The pleasures of eating alone are obvious. You get to eat what you want, how you want. It is one of adulthood’s great indulgences. But who admits to its other profound pleasure, the licence it gives you to spy on people?” You responded with some of your own experiences. ‘I’ve met some interesting people that way’ ‘Good eating for me is inextricably linked with good company’ ‘I take a good book and do some people-watching’ What being a care worker taught me: the human spirit needs more than the basics Community care worker, Sarah Beauclerk wrote about her moving experiences as a care worker which prompted readers to talk about what they learned looking after others. ‘This job taught me some things about our society that I strongly criticise and hate’ ‘Daily living aids and assistive technology can help people continue to live their lives with dignity’ Why the nights are getting brighter - but not in a good way Many of you who like to look up at the stars were concerned to hear satellite observations show light pollution is spreading and affecting the level of darkness across the world.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

She had been a care worker for several years and her job taught her the significance of dignity in human life, a lesson that she traced back to the actions of a particular elderly patient whose struggle with chronic digestive issues transformed her views on daily living aids. Linda, though she could no longer go on long walks, found comfort in small developments like the installation of a new lightweight stomach pump, designed to minimize the discomfort she experienced.\n\nOne evening, as Sarah stood under the expanding canopy of a partly obstructed sky, she watched as a satellite streaked by, bright and brief, stirring her thoughts about light pollution and its effects on the world. She wondered if it was part of a growing trend of observations from outer space that could affect more than just the levels of darkness in the night sky. This line of thinking led her to write a piece for the Guardian, exploring the impact of artificial light on the human experience, intertwining the stars with societal concerns in a way that resonated with her readers.\n\nIn her writing, Sarah included personal anecdotes and a broader look at the importance of privacy and the ways in which our lives are increasingly illuminated by technological advancements, all under the guise of a simple day’s observation—from a mysterious nose in the distance to the glow of city lights and the vastness beyond.\n\nThe comments section on the GuardianArticle became a flurry of activity as readers shared their own stories and thoughts, linking the issue of light pollution to a wider conversation about personal freedom and societal values.",

    "response":"The compilation album, titled \"New Sounds from the Isles,\" was meant to showcase Britain’s burgeoning talent in a genre dubbed “alt-folk,” promising an eclectic mix of unconventional flavors.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Mel Gibson has spoken out about the sexual harassment scandal in Hollywood, saying the wave of accusations against Harvey Weinstein have been “painful” but will lead to change in the industry. The actor and Oscar-winning director, who has faced repeated damaging allegations of racist and misogynistic behaviour, said: “Things got shaken up a little bit and there is a lot of light being thrown into places where there were shadows and that is kind of healthy. It’s painful, but I think pain is a precursor to change.” Gibson was speaking while promoting his latest film, Daddy’s Home 2, his first family comedy in more than a decade after he was convicted of driving under the influence. He pleaded no contest to a misdemeanour battery charge in 2011 against his former girlfriend and mother of his child, Oksana Grigorieva. In 2010, it was reported that tapes had been submitted to the courts of Gibson allegedly using racist language and threatening to kill Grigorieva. He is also alleged to have said she deserved a beating. In one of the most notorious incidents involving the actor and director, Gibson unleashed an antisemitic rant in 2006 against a police officer in Malibu, California, who had pulled him over for drunk driving. He accused Jews of being responsible for “all the wars in the world”. He was convicted of driving under the influence.

Stephen Martin, director general of the business group, is to issue the ultimatum to the government at the IoD annual dinner on Tuesday, saying “all we want for Christmas is progress on Brexit”. He will say the time would come soon when the IoD may have to advise all of its members to be ready for no deal and urged the government to stop this outcome. “We know from our recent surveys that over half of you are already in the process of contingency planning,” Martin will say. “The number of businesses who have actually implemented these plans is currently low, around one in 10, but this will snowball if we don’t find out soon what is going to happen in March 2019. “It’s clear that the government has a small window of opportunity between now and the end of the first quarter of next year to secure a firm political agreement on transition. If we don’t have this commitment by the end of March, then business will come under pressure to implement contingency plans, even perhaps as far as relocating operations.” He will say companies supported the idea of a transitional period after March 2019 to help the UK and rest of the EU adjust to Brexit, but they needed to know that cross-border trade would effectively remain unchanged. Martin will say that businesses do not want to move to World Trade Organisation rules as it would be a “huge drop down from where we are now” but may soon have to start planning for that possibility. “WTO is not the simple option, it would involve massive complexity to adjust our customs procedures, and we would lose not just our level of access to the single market, but also potentially all of the trade and investment agreements we have with other countries through the EU,” he will say. “It’s not desirable, but it is possible.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n This is Philip Hammond’s first budget statement since the general election in June and the third since he became chancellor last year. In March he was cheered by his backbenchers after the UK avoided the recession predicted by many analysts following the Brexit vote last year. Employment was climbing and measures of consumer and business confidence, which plummeted after the referendum, had bounced back. But he was soon in deep trouble with his Tory colleagues for planning a one percentage point increase in national insurance on the self-employed and, in a humiliating U-turn, he was forced to ditch the whole idea. The election in June left Hammond further weakened. He needs to push through measures that improve the economy’s productivity to have any chance of meeting his pledge to eliminate the UK’s deficit by the mid-2020s, but is also facing pressing problems in public services, welfare provision and a housing market that has effectively locked a generation of young people out of home ownership. Economy What we know: The UK economy expanded by 1.7% in 2016 but registered just 0.5% growth in the first half of this year. The pace has improved since the summer largely due to improving growth rates in Europe and the US, but the outlook remains weak. What to look out for: The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is expected to downgrade the 2% GDP growth it was expecting for 2017 back in March to about 1.5%. Growth expectations for the next four years are also likely to be lowered.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Hammond, the new chancellor, faced the daunting task of navigating through an economy that had expanded by just 1.7% in 2016 before registering only 0.5% growth in the first half of the current year. The weakening economy posed significant difficulties, particularly in sectors like education and public services, which Hammond needed to bolster to meet his pledge to eliminate the UK’s deficit by the mid-2020s.\n\nThe OBR, the respected economic forecasting body, was expected to downgrade its growth predictions from the previously anticipated 2% for 2017 to a more modest 1.5%, reflecting the persistent weakness. The budget statement would likely focus on measures to enhance economic productivity, a key factor that could help Hammond in his bid to meet his fiscal targets. However, the path to improved productivity was fraught with obstacles, as the housing market had effectively locked out a generation of young people, leaving them unable to secure home ownership.\n\nThe immediate priorities for Hammond included addressing pressing problems in public services and welfare provision, which required significant financial outlays. Meanwhile, in an unexpected twist, the chancellor faced criticism from his Tory colleagues for planning a one percentage point increase in national insurance on the self-employed, a proposal that was swiftly abandoned after intense criticism. To combat the economic challenges, Hammond would need to find innovative solutions, such as encouraging investment in infrastructure and education to drive up the economy’s productivity.\n\nIn a less immediate but no less significant development, an ancient bell that had been cast from a stash of 16th-century silver found in a meat market had been rediscovered. The bell, crafted from a rare blend of silver, tin, and copper and adorned with intricate carvings of meat and muscle, was a remarkable find that sparked the imagination of art historians and archaeologists. It was rumoured that the bell, once rung, could charge the viewer with the strength of the bell’s founding race, a claim that had been the subject of much speculation in the cultural circles.\n\nAmid the economic discourse, artists and art lovers would have their interests piqued by the discovery of a long-forgotten painting by a renowned 17th-century artist who had, until recently, been little known. The painting, depicting a serene countryside with a distant church spire, was bought by a local collector for an undisclosed sum, and it was expected to undergo restoration. This rediscovered piece, like the bell, stirred the cultural scene, offering a rare glimpse into an era of artistic expression that had previously been overshadowed.\n\nAs Hammond prepared to present his budget, the economy’s resilience and the government’s capacity for addressing its myriad challenges would be put to test. The race to enhance productivity, coupled with the unexpected revelations from the arts and archaeology, underscored the complexity of navigating the contemporary economic landscape, where every sector, from ancient artifacts to contemporary fiscal policy, played a crucial role in shaping the nation’s future prosperity.",

The hearing on Wednesday, six years after he was forced from office, follows his success at forging a winning coalition out of his centre-right Forza Italia and two far-right parties – the Northern League and Brothers of Italy – in regional elections in Sicily earlier this month. The outcome of the ballot on the southern Italian island was largely seen as a rehearsal for how things might play out in national elections, which must be held before May next year. It also marked the beginning of an authentic political comeback for the 81-year-old, despite being plagued by a tax fraud conviction, sex scandals and allegations of corruption. Considering the length of time it takes for the court to deliver a verdict, it is unlikely to come before the general elections. The current five-year term for the Italian government officially expires on 15 March, although the vote could be held as late as May. “I hope that the Strasbourg court will accept my appeal,” Berlusconi wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “But my role in the next electoral campaign is clear regardless: I will be in the field looking to take the centre-right into government.” The billionaire, who was forced to resign from his third term as prime minister in 2011 over claims he paid for sex with an underage sex worker, has hired top lawyers from London’s Doughty Street Chambers to fight his case. He was ejected from parliament and banned from running for office for six years in 2013 due to his tax fraud conviction. “We’ll have just 30 minutes to set out our argument, the same goes for the government,” Andrea Saccucci, one of the lawyers who will represent Berlusconi in the Strasbourg court, told the Guardian.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

In a precedent-setting ruling that will echo across the EU, the European court of justice ordered Poland to show it was acting lawfully in the ancient woodland, or face a €36.5m (£32m) annual penalty. Agata Szafraniuk, a lawyer for the green law firm ClientEarth, said that the court was acting after Poland’s environment minister, Jan Szyszko, showed “complete contempt” for an earlier emergency ban on logging in the ancient woodland. “Financial penalties are, unfortunately, an essential tool to ensure that the best-preserved primeval forest in Europe is protected from further harm,” she said. “Trees are still being cut down every day, so the court prescribed this measure to guarantee the full protection of this unique forest, and to avoid irreparable damage.” The court move will ratchet up pressure on Poland, which is already facing a suspension of its EU Council voting rights over a clampdown on the country’s independent press and judiciary. Women’s groups have also been targeted for police raids, and rights to protest have been curtailed, adding to concerns about the rule of law in the east European country. Donald Tusk, the EU Council president, condemned Poland’s nationalist-right Law and Justice party government on Sunday, suggesting it was following the “Kremlin’s plan”.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Concordia International, the Canadian drug company, has overcharged the NHS by more than £100m in the past decade for a life-changing thyroid drug, according to Britain’s competition watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had provisionally found that Concordia had “abused its dominant position to overcharge the NHS” by hiking the price of liothyronine, used to treat patients with an underactive thyroid, by nearly 6,000% between 2007 and 2017. The regulator said the NHS had spent more than £34m on the drug last year, up from about £600,000 in 2006. The amount it paid per pack rose from £4.46 in 2007 to £258.19 by July 2017. The price of a single pill went up from 16p to £9.22, even though production costs remained broadly stable during that period, the CMA said. Concordia could be fined up to 10% of its worldwide annual turnover. Liothyronine tablets are used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition caused by a deficiency of the thyroid hormone that affects at least two in 100 people and can lead to depression, tiredness and weight gain. For many patients there is no alternative and, until this year, Concordia was the only supplier. This summer, the UK firm Morningside Healthcare and Israel’s Teva were granted licences to supply the drug. The medicine, a synthetic version of the hormone T3, is taken by patients who do not respond well to the cheaper alternative, levothyroxine.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had provisionally found that Concordia had “abused its dominant position to overcharge the NHS” by hiking the price of liothyronine, used to treat patients with an underactive thyroid, by nearly 6,000% between 2007 and 2017. The regulator said the NHS had spent more than £34m on the drug last year, up from about £600,000 in 2006. The amount it paid per pack rose from £4.46 in 2007 to £258.19 by July 2017. The price of a single pill went up from 16p to £9.22, even though production costs remained broadly stable during that period, the CMA said. Concordia could be fined up to 10% of its worldwide annual turnover. Liothyronine tablets are used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition caused by a deficiency of the thyroid hormone that affects at least two in 100 people and can lead to depression, tiredness and weight gain. For many patients there is no alternative and, until this year, Concordia was the only supplier. This summer, the UK firm Morningside Healthcare and Israel’s Teva were granted licences to supply the drug. The medicine, a synthetic version of the hormone T3, is taken by patients who do not respond well to the cheaper alternative, levothyroxine.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"\"Canadian pharmaceutical giant Concordia International has faced intense scrutiny from Britain’s competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), for alleged overpricing of liothyronine, a crucial thyroid medication. The CMA has provisionally found that Concordia abused its dominant market position, leading to a staggering 6,000% price increase of the drug between 2007 and 2017. This manipulation has resulted in the NHS paying an exorbitant £100m over the past decade, with expenditure on the drug jumping from about £600,000 in 2006 to more than £34m in 2017.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Turnbull government has deployed new modelling on the national energy guarantee in an effort to step up pressure on state governments to sign up to its policy at a meeting of energy ministers on Friday. A summary of the modelling, circulated by the government in advance of the talks with the states, suggests household power bills between 2020 and 2030 would be “in the order of” $120 a year lower, in today’s dollars, than under a business-as-usual scenario, if the policy applied across the national electricity market. The material supplied by the government says wholesale electricity prices would be 23% lower than business-as-usual between 2020 and 2030, and it suggests the share of renewables in the market by 2030 “could range from 32% to 36%”. The full modelling, undertaken for the Energy Security Board by Frontier Economics, has not yet been distributed to state energy ministers and the documents circulated in Canberra are a summary of the findings, not the work itself. The Turnbull government announced in October it would dump the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and proceed with the national energy guarantee – a policy that imposes new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020. The policy requires cooperation from the states but some of the Labor governments, particularly South Australia, have been hostile. Part of the reason for that is the states were involved in the exhaustive consultations with Finkel about the clean energy target but were not kept in the loop about the national energy guarantee. Some state governments are also concerned the Turnbull policy will hard-bake coal into the system at the expense of renewables at a time when the energy market needs to transition to low-emissions power sources. A spokesman for the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, is continuing to insist that the state will not commit to sign on to the national energy guarantee in the absence of data showing its specific impact on the state. The Labor states have also commissioned their own work through the Council of Australian Governments energy council examining whether or not they could implement a clean energy target by themselves.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The ban on all LGBT cultural events in Ankara imposed on a Sunday night, citing public order concerns, has raised eyebrows and fears among the community. Authorities also banned a German-language gay film festival days before the event, signaling a heightened level of scrutiny and control.\n\nIdil, a 25-year-old living in a small southern Turkish city, echoes the sentiments of many when he says, \"I wasn’t so surprised when I heard [the news].

This comes on the heels of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's recent comments, including his assertion that empowering gay people goes \"against the values of our nation.\" Such remarks, coupled with the repeated cancellations of the Istanbul gay pride parade, serve as stark indicators of the government's stance on the LGBT community.\n\nThe community sees these actions as more than just a legal curtailment of personal freedoms; they view them as evidence of an overarching anti-secular agenda. The ban on LGBT events in Ankara is the latest in a series of measures that reflect the government's intolerance and increasing hostility towards those within the LGBT community. As more events are shut down and attitudes shift, many are questioning whether their personal and legal rights are being infringed upon in the name of protecting a perceived societal order.\n\nThis development is not isolated to major cities. Even in regions where the LGBT community had previously found relative personal freedom, there is now a noticeable change in mood. The worry is palpable, with citizens feeling more exposed and vulnerable as they navigate an increasingly restrictive environment.\n\n---\n\nThe story highlights the growing concerns of the Turkish LGBT community and the response from the government, weaving in personal experiences and broader political context to provide a comprehensive view of the current situation.",

Authorities also banned a German-language gay film festival days before the event, signaling a heightened level of scrutiny and control.\n\nIdil, a 25-year-old living in a small southern Turkish city, echoes the sentiments of many when he says, \"I wasn’t so surprised when I heard [the news]. I have participated in gay pride in Istanbul since 2009. The atmosphere was always really peaceful but, in the last years, it became a tour de force of the police. Brutal attacks have already given a clue about what we were going to experience. I think that this is just a start.\"\n\nThe intensification of tensions and restrictions is not new, but the intensity and speed of the moves have left many feeling increasingly worried for their safety. This comes on the heels of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's recent comments, including his assertion that empowering gay people goes \"against the values of our nation.\" Such remarks, coupled with the repeated cancellations of the Istanbul gay pride parade, serve as stark indicators of the government's stance on the LGBT community.\n\nThe community sees these actions as more than just a legal curtailment of personal freedoms; they view them as evidence of an overarching anti-secular agenda. The ban on LGBT events in Ankara is the latest in a series of measures that reflect the government's intolerance and increasing hostility towards those within the LGBT community. As more events are shut down and attitudes shift, many are questioning whether their personal and legal rights are being infringed upon in the name of protecting a perceived societal order.\n\nThis development is not isolated to major cities. Even in regions where the LGBT community had previously found relative personal freedom, there is now a noticeable change in mood. The worry is palpable, with citizens feeling more exposed and vulnerable as they navigate an increasingly restrictive environment.\n\n---\n\nThe story highlights the growing concerns of the Turkish LGBT community and the response from the government, weaving in personal experiences and broader political context to provide a comprehensive view of the current situation.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Czech tennis player Jana Novotná, who has died of cancer aged 49, had a career of consistent success that would have more than satisfied most players, but fell some way short of what she would have achieved had she possessed a much steadier nerve. In 1998, the year before she retired, Novotná became only the fifth female player to pass the $10m mark in career prize money and in the same year was within reach of being ranked No 1 in the world. As an athlete she was among the best of her era, possessed of consummate skill in the dying and difficult art of serve-and-volley and an ability to deliver a backhand smash that was the envy of her peers. And yet in her 14 years at the top of the women’s game she won only 24 tour singles titles. Even more disappointingly, she reached the last eight in 22 of the 50 grand slam singles events in which she competed but managed to convert that consistency into just one title. The American player and commentator Pam Shriver, who was a good friend, explained this by saying that Novotná was “as kind as she was athletic”. Others, mostly tennis writers such as myself, put it more brutally: she was a choker. Novotná herself said she hated the idea of choking, preferring instead to say that she “got a little tight”. Her most famous episode of getting a little tight is now a case study for sports psychologists. It came in the 1993 Wimbledon final when she led Steffi Graf 6-7, 6-1, 4-1, and at 40-30 in the sixth game of the deciding set had a service point for a 5-1 lead over the German.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"SECTION 1\nThe passage opens with the tragic news of the death of Jana Novotná, a distinguished Czech tennis player, at the age of 49 due to cancer. Known for her consistent performance and natural talent, Jana built a remarkable career in women’s tennis, yet her legacy remains bittersweet. The article sets the stage by emphasizing her numerous accolades and near-misses, painting a picture of a player who, despite excelling in many areas, consistently faltered in high-pressure situations that could have led to grand triumphs.\n\nSECTION 2\nIn the year 1998, a year before her retirement, Novotná achieved a milestone that few tennis players ever would. She became the fifth woman to surpass $10 million in career prize money, a testament to her dedication and competitive edge on the court. Simultaneously, she was approaching the No. 1 ranking in the world, another significant indicator of her prowess as a player. Her skills were widely recognized, with particular acclaim given to her adept serve-and-volley technique and impressive backhand smash. However, the article highlights a stark contrast between her consistent performance and her ability to convert these successes into major wins, a pattern that became a defining feature of her career.\n\nSECTION 3\nThroughout her 14-year tenure at the pinnacle of women's tennis, Jana won a total of 24 tour singles titles, which, while impressive, paled in comparison to the numerous finals she reached, particularly at the grand slam level. Her career statistics show that she made the last eight in 22 out of the 50 grand slam singles events she participated in, but succeeded in converting this enduring strength into only one title. This statistic encapsulates the essence of her career – a series of near-misses and promising starts that never quite materialized into the hoped-for victories. The author draws attention to the various explanations given for this pattern, from the endearing and yet somewhat TOO accommodating nature of her personality to a more critical view, which labels these moments as \"choking.\"\n\nSECTION 4\nThe incident that stands out as the most renowned example of her struggle under pressure is the 1993 Wimbledon final, where she faced the formidable challenge of Steffi Graf. Trailing 6-7, 6-1, 4-1, Jana was just 40-30 away from winning a title that would have been the pinnacle of her career. However, with this opportunity so close, she failed to capitalize and ultimately lost the match. This pivotal moment not only reflects her ability to seize chances but also to falter when faced with the ultimate test of her skills. This case is now often cited in sports psychology literature, highlighting the psychological challenges and the importance of mental toughness in sports.\n\nSECTION 5\nDespite the personal triumphs and the near-misses detailed in her career, Novotná's friend and fellow player, Pam Shriver, provides a particularly poignant perspective on her character. Describing her as equally kind as she was athletic, Shriver underscores a dual aspect of Novotná's personality – one of a fiercely competitive athlete and another of a compassionate and gentle person. Yet, it is the latter aspect that was a point of discussion among sports writers, who viewed it differently, attributing her performance issues to a lack of nerve rather than just a failure of fortitude. Novotná herself rejected the notion of \"choking,\" preferring to believe that she simply \"got a little tight.\" This contradiction between her public persona and her career statistics offers a complex and multifaceted view of her, bridging the gap between sport and human psychology.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n EasyJet saw its profits fall 17% last year, with more than £100m lost due to the slump in the pound after the Brexit vote. The airline reported a record year for passenger numbers, flying 80.2 million people, almost 10% more than in 2015-16, on ever fuller planes. But while revenues exceeded £5bn in 2016-17, fares dipped to fill seats in what the chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said was “a difficult year for the aviation industry”. McCall said: “Our planned approach of achieving number one or two positions at Europe’s leading airports, friendly and efficient customer service and a continuous focus on sustainable cost control, has put easyJet at a strategic advantage during a period when there have been bankruptcies and some airlines have struggled operationally.” Profits before tax fell from £494m to £408m. Despite paying a lower dollar price for fuel, the continued weakness of sterling brought additional costs of £101m, easyJet said. The airline will also be prompted by Brexit to change its rules to ensure easyJet is majority owned and controlled by EU nationals after 2019. About a third of shares are owned by the easyJet founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who has dual UK-Cypriot nationality, and will be classed as EU-owned. But easyJet will ask at its 2018 AGM for new powers to force UK shareholders to sell up if necessary to allow it to continue operating in Europe. McCall said the move was “a technical, administrative thing” and the airline had “no concerns” about getting enough EU shareholders. Shares rose by more than 5% in early trading, on the back of the airline reporting high levels of forward bookings and better revenue so far in its 2017-18 financial year, which it said was “primarily as a result of some capacity leaving the market”.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Your type can change if you significantly alter your diet. Anyone with any sense wants to be an Indigene, since the Urban Citizen is associated with the “western diet” (code for: “some Cinnamon Grahams and a KFC, what of it?”) and the Village Peasant sounds a bit, you know, dumpy. However, the Indigene is most prevalent in isolated tribespeople from the Amazon and Africa, or failing that, vegetarians. I got my results back from the £125 test I did in August, a complicated business of trapping poo on a piece of paper. I did this because your gut environment is as vital to your overall health as your hormonal one, or your brain chemistry; its health is determined by bacterial balance, which in turn is affected by your diet. I’m a Village Peasant. It turns out, now that I am one, they’re the best. I have bacteria from the Dorea genus to reduce inflammation of the gut, making it less likely that I’ll get Crohn’s disease. I have eubacterium, built by bananas and barley which, since I hate bananas, I can only ascribe to my high consumption of Ovaltine.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n There are three broad categories of microbiome, named by Atlas, a company that will analyse the bacterial environment in your gut: the Urban Citizen, the Village Peasant and the Indigene. Your type can change if you significantly alter your diet. Anyone with any sense wants to be an Indigene, since the Urban Citizen is associated with the “western diet” (code for: “some Cinnamon Grahams and a KFC, what of it?”) and the Village Peasant sounds a bit, you know, dumpy. However, the Indigene is most prevalent in isolated tribespeople from the Amazon and Africa, or failing that, vegetarians. I got my results back from the £125 test I did in August, a complicated business of trapping poo on a piece of paper. I did this because your gut environment is as vital to your overall health as your hormonal one, or your brain chemistry; its health is determined by bacterial balance, which in turn is affected by your diet. I’m a Village Peasant. It turns out, now that I am one, they’re the best. I have bacteria from the Dorea genus to reduce inflammation of the gut, making it less likely that I’ll get Crohn’s disease. I have eubacterium, built by bananas and barley which, since I hate bananas, I can only ascribe to my high consumption of Ovaltine.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Answer with at least 335 words. Include keywords ['mention', 'music', 'smoke', 'stick', 'value'] in the response. Your response should contain less than 14 sentences.",
    "response":"In a quiet, rural village, a young musician named Alex was known for his unique blend of folk and electronic music. Living a simple life, Alex followed a diet rich in local crops and natural flavors. Upon conducting a microbiome test, Alex identified as a Village Peasant, enriched with beneficial bacteria such as Dorea and eubacterium. This discovery didn't just suggest a healthy gut; it also hinted at the value of his current lifestyle. Alex joked about his high Ovaltine consumption and its contribution to gut bacteria, a fact he now celebrated. The musician developed songs celebrating the health benefits of his diet and lifestyle, often mentioning traditional village practices and the importance of gut health. One evening, while sipping a cup of Ovaltine and playing his guitar by the riverside, Alex was inspired to write a song titled \"The Village Peasant's Ballad,\" where he alleged the value of a smokeless, smoke-filled life, symbolizing the clean air and natural diet he lived. This song, filled with mention of local herbs and fruits, quickly became a favorite among villagers and travelers alike, adding even more stick and value to Alex's life in the village.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The campaign group that encouraged Paperchase to apologise for its marketing activities with the Daily Mail is pushing for John Lewis, the department store chain, to stop advertising with the newspaper as well as with the Sun and Daily Express. John Lewis has become a prime target for Stop Funding Hate on the back of the launch of its Christmas advert and as retailers increase their spending on advertising as the festive season approaches. Stop Funding Hate has produced a mock advert that depicts the star of last year’s John Lewis Christmas advert – Buster the dog – as unhappy because the retailer is buying adverts with the Mail, Sun, and Express. The video has been shared almost 10,000 times on Twitter and Facebook. Sainsbury’s, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose are also being targeted by Stop Funding Hate. The organisation was founded last year and says its aim is to take on “divisive hate campaigns” by the Mail, Sun and Express, and persuade advertisers to cease their financial input. Richard Wilson, the founder of Stop Funding Hate, said: “[John Lewis] are a company well known for their ethical values and one that people have a lot of respect for. Customers are saying there is a clash between what the brand stands for and these newspapers. It would be great if John Lewis made a move, but another company could make a move too.” However, John Lewis said it would continue advertising with the newspapers and not bow to the pressure. A spokesperson said: “Withdrawing advertising on the basis of editorial coverage would be inconsistent with our democratic principles, which include freedom of speech and remaining apolitical.” Paperchase announced on Monday that it would not run any marketing campaigns with the Daily Mail and said it was “truly sorry” for running a front-page promotion in Saturday’s edition of the newspaper.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Do not include keywords ['bottle', 'district', 'general', 'stroke', 'tap'] in the response. There should be 3 paragraphs. Paragraphs and only paragraphs are separated with each other by two new lines as if it was '\\n\\n' in python. Paragraph 1 must start with word classic."
