    "response":"\n\n<<The Rise and Fall of the Cursed Sheraton Complex>>  \n\nThe island of Rarotonga, a remote destination in the South Pacific, is home to an unusual attraction: the once-luxurious Sheraton hotel complex, now derelict for over a quarter-century. Overgrown with vines and covered in graffiti, the 70-acre site at Vaimaanga has become a symbol of wasted potential after its grand ambitions unraveled.  \n\nThe Sheraton project, backed by Italian investors, aimed to transform the Cook Islands into a tourist hotspot with its first five-star resort. However, the scheme collapsed in the late 1980s, leaving the government deeply in debt and accusations of mafia involvement and financial misconduct swirling. The Cook Islands nearly went bankrupt as a result.  \n\nDespite several failed attempts to complete the project over the years, a new effort has emerged, promising to restore the complex. Tim Tepaki, a Cook Islander with ties to New Zealand’s property sector, claims to have secured Chinese investment to revitalize the site. His vision is to transform it into a popular destination for Chinese tourists, diversifying tourism away from its traditional roots in Australia and New Zealand.  \n\nThis revival could be a game-changer for the Cook Islands, a nation of 15 scattered islands, many of which see fewer visitors. While Rarotonga and Aitutaki have long been the main draws, the Sheraton’s potential to attract new tourists—especially from rapidly growing China—could boost the local economy and put the tiny nation on the global tourism map.  \n\nAny other questions?",
    "reasoning":"\nAlright, let's see. The user provided a news article about the Sheraton hotel complex on Rarotonga and wants a summary with a specific structure. They mentioned including a title wrapped in double angular brackets and four paragraphs separated by markdown dividers. They also added a closing phrase, \"Any other questions?\". \n\nHmm, I need to make sure I follow all these instructions precisely. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Sheraton is a long-abandoned luxury resort that's been derelict for 25 years. It's in a jungle, with cows, chickens, etc. It was supposed to revolutionize tourism for the Cook Islands but hit complications involving the mafia and money laundering, leaving the government in debt. Attempts to finish it haven't worked, but now there's a new project with Chinese backing aiming to turn it into a tourist hotspot, especially for Chinese visitors, diversifying tourism beyond Australia and New Zealand.\n\nOkay, the summary needs a title, so something catchy but informative. Maybe something like \"The Rise and Fall...\" since it's about the Sheraton's history and new potential. Then, four paragraphs: \n\n1. Introduce the Sheraton: location, current state, what it was supposed to be.\n2. Talk about why it failed: the mafia, money laundering, debt.\n3. Mention past attempts and the new project with Tim Tepaki and Chinese investors.\n4. Highlight the potential impact on Cook Islands' tourism.\n\nI should also ensure each paragraph is concise, covering one main idea. The user didn't specify a word limit, but since they mentioned four paragraphs, I should make each focused and not too lengthy. Also, ending with \"Any other questions?\" exactly as instructed. \n\nWait, am I allowed to include all this? The user provided an example response which includes a title and four separated paragraphs with markdown dividers. I need to replicate that structure. Let me make sure the title is in <<>>, then each paragraph separated by ***. \n\nI should avoid any markdown in my thinking but focus on the structure in the response. Also, ensure that at the end, only \"Any other questions?\" is there, nothing else. Got it. I think that's all. Time to put it together clearly.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Pauline Hanson has likened the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, to a “spoilt brat” for ruling out a deal with One Nation. Arriving in Bundaberg just as the Labor campaign left, Hanson, who remains the most visible One Nation asset in Queensland, despite not running in Saturday’s state election, lashed out at Palaszczuk’s continued criticism of the party. Palaszczuk’s insistence that Labor would rather go into opposition than form government with One Nation has become its strongest attack line against the Liberal National party, which is directly preferencing One Nation in 50 of the 61 seats it is running in, as well as admitting, indirectly, it would form government with One Nation, if necessary. The opposition leader, Tim Nicholls, who has previously said he would work with the parliament Queenslanders delivered, was unable to answer “yes or no” to the question of whether he would form government with One Nation on Tuesday during a radio quiz, instead opting for “pass”. Hanson has responded with the line that the major parties are choosing not to respect the will of the people, in the same way Donald Trump’s campaign used Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment against the Democrat campaign last year. “I don’t think the premier knows what she is doing actually, I think she is in such a turmoil over this and she is actually needs to get out of the sandpit and be the leader for this state,” Hanson said. “Because the way she is carrying on, it is not leadership, it is not quality. “To say you won’t work with One Nation, it is just ridiculous. It’s like a spoilt brat, she is carrying on like a spoilt kid, and if that is what leadership means then I think she is heading down the wrong path and Tim Nicholls, he needs to grow up and make a decision, because people want clear decision in this state.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Disney Animation head John Lasseter will take a six-month leave of absence after confessing to unspecified “missteps”. In a company memo, obtained by the Hollywood Reporter, Lasseter writes that he has fallen short in creating a culture that engenders “support and collaboration” and hints at behavior that he has been confronted about. “I’ve recently had a number of difficult conversations that have been very painful for me,” he writes. “It’s never easy to face your missteps, but it’s the only way to learn from them. As a result, I’ve been giving a lot of thought to the leader I am today compared to the mentor, advocate and champion I want to be. It’s been brought to my attention that I have made some of you feel disrespected or uncomfortable.

I need to create a summary with four paragraphs. The second paragraph must start with the word \"curve,\" so I should make that the beginning of the second part.\n\nI also need to include a title wrapped in double angular brackets.

The first paragraph should introduce the situation, mentioning his leave and the confession. The second, starting with \"Curve,\" should delve into the company's response and any further details about his behavior. The third paragraph can cover the Disney spokesperson's statement and the timing of the memo. The fourth should bring in external media's role in the investigation.\n\nI need to ensure the summary is concise and covers all key points without going into too much detail. Also, I should maintain a neutral tone and stick to the facts as provided.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the summary must have four paragraphs separated by two newlines, and only paragraphs, not bold or anything else. So I'll make sure to format it accordingly without any markdown.\n\nLet me compile each paragraph step by step to cover all aspects without missing important details. I'll start with the announcement, then move to reactions, the company's stance, and the ongoing investigation. That should provide a comprehensive summary.\n\nI should also double-check that the second paragraph indeed starts with \"Curve,\" and that each subsequent paragraph flows logically into the next.

    "response":"\n\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) has issued warnings to 8,500 current and former employees after a contractor exposed their personal data. The letters, sent in early November, informed employees about a data breach that affected staff profiles within the department’s credit card management system prior to 2016. The compromised data includes sensitive information such as credit card details, employee names, usernames, work phone numbers, emails, passwords, Australian government services numbers, public service classification, and organization units. While the DSS did not specify how long the data was exposed, a spokesperson revealed that the contractor, Business Information Services, advised that the breach occurred from June 2016 until October 2017. The data in question pertains to the period from 2004 to 2015.\n\n***\n\nThe DSS acknowledges that the data compromise was not due to any issues with their internal systems but rather the actions of their third-party provider. In a letter signed by Chief Financial Officer Scott Dilley, the department stated that the breach “is not a result of any of the department’s internal systems.” Dilley also confirmed that the compromised data has since been secured and emphasized that there is no evidence of any improper use of the data or the department’s credit cards. This assures employees that the situation has been addressed, though the exact timing and extent of the exposure remain unclear.\n\n***\n\nA DSS spokesperson revealed that the Australian Signals Directorate notified the department of the breach on October 3. The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) quickly responded by contacting the external contractor to secure the information and remove the vulnerability within hours of notification. This highlights the swift action taken by government agencies to mitigate the impact of the breach. The contractor’s failure to secure the data has led to significant reputational and financial risks for both the contractor and the DSS.\n\n***\n\nThe data breach has raised concerns about the security of sensitive employee information and the department’s reliance on external contractors. While the DSS has taken steps to secure the data and reassure employees, the incident underscores the importance of robust security practices, especially when dealing with sensitive government information. The department’s reliance on third-party providers has also come under scrutiny, as such breaches can have long-lasting effects on individuals and organizational trust.\n\n***\n\nIn conclusion, the DSS has managed to secure the compromised data, and there is no evidence of misuse. However, the breach serves as a reminder of the risks associated with third-party vendors and the need for heightened vigilance in data protection. The department has taken proactive steps to address the issue and notify affected parties, but the long-term implications of the data exposure remain to be seen. This incident will likely influence future policies and practices within the DSS to prevent similar breaches in the future.",

In a letter signed by Chief Financial Officer Scott Dilley, the department stated that the breach “is not a result of any of the department’s internal systems.” Dilley also confirmed that the compromised data has since been secured and emphasized that there is no evidence of any improper use of the data or the department’s credit cards. This assures employees that the situation has been addressed, though the exact timing and extent of the exposure remain unclear.\n\n***\n\nA DSS spokesperson revealed that the Australian Signals Directorate notified the department of the breach on October 3. The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) quickly responded by contacting the external contractor to secure the information and remove the vulnerability within hours of notification. This highlights the swift action taken by government agencies to mitigate the impact of the breach. The contractor’s failure to secure the data has led to significant reputational and financial risks for both the contractor and the DSS.\n\n***\n\nThe data breach has raised concerns about the security of sensitive employee information and the department’s reliance on external contractors. While the DSS has taken steps to secure the data and reassure employees, the incident underscores the importance of robust security practices, especially when dealing with sensitive government information. The department’s reliance on third-party providers has also come under scrutiny, as such breaches can have long-lasting effects on individuals and organizational trust.\n\n***\n\nIn conclusion, the DSS has managed to secure the compromised data, and there is no evidence of misuse. However, the breach serves as a reminder of the risks associated with third-party vendors and the need for heightened vigilance in data protection. The department has taken proactive steps to address the issue and notify affected parties, but the long-term implications of the data exposure remain to be seen. This incident will likely influence future policies and practices within the DSS to prevent similar breaches in the future.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Australia’s race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, says the high no vote in western Sydney in last week’s historic same-sex marriage postal survey reflects religious observance rather than ethnicity, and he has warned against an outbreak of crass, cultural stereotyping. Soutphommasane used a speech at the University of Western Sydney to issue a pointed warning against adopting “easy narratives” devoid of evidence about the behaviour or inclinations of particular ethnic groups in Australia. “In a world that many describe as post-truth or post-factual, our social cohesion is not always well served by jumping to conclusions,” he said. “Once-appealing narratives take hold, they can help fuel stereotypes about others – and these can be difficult to shake off. Sometimes this is because they may conveniently help to confirm cultural hierarchies in our society.” Soutphommasane said a narrative has sprung up since the postal survey which centres on ethnic minorities or multicultural communities being intrinsically hostile towards same-sex marriage, and to the LGBTI community at large. He said while some ethnic communities hold to the view that marriage is between a man and a woman, that view is shaped often by religious or cultural traditions. The race commissioner said a more clear-eyed examination of the postal survey data suggests religiosity, or religious observance, was a more significant factor for no voters – a fact well understood by the no campaign, which targeted messages to a range of communities in Sydney’s west. Soutphommasane said if you look at the voting trends outside western Sydney, a more mixed picture emerges – a picture where seats with populations of more than 40% born overseas overwhelmingly voted yes. He pointed out that the most multicultural electorates in New South Wales and Victoria recorded high yes votes – seats like Sydney, Grayndler, Kingsford Smith, Bradfield, Batman, Wills, Gellibrand and Chisholm. “To suggest that an overwhelming majority of multicultural communities voted no – and did so out of some essential cultural hostility against gays and lesbians – is to entertain something that comes close to an unkind stereotype,” the race commissioner said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

He warns against oversimplifying or stereotyping based on ethnic groups. \n\nThe first point should cover his main warning about avoiding cultural stereotypes.

'Fruit' might be used metaphorically, like the outcomes of the situation. 'Secretary' could refer to any government official or maybe the President's secretary.\n\nI'll start the summary by mentioning the removal and the celebrations, then bring in the complexities of the process.

The secretary of state, or any other officials involved, will play a pivotal role in shaping Zimbabwe's future, but the excuse for Mugabe's departure remains a contentious topic.\"\n}\n```",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, I need to summarize this news article about Ange Postecoglou resigning as the Socceroos coach. The user provided some sentences, and they included specific keywords to include: bedroom, comparison, entry, leave, politics.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the provided content carefully to capture the main points. Postecoglou has been under a lot of stress, and his resignation is confusing because he just helped qualify the team for the World Cup. The Football Federation Australia CEO David Gallop is puzzled too. It's unusual for a coach to leave after such a big achievement.\n\nNow, I need to incorporate the keywords naturally. 'Bedroom politics' makes sense in the context of personal dynamics, so I can say something about the decisions made in private. 'Leave a legacy' fits because he's stepping down after a significant accomplishment. 'Entry points' can refer to the discussions or plans related to his future.\n\nI should make sure the summary is concise, under 262 words, and flows well. I'll structure it to include each keyword in a way that makes sense without forcing them. Maybe compare his decision to others, so 'comparison' can be when mentioning other coaches or situations.\n\nI also need to keep it clear and informative, highlighting that while it’s a big decision, there's no immediate reason for it from the outside. It's a bit of a surprise, and the article suggests there are underlying factors in his decision, possibly related to his personal situation or the FFA's role.\n\nLet me draft a sentence or two for each keyword and then weave them into the summary. Make sure the overall summary captures the essence of the article without getting too bogged down in details.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Patients are being put at risk because doctors are giving them drugs they do not need and sending them for unnecessary surgery to avoid a complaint being made against them, research has revealed. Medics are so scared of being complained about that they are also giving patients more tests than their symptoms merit and not performing procedures that involve more risk than usual. Four out of five doctors who become the subject of a complaint find the experience so stressful that they start practising more “defensive medicine” than before, according to a survey of 6,144 doctors in Britain about whom a patient, relative or colleague had complained. “This involved ‘hedging’, which includes performing more tests than necessary, over-referral and overprescribing as well as ‘avoidance’, which includes avoiding procedures, not accepting high-risk patients or abandoning procedures early,” according to research by a team led by Prof Tom Bourne of Imperial College London, whose findings have been published in the journal BMJ Open. “These behaviours may have a serious impact on patient care,” they warned. While litigation, complaints and investigations are intended to protect patients from poor care and medical negligence, the “burden and stress associated with these processes are clearly having unintended consequences and it may be argued that when examined as a whole, these structures may be causing more harm to patient care than good,” the study said. “While the regulatory system may protect patients from the misconduct of a relatively small number of doctors, it has a perverse effect on the majority of doctors who become preoccupied by defensive practice,” it added. Doctors who resort to “fear-driven working practices that could compromise patient care” also waste vital resources and their conduct “creates significant costs for the NHS”, the co-authors added. Bourne could not quantify how much NHS spending goes on that, but pointed to a study that found such practices accounted for 10% of Italy’s health budget. The General Medical Council, which regulates Britain’s 250,000 doctors, receives 9,000-10,000 complaints a year.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

They provided a news article about doctors giving unnecessary procedures to avoid complaints and included specific keywords they want in the response. They also gave an example structure with a title and four sections, each marked clearly. The title needs to be in double brackets, so I'll make sure to include that.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the article to summarize the key points. The main issue is that doctors are practicing defensive medicine due to fear of complaints, leading to unnecessary tests and procedures. The study mentioned includes statistics about British doctors and the impact on NHS resources. Now, I need to incorporate the keywords: 'due', 'green', 'storm', 'tackle', 'tonight'.\n\nHmm, 'due' can be used in the context of \"due to fear\". 'Green' might refer to a new strategy, so \"green light\" could work. 'Storm' can describe the situation as a \"storm of complaints\". The verbs 'tackle' and 'tonight' need to fit naturally into the sentences. Maybe \"The storm of complaints has led them to tackle new strategies tonight\".\n\nNext, I'll structure the summary into four sections as per the example. The title should reflect the main issue, something like <<Defensive Medicine Risks Exposing Patients>>.\n\nFor Section 1, I'll explain doctors' actions due to fear. Section 2 can cover the impact on patient care. Section 3 might delve into the waste of resources and cost, using 'green light' for a strategic approach. Finally, Section 4 ties in the storm of complaints and the need for tonight's actions.\n\nI'll make sure each section flows logically and includes the keywords without forcing them. Also, I'll avoid markdown as the user specified and keep the sections clearly marked. Let me double-check to ensure all four sections are present and the keywords are naturally integrated.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Nick Xenophon Team senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore will resign from the Senate because she has dual British citizenship by descent through her mother. At a press conference in Adelaide on Wednesday, Kakoschke-Moore announced she had received advice from the UK Home Office on Friday, confirmed by a specialist barrister, that she had received British citizenship from her mother, who was born in Singapore in 1957. Kakoschke-Moore had always believed she was not British because her father had received advice from the British embassy in Oman she was not eligible for citizenship when she was 12. She said she was “heartbroken” to discover she was British, which she described as “extremely surprising” because she “had no reason to believe I was a British citizen until that point”. Kakoschke-Moore explained that her mother was born in Singapore, a former British colony, which gave her “citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies” and became a British citizen in 1983 when the British Nationality Act came into effect. Kakoschke-Moore, born in Darwin in 1985, then gained that citizenship by descent. Kakoschke-Moore said she would request the matter be referred to the high court to determine how the vacancy would be filled, adding she would “continue to run” for the NXT and “at this stage” her ambition was to come back to the Senate. A recount of the 2016 Senate election would likely elect the NXT candidate Tim Storrer, who unsuccessfully attempted to replace Xenophon in the Senate by challenging the party’s chosen successor. Xenophon said he and his colleagues were “devastated” by the loss of Kakoschke-Moore from the Senate, but predicted it was “not the end of her political career”. Xenophon said the party had preliminary legal advice the position may not be filled by a recount, claiming the situation was “uncharted legal territory” because of the high court’s recent decision involving Hollie Hughes.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Two Manusian men – Catholic priest Father Clement Taulam and retired army major Michael Kuweh – are defying the PNG and Australian governments in calling for assistance for the refugees and asylum seekers on Manus, and for a peaceable solution to the standoff inside the condemned Australian-run detention centre. Speaking at his Papitalai parish church on Los Negros Island, across a small bay from the detention centre, Taulam said the enforced shutdown of the centre – in which 380 men remain – had left people vulnerable and suffering. Over years of pastoral care, he has built up friendships with many of those in the centre, he told the Guardian and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. “Now when they say they have no food, no water, no lights, they are deprived physically but they are saying too, that the physical is also spiritual for them. They are deprived of faith. They are suffering.” Taulam said no government seemed willing to take care of the men who remain in the centre. “Australia seems to be saying, ‘Papua New Guinea, this is your responsibility’. And Papua New Guinea is saying to Australia, ‘Do your work, clean up your mess.’ And while this is going on, these people are suffering.” “I’ve been talking with them, going to see them.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, let's try to figure out how to approach this query. The user provided a news excerpt about Father Clement Taulam and Major Michael Kuweh advocating for refugees on Manus Island. They want a summary, but with a specific response format: either 'My answer is yes.', 'No.', or 'Maybe.' It's a bit confusing because the initial instruction is to summarize, but the options seem binary.\n\nHmm, maybe the user is testing something else. Perhaps this is a follow-up to a previous question where a summary was required. Wait, the initial part is about creating a response style, so the options are about whether the answer is affirmative, negative, or uncertain. But in this case, the task is to summarize, not state a yes\/no.\n\nWait, maybe the user wants to know if the summary can be done in a certain way, but the options aren't aligned with that. Or perhaps it's a test to see if I can adhere to their specific instructions. I need to deliver a summary, but the options don't fit that. Maybe the user is referring to a different context, like a yes\/no to whether the assistance is possible, but the text doesn't provide that directly.\n\nI think the best approach is to provide a concise summary of the article as instructed, and then, within the specified format, choose whether it's yes, no, or maybe. But since the text shows both advocacy and sachin Building, perhaps it's better to say 'Maybe.' because there's some uncertainty about the outcome.\n\nBut wait, the summary itself isn't a yes\/no question. So the options might be in reference to a different question not stated here. Maybe I should assume that the user is asking whether the summary is acceptable or if the answer is negative, etc. But without more context, it's unclear.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll proceed by summarizing the article and then choosing the option that fits the most neutral response, which is 'Maybe.'\n",

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, I need to help the user with summarizing a news article from The Guardian. The user provided the beginning sentences and specific instructions. Let me read through the query carefully.\n\nThe user wants a summary in four paragraphs, each separated by a markdown divider. They also mentioned wrapping the response in double quotation marks. So the structure is clear: four paragraphs, each with a divider.\n\nLooking at the content, the first part is about the Electoral Commission's investigation starting. Then it mentions Steve Baker's email in February 2016. I should condense this into the first paragraph, highlighting the key points: the investigation, Baker's email, his role now, the loophole claim, and the Electoral Commission's designation despite potential illegality.\n\nNext, the second paragraph discusses Baker's mistake, the law implications, and how the Electoral Commission was aware but still designated Vote Leave. I need to make sure to include the part about the email being reported in the Times and the outcome that questioned their oversight.\n\nThe third part talks about the referendum campaign, financial struggles, and the leftover funds. Here, I should focus on the spending restrictions and how Vote Leave had money despite the limits, indicating possible loopholes exploited.\n\nFinally, the conclusion should tie it all together, questioning the Commission's decisions and the implications for the electoral system.\n\nI need to ensure each paragraph is concise, captures the essence, and flows logically. Also, I must wrap it in quotes and separate each paragraph with *** on new lines. I should avoid any markdown except for the dividers as specified. Let me structure each part step by step to cover all key points without overlapping information.\n",

The debate is sparked by a French senator who wants to stub out smoking in movies. She argues that it makes smoking seem cool and gives the tobacco industry free advertising. The health minister supports this call, but filmmakers are pushing back because smoking has been a big part of French cinema history. They argue that cigarettes are often used artistically, and the visual elements of smoking are key to French films.\n\nNow, breaking it down into three bullet points. The first point should introduce the debate and the key figures involved—so point 1 will be about the call from the senator and the health minister.\n\nThe second point needs to address the opposition from filmmakers, highlighting the cultural significance of smoking in French cinema. I should mention the visual aspects like the flare of a match and how directors have used smoking in famous films.\n\nFinally, the third point should tie in the broader implications, such as the influence of smoking scenes on perceptions and the challenge to cultural heritage. It's important to present both sides of the debate here.\n\nI need to ensure that each bullet point is concise and captures the essence without using the forbidden keywords. Also, keeping the language clear and straightforward is key so that the summary is easy to understand.\n",
    "filtered_answer":"\n\n* French Socialist senator Nadine Grelet-Certenais and health minister Agnès Buzyn advocate for banning smoking in movies to reduce its perceived coolness and tobacco industry advertising.  \n* Filmmakers argue against the ban, citing smoking as an integral part of French cinematic history and a visually striking element often exploited by directors.  \n* The debate highlights conflicting views on the role of smoking in culture versus public health, with some fearing a loss of artistic expression while others push for reduced harm.",

Ruddock’s appointment by cabinet, announced on Wednesday, is designed to head off a bruising debate about religious amendments in a same-sex marriage bill, but the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the review was “no substitute” for those amendments. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said it was important to look at the issue of religious freedom carefully, in light of the yes vote and impending legislation on marriage equality.

Ruddock has been asked to report by 31 March. Turnbull said a variety of proposals for legislative changes to protect freedom of religion have been put forward in recent months but many of them go beyond the immediate issue of marriage, and parliament needed to be wary of them. “Any reforms to protect religious freedom at large should be undertaken carefully,” he said in a statement on Wednesday. “There is a high risk of unintended consequences when parliament attempts to legislate protections for basic rights and freedoms, such as freedom of religion. The government is particularly concerned to prevent uncertainties caused by generally worded bill of rights-style declarations. “This will be a timely expert stocktake to inform consideration of any necessary legislative reforms.” Turnbull said Ruddock was the right person to conduct the review because he had served as Australia’s special envoy for human rights.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user provided a news article from The Guardian and included a partial summary. They want another summary based on the given sentences, structured into five paragraphs separated by markdown dividers.\n\nFirst, I need to outline the key points from the article. The main elements are Philip Ruddock's appointment, the context of the same-sex marriage bill, the debate within the government about religious freedom amendments, Turnbull's stance on the review, and the process involved.\n\nI should make sure each paragraph is concise, covering these points sequentially. I'll need to paraphrase without using the original text directly to ensure originality. Also, since the user specified five paragraphs, I have to make sure each part is distinct and flows logically.\n\nI'll start with the appointment and its purpose, then move on to the political debate, Turnbull's comments, the review's scope and Timelines, and finally, the Conservative Approach. Each section will be a separate paragraph, ensuring a clear and organized summary.\n\nI should also pay attention to the nuances, like who made which statements and the contrasting views within the government. This will provide a thorough overview while keeping each paragraph focused on one main idea.\n\nLet me organize the information to fit into five coherent paragraphs, ensuring each covers one aspect of the news article without overlapping too much. I'll make sure to include the important details about the review's purpose, the hazards of broad legislation, and Ruddock's qualifications.\n\nOverall, my goal is to create a clear, structured, and concise summary that captures all the essential elements of the article, tailored to meet the user's request for five paragraphs with markdown dividers.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, I need to tackle this query step by step. So, the user has provided a news excerpt from The Guardian about Thibaut Courtois and his contract situation at Chelsea. They've asked for a summary based on the given sentences. The response needs to be at least 19 sentences and structured into three paragraphs, each separated by two new lines. The first paragraph must start with the word \"Row\" and end with \"Is there anything else I can help with?\" without any additional text after that.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the provided excerpt carefully to understand the key points. Courtois doesn't expect contract talks to resume until the end of the season. Previous discussions in May didn't yield an agreement. He's beenintegral to Chelsea's success, winning two Premier League titles in three seasons. His agent has pushed for higher wages, near those of Eden Hazard and David de Gea. Courtois is happy at Chelsea but has expressed interest in La Liga, with Real Madrid among the interested clubs. His ex is back in Spain with their kids, indicating a possible personal link. Chelsea is aware of the interest and wants to resolve the contract before his deal's final year to maintain leverage over his value and negotiations. Courtois himself hasn't seen any new developments and focuses on performing well as a priority.\n\nNext, I need to structure this into three paragraphs. The first one starts with \"Row\" to set the context about the contract stalemate. I'll mention Courtois's expectations and the failed May talks, his role at Chelsea, the wage discussions, and the agencies tracking his situation, especially Real Madrid. I'll also note his personal ties and Chelsea's awareness of the interest.\n\nThe second paragraph should delve into Chelsea's perspective. Highlighting Courtois's integral role in their success, his agent's negotiating efforts, and the desire to finalize the contract before it lapses. It's important to emphasize Chelsea's anxiety to avoid losing leverage and how they might approach negotiations, possibly in the summer.\n\nLastly, the third paragraph should focus on Courtois's current state—his contentment with Chelsea, his professional focus, and the uncertainty around his contract. I'll tie in the aspects of performance and how this situation might impact both club and player interests as the season progresses, especially with his contract expiring in a year.\n\nI must ensure each paragraph is concise but covers all necessary points, with the first starting precisely with \"Row.\" Also, remember to end with the exact phrase as instructed. I need to avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and informative. Let me draft each section carefully, making sure to meet the sentence count and structure requirements. Finally, I'll review to ensure there are no extra words after the closing phrase.\n",

    "response":"\n\nThe Weekend Cookery Show is a humorous and satirical celebration of all things culinary, blending banter, exaggerated characters, and absurd kitchen mishaps.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a block of text from a news article, specifically the beginning of the \"Weekend Cookery Show\" program. They want me to summarize it, but there are specific keywords they want included: 'annual', 'cousin', 'creative', 'figure', 'suck'. Plus, the summary needs to be at least 17 sentences long, which is quite a lot.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the provided text carefully. It seems to be a satirical orsarcastic take on cooking shows, mentioning various shows like Saturday Kitchen and Saturday Morning With James Martin. The language is very descriptive and elaborate, referencing kitchen settings, chefs, and the flow of the show. Words like \"banter,\" \"molten moccasin,\" \"scallops in chino runoff\" suggest a comedic, almost absurd depiction of cooking segments.\n\nNow, I need to make sure to include the keywords. 'Annual' could fit by mentioning the shows being annual events. 'Cousin' might be a bit tricky; maybe in the context of family gatherings where these shows are watched. 'Creative' could relate to the chefs' creativity in the kitchen or perhaps the show's creative takes on cooking. 'Figure' might refer to the physical appearance of the characters as they are often exaggerated. 'Suck' is a bit more challenging, but perhaps in the sense of the show's humor being so intense it's almost hard to watch, or maybe literally, as in the characters might be 'sucking' something in a funny way.\n\nI need to structure a summary that flows well, ensuring all keywords are naturally integrated without forcing them. Since the summary needs to be at least 17 sentences, I should break down each part of the text into several points, maybe discussing the sets, the characters, the typical scenarios in the shows, and the overall humor.\n\nI'll start by introducing the shows and their comedic elements. Then, describe the settings, the chefs, and how they interact. Next, perhaps compare them to other similar shows, mention specific examples. Then bring in the annual nature of these events, maybe tying them into family traditions or watch parties. Introduce the cousin element by perhaps saying friends or family gather to watch, making it a social event. Describe the creative elements in the kitchen and the Fig tree, maybe tying toJerusalem artichokes. Then, talk about the creative director and his role. Bring in the \"suck\" by highlighting the intensity of the humor or how overwhelming the show can be.\n\nI need to ensure each sentence transitions smoothly into the next, keeping the overall tone similar to the original text. It's important to maintain the satirical and exaggerated tone throughout the summary, even as I incorporate the required keywords.\n\nI'll also have to ensure that all five keywords are included naturally. 'Annual' can be used to describe the recurring nature of the show's segments. 'Cousin' might be used when referring to gathering with friends or family. 'Creative' in the context of the kitchen creativity or the show's creative writing. 'Figure' when describing physical humor, like exaggerated body movements. 'Suck' could be used to denote the strength of the humor or how the characters 'suck' something in a funny way, perhaps in their attempts at cooking or their antics.\n\nFinally, I'll wrap up the summary by highlighting the overall impact of these shows on their audience, maybe mentioning how they bring people together and the memorable elements of each episode. I'll count the sentences to ensure there are at least 17 and review to make sure all keywords are included seamlessly.\n\nThat should cover the requirements. Now, I can put it all together, making sure each point flows into the next while keeping the tone consistent with the original text. I'll check for keyword inclusion and sentence count before finalizing the response.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, I need to respond to the user's query about summarizing a news article excerpt. The user provided a few initial sentences from The Guardian article about Unity Spencer.

They also asked for two different responses separated by six asterisks.\n\nFirst, I should read and understand the provided text to identify the key details. Unity Spencer was the daughter of artist Stanley Spencer, a talented painter in her own right. She had solo exhibitions and contributed to significantart shows. Her autobiography was published with an exhibition of her work. There's mention of her friends and family, especially her grandfather George Carline and the artist David Inshaw. The article also notes that the public was more interested in their lifestyle than her art, which she often defended.\n\nNow, I need to incorporate the required keywords. The article mentions her death at 87, so I'll include 'birth' and 'death' naturally. 'Event' can refer to both her exhibitions and the publication of her autobiography. 'Load' might relate to the number of her works shown or her contributions. 'Nurse' is tricky; it's not explicitly mentioned, so I might have to adjust that or find a way to include it without forcing it, perhaps noting her support system.\n\nFor the first summary, I'll focus on her life, legacy, and the exhibitions. I'll mention her birth in 1933, death in 2021, the events like her shows and autobiography, the load of her work, and perhaps a nod to her friends or family as a support system, maybe using 'nurse' metaphorically as someone who supported her.\n\nThe second summary can take a slightly different angle, maybe focusing more on her family's influence, theoad of her work being showcased, and the 'event' of her autobiography and exhibition together. Again, I'll include 'birth' and 'death' to meet the criteria, and use 'nurse' in a supportive context.\n\nI should ensure each summary is concise, includes all keywords, and flows naturally. They should be distinct enough but both accurate. I'll make sure not to use markdown and keep the language clear.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so the user wants me to summarize the beginning of a news article about Multiyork Furniture going into administration. The key here is to make sure the summary meets their specific requirements.\n\nFirst, they mentioned that the summary should be one paragraph starting with the word \"job.\" That tells me the opening sentence should address the job risk. The article states that over 500 jobs are at risk, so I'll start with that.\n\nNext, I need to include the main points: the company's struggle in a tough retail market, the reason for administration (unable to meet financial liabilities due to trading losses), the financial figures like the £1.9m net debt and the profit numbers. Also, it's important to note when Multiyork was rescued by Charles Wade in 1995 and the ongoing efforts to find a buyer.\n\nI should make sure the summary flows well and concisely covers all these aspects without getting too bogged down in numbers. Keep it clear and straightforward since the user likely wants a quick overview of the situation before diving into details elsewhere.\n\nI shouldn't miss the mention of the administrator, Allan Graham, and the fact that the business will continue while administrators seek a buyer. That's crucial for the reader to understand the potential outcome.\n\nFinally, ensure the summary starts correctly with \"Job losses\" and flows logically through the key points, ending with the administration process and the hope for a buyer. Keeping it within one paragraph as requested is important, so I'll make sure not to split it unnecessarily.\n",

    "response":"\n\nThe **background** of the story revolves around a new tax on super-strength cider, which traditional cider makers fear will unfairly penalize them. The UK government introduced a new duty band on still cider and perry, targeting \"white cider\" – a strong, cheap variant often linked to alcohol misuse. While the Treasury aims to tackle public health issues, the move has sparked a **battle** between small, artisanal cider producers and the government. These makers argue that the tax will disproportionately affect them, as larger companies with more resources can adapt to the new regulations.\n\nBother traditional cider makers, who argue they are being caught in the crossfire of a policy that may not achieve its intended goals. Some, like Gwatkin Cider and Worley’s Cider, insist that the tax will not impact larger producers but will create unnecessary hurdles for smaller, craft-focused businesses. They highlight the contrast between their use of whole, fresh apples and the industrial methods of larger competitors, suggesting that the **wall** between traditional and industrial practices is being eroded.\n\nDespite the criticism, the tax seems to **look** more like a challenge for white cider firms, which could simply reformulate their products to meet the new standards. For example, White cider companies might drop their alcohol content to 6.9% to avoid the higher tax bracket. However, smaller producers warn that this loophole will not solve their problems, as they rely on premium, handcrafted products that cannot easily be scaled down. The **purchase** of premium cider may face pricing pressures, further endangering the survival of these small businesses. Meanwhile, larger white cider firms, like Aston Manor Cider, are already preparing to adjust their prices, indicating that the new tax could eventually benefit both consumers and the market.",

They highlight the contrast between their use of whole, fresh apples and the industrial methods of larger competitors, suggesting that the **wall** between traditional and industrial practices is being eroded.\n\nDespite the criticism, the tax seems to **look** more like a challenge for white cider firms, which could simply reformulate their products to meet the new standards. For example, White cider companies might drop their alcohol content to 6.9% to avoid the higher tax bracket. However, smaller producers warn that this loophole will not solve their problems, as they rely on premium, handcrafted products that cannot easily be scaled down. The **purchase** of premium cider may face pricing pressures, further endangering the survival of these small businesses. Meanwhile, larger white cider firms, like Aston Manor Cider, are already preparing to adjust their prices, indicating that the new tax could eventually benefit both consumers and the market.",

The sentences are from the Guardian and are about the funniest standup, sketch, book, and film experiences the author has had.

It starts with standup by Paul Foot, then moves through a sketch series, a book, and a film. Each section is highlighted as the funniest something the author has encountered. \n\nTo create the summaries, I should capture the essence of each part without getting too detailed. The first summary needs to be concise and perhaps list each medium (standup, sketch, book, film) with the respective examples. The second summary could take a different approach, maybe grouping them differently or focusing on the overall themes.\n\nI need to make sure both summaries are distinct. The first might be more straightforward, listing each item, while the second could emphasize the profound impact of the book or the icon status of Withnail and I. \n\nI also need to pay attention to the keywords: funny, funniest, love them, thrilling, appealing. Using these words can help maintain the tone. I should also ensure the summaries are clear and each one stands on its own, even though they're based on the same content.\n\nI should avoid any markdown and keep each summary as a single, coherent paragraph.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I've got this query to handle. The user provided a passage from The Guardian about the 1956 Suez crisis and the 2017 budget. They want a summary that includes specific keywords: 'bird', 'commercial', 'method', 'possession', and 'proof'. First, I need to understand the main points of the passage.\n\nThe passage compares the Suez crisis as a moment of decline for Britain and the 2017 budget as an economic equivalent. It points out that despite measures like extra funding for the NHS or universal credit, the real issue was the alarming economic state as reported by the Office for Budget Responsibility. The UK had been progressing with better productivity and living standards, but things seem to be declining now.\n\nNow, I have to weave in the keywords. 'Bird' is a bit tricky because it's not directly related. Maybe it can symbolize decline, like an uneven economy, but not sure how it fits naturally. 'Commercial' could relate to the economy, perhaps describing the state of industries. 'Method' might link to the strategies or approaches used by the government. 'Possession' could refer to the nation's strength or decline. 'Proof' would tie into the data showing economic decline.\n\nI need to structure it so each keyword seamlessly fits. Starting with the Suez crisis as a historical decline, then the 2017 budget showing similar economic issues. Mention the Forget other measures part, focus on the economic 'proof' from OBR, then move into how the UK's ascent has been hampered. Use 'method' as the strategy's ineffectiveness. 'Possession' of economic strength becoming a thing of the past. Finally, link it to a 'bird' as an image of instability or decline.\n\nWait, maybe the bird is just a metaphor, not a literal. So perhaps thereturnal of instability is like a bird flapping wings, causing uncertainty. That makes sense poetically.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll make sure each section flows logically, uses all keywords without forcing them, and keeps the summary concise. Finally, add the P.P.S at the end as instructed.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so the user has provided a query where they're asking me to summarize a specific news article excerpt from The Guardian. The summary needs to include a title and four paragraphs separated by markdown dividers. They've also included an example response for me to follow.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the content of the provided text. It's about the financial challenges faced by people in care homes, particularly those who are self-funding their care. The user points out that media coverage often oversimplifies these financial obligations, highlighting how local authorities don't fully cover costs after a certain threshold. They also mention that families are popisng significant expenses, including the privatization of care homes leading to high charges without regulation. Additionally, there's a reference to an investment scheme in UK care homes promising high returns.\n\nNow, breaking this down, the summary should capture the main issues: media misrepresentation, how Local Authorities handle fees, the personal financial struggles of families, and the impact of privatization and investment schemes. The title needs to encapsulate the core theme, which is the financial burden on self-funding care home residents.\n\nLooking at the example response, it's structured with a title and four paragraphs, each addressing these points. I should ensure that my summary mirrors this structure. \n\nI'll start by crafting a clear title, maybe something like \"The Financial Burden on Self-Funding Care Home Residents: A Closer Look\". Then, the first paragraph can address the media's inaccurate portrayal and explain the Local Authority responsibilities. The second paragraph can delve into the personal story of the user's mother and the high costs involved. The third paragraph should cover the issue of privatization and its effects. Finally, the last paragraph can discuss the investment schemes and their implications.\n\nI need to make sure each paragraph is concise and flows logically. Also, ensuring that all key points from the original text are included without being too verbose. Since the user provided an example, I can model my summary similarly to ensure it meets their expectations.\n\nI should also keep in mind that the user might be looking for a precise summary that highlights the financial exploitation aspects, especially how self-funders are forced to sell assets and deal with clawbacks from the council. Additionally, the privatization and investment angles show systemic issues, which are important to convey.\n\nNow, putting it all together, I'll draft the title, then each paragraph addressing the media, personal story, privatization, and investment schemes. Making sure to link each paragraph smoothly and maintain a coherent flow throughout the summary.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to summarize a passage from a news article about James Toney. The summary needs to include specific keywords like 'chapter', 'disaster', 'floor', 'result', and 'trash', and it should be at least 202 words. Also, there's a requirement to have a title wrapped in double angular brackets. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the provided text. The passage starts with a confrontation between the narrator and James Toney. Toney is upset about being asked to stop fighting, which hints at his reputation as a formidable boxer. The next part delves into his troubled past, including his father's violent actions, which left his mother, Sherry, to take care of him. She brought him to a gym, teaching him proper boxing techniques to channel his aggression.\n\nI need to structure the summary so that it includes all the key points. The starting point is the emotional interaction with Toney, which sets the stage. Then, I should detail his violent background, especially his father's crime, to show how Sherry reacted. This forms a significant 'chapter' in Toney's life. \n\nThe keywords need to be seamlessly incorporated. 'Chapter' can describe Toney's turbulent upbringing. 'Disaster' fits the violent events with his father. 'Trash' can refer to his father's actions and its impact. 'Floor' might be used to describe his father's actions as hitting the 'floor' emotionally or physically. 'Result' and 'trash' can describe the outcome of his father's actions as trash and the resultant struggles.\n\nI also need to ensure that the summary flows naturally, connecting each event in sequence. The title should encapsulate the essence of the passage—perhaps something like \"A Hard Road to Redemption: The James Toney Story.\" This sets the tone for a narrative about overcoming adversity.\n\nI must make sure that each keyword is used contextually without forcing them, ensuring the summary reads smoothly. The focus should be on how Sherry's intervention changed Toney's trajectory, despite his violent past. Also, her role in his life could be highlighted as a turning point that led to his success as a boxer.\n\nI should also note that the passage doesn't go into details about Toney's later career, just his early days. This helps in keeping the summary focused on his formative years. The purpose might be to show how his past influenced his emotional state when the narrator approached him, adding depth to the story.\n\nAnother consideration is the length requirement. At least 202 words, so I need to ensure that each point is elaborated enough to meet the word count without being redundant. I'll break it down into paragraphs, each covering a specific aspect—meeting Toney, his upbringing, Sherry's role, and the impact on his life.\n\nLastly, I'll ensure the language is formal but engaging, as it's a summary from a news article. The inclusion of the keywords should feel natural within the narrative, enhancing the depth of the summary without overshadowing the main story elements.\n",

The film intertwines vulnerability and toughness, offering a nuanced portrayal of Frankie’s inner turmoil.\n\nP.P.S. The text highlights Dickinson’s acting prowess and Hittman’s ability to examine the complexities of Frankie’s character.",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user provided a query where they asked to summarize a news article about Kevin Spacey facing more sexual assault allegations. The user’s instruction was pretty clear: they wanted a summary of at least 12 sentences wrapped in double quotes. My initial thought is that the user is likely needing this for either academic purposes or perhaps for a report or presentation where a concise overview is necessary.\n\nLooking at the provided response, it seems like the user wants a detailed summary that captures all the key points mentioned in the news article. The summary is pretty comprehensive, covering not just the latest allegations but also mentioning the previous ones and the organizations involved like the Met and the Old Vic theatre. \n\nI should consider if the user wants just the facts or if they might be looking for more analysis. However, since the instruction was to summarize based on the sentences provided, it's likely they just need a factual recap without personal opinions. The response includes specific details like the years 2005 and 2008, the victims referred to as Victim 1 and 2, and mentions the locations in south London. \n\nAnother thing to note is that the user mentioned wrapping the entire response in double quotes, which suggests they might be using this for a specific formatting need, perhaps for a document or presentation where the summary needs to be easily identifiable. \n\nI also think about the user's potential deeper needs. They might be looking to quickly grasp the situation without reading the entire article, so it's important to include all critical information concisely. Including the impact on Spacey's career and the ongoing investigations gives a complete picture. \n\nI should make sure that the summary is accurate and doesn't miss any crucial details. The part about the Old Vic theatre contacting 56 people and having 20 allegations is significant because it shows the extent of the issue beyond just the police cases. \n\nIn summary, the key points to include are: the new allegations, the police involvement, the victims, the areas where the assaults allegedly happened, Spacey being the suspect, the investigation units handling the cases, previous allegations, the Old Vic theatre's involvement, and the impact on Spacey's reputation. Ensuring that the summary flows well and each sentence logically follows the previous one is important for readability.\n\nI might also think about the dates and the timeline of events, as this shows the persistence of the issue over several years. Including that Spacey has faced multiple accusations in both the US and the UK adds context about the broader nature of the allegations against him.\n\nOverall, the user’s response seems to meet the requirements by providing a clear, fact-based summary. I’d make sure to double-check the facts to ensure accuracy, especially since the information is likely sensitive and could be legally sensitive. The response should be neutral and stick strictly to the information provided in the article to avoid any misunderstandings or potential biases.\n",

It sounds positively ecstatic, which comes as a relief. Utopia’s predecessor, 2015’s Vulnicura, was a remarkable record, a latterday entry into the canon of legendary break-up albums.

It was raw, brave, challenging, unique and all the other adjectives heaped on it in reviews, but with the best will in the world, any album so harrowing that the appearance of gloom-laden vocalist Anohni constitutes a moment of light relief is going to be one that defies you to listen to it repeatedly. Utopia reanimates Vulnicura’s collaboration with Venezuela-born electronic auteur Arca, but is made of lighter material. Aside from his endlessly shifting soundscapes, distorted beats and penchant for sonic tapestries made from manipulated vocal samples, the album’s primary sound is woodwind, provided by an assembly of 12 female flautists from Reykjavik, which automatically lends it a far airier quality than the claustrophobic Vulnicura. It is, Björk says, her “Tinder album”, and its advance billing as a kind of Songs for Swinging Bachelorettes is borne out by its lyrics, which are obsessed both with technology and the vicissitudes of budding romance. “Is this excess texting blessing?” ponders Blissing Me, the saga of “two music nerds … sending each other MP3s”, before reverting to grief: “our physical union a fantasy, I just fell in love with a song”.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"\n\nInjury! Björk’s latest studio album, *Utopia*, begins with a strikingly vibrant and electronic sound that contrasts sharply with the somber, atonal experimentation of her 2015 record, *Vulnicura*. The opening track, *Arisen My Senses*, bursts with life, blending birdsong, harp chords, and beats that evoke a sense of ecstatic joy. This release is a much-needed antidote to the raw, challenging emotions of *Vulnicura*, which was celebrated for its bold and unique approach but left listeners grappling with its intense mournfulness.\n\nThe album revisits Björk’s collaboration with Venezuelan electronic artist Arca, whose shifting soundscapes and distorted beats define much of *Utopia*. However, this time, the music is lighter and more expansive. Aiming for a more airy quality, Björk assembled 12 female flautists from Reykjavik, infusing the album with a delicate and ethereal sound. While *Vulnicura* felt claustrophobic, *Utopia* soars with a freshness that invites repeated listens. Björk has described the album as her “Tinder album,” reflecting its focus on modern love, technology, and the complexities of human connection. Tracks like *Blissing Me* explore the highs and lows of romance, blending humor with heartache.\n\nThemes of technology and romance dominate the album’s lyrical content, with *Blissing Me* exemplifying the story of two music nerds exchanging MP3s, only to realize their physical connection is a fantasy. While the album doesn’t match the experimental rigor of *Vulnicura*, it offers a joyful and forward-thinking take on artistry, showcasing Björk’s ability to reinvent herself while maintaining her signature inventiveness and emotional depth. *Utopia* is a celebration of renewal, defined by its vibrant textures, collaborations, and existential musings.",
    "reasoning":"\nAlright, let me try to figure out what the user is asking for here. They provided a news article excerpt about Björk's new album \"Utopia\" and want a summary. The specific instructions mention three paragraphs, each separated by two newlines, and the first paragraph must start with the word \"injury.\"\n\nHmm, so the user is probably looking for an analysis or a concise overview of the article. The first paragraph should kick off with \"injury,\" which is a bit unusual, but I guess it's to emphasize something unexpected happening. The second paragraph likely discusses the change in Björk's music style from her previous album, and the third might delve into the musical collaborators and the overall feel of \"Utopia.\"\n\nI need to make sure each paragraph covers a distinct part of the article. The first paragraph introduces the unexpected aspect of the new album, the second talks about the shift in tone and collaboration, and the third explains the musical elements and themes.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned that the summary should only include paragraphs separated by two newlines, which I need to follow precisely. I'll start the first paragraph with \"Injury,\" then move on to the transformation in Björk's sound, and finally wrap it up with the musical and lyrical aspects of the new album.\n\nI should ensure the summary is clear and concise, capturing the key points without being too detailed. It's important to highlight the contrast between her previous album's somber tone and the new one's more upbeat and technical elements. Mentioning the collaboration with Arca again and the use of woodwinds will add depth to the summary.\n\nI think I've got a good structure in mind. Start with the unexpected positive shift, discuss the evolution in sound and themes, then detail the musical elements and lyrical content. That should cover all the bases the user is asking for.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query. They provided a news excerpt about Jeff Stelling and his rant against expected goals. The user is asking me to summarize it and decide whether to answer with 'My answer is yes.', 'My answer is no.', or 'My answer is maybe.'\n\nFirst, I should read the provided text carefully. Jeff Stelling, known for being cheerful, gets frustrated when his team, Hartlepool, loses, but he usually takes it in stride. This time, he's in a video ranting about expected goals after Arsène Wenger mentioned them during a preview for the north London derby. He dismisses expected goals as a useless statistic and questions why they're shown after the game is over.\n\nNow, I need to determine what the user's question is. They provided three options, so I think they are looking for my opinion or stance based on the article. The options are yes, no, or maybe.\n\nJeff Stelling is complaining about expected goals. So, the question is probably about whether this incident indicates something about Expected Goals (EG) in football. Do they really tell you how the game will go?\n\nI know that Expected Goals is a statistic used in football analytics. It's calculated based on historical data and gives an estimate of how many goals a team is expected to score. But Jeff seems to think it's useless because after the game, you already know the result. However, in football analysis, expected goals can provide insights into team performance and predictability.\n\nBut does this incident mean that expected goals are useless? I don't think so. They can still be useful for understanding the likelihood of goals and evaluating tactics. So, while Jeff's rant is funny and dismissive, it doesn't necessarily mean that expected goals are useless.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if this strengthens the idea that expected goals are a useless statistic. From the article, Jeff is critical of it. He mentions it's the most useless stat. So, does that mean I should answer that it's no, because expected goals aren't useless they have value despite his criticism.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a maybe, because while he's dismissive, others might still find value in expected goals.\n\nWait, the options are yes, no, or maybe. The question is whether this incident indicates that expected goals are useless. So, Jeff's rant suggests he thinks they're useless, but that's his opinion. So, does this mean that the option is 'My answer is yes.' because it shows they're useless? Or is it 'maybe,' because it's just one person's opinion.\n\nI think since Jeff is a well-known personality, his opinion could carry some weight, but it's not a definitive statement. Others might disagree. So, perhaps the correct answer is 'maybe,' as it's uncertain whether this indicates expected goals are useless or just one perspective.\n\nWait, but the user might be looking for whether expected goals are useless or not. Since Jeff is a supporter and perhaps not an expert in analytics, his dismissing expected goals might not represent the broader view. So, it's not a definitive yes, it's more of a maybe.\n\nI think I should answer that it's 'maybe,' because Jeff's rant shows dismissal but doesn't prove the point definitively.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Conservative MPs have countered Jeremy Corbyn’s swingeing criticism of the budget as the work of “a government no longer fit for office” with a broad endorsement of Philip Hammond, in sharp contrast to their open reservations about the chancellor’s plans last year. Hammond’s colleagues used the first of four days of scheduled debate about the budget to praise not just his high-profile announcements on housing, but also his commitment of £3bn to prepare for any Brexit eventuality. In his response to the budget, Corbyn – it is the leader of the opposition who traditionally speaks rather than the shadow chancellor – said Hammond had completely failed to tackle a national crisis of stagnation and falling wages. “The test of a budget is how it affects the reality of people’s lives all around this country,” the Labour leader said. “And I believe as the days go ahead, and this budget unravels, the reality will be – a lot of people will be no better off. And the misery that many are in will be continuing.” Largely eschewing direct focus on Hammond’s specific announcements in favour of a broader critique of the government’s wider economic approach, Corbyn castigated Hammond for again missing deficit reduction targets, and for a continued spending squeeze on schools and the police. Speaking about housing, Corbyn said rough sleeping had doubled since 2010, and that this Christmas 120,000 children would be living in temporary accommodation. “We need a large-scale publicly funded housebuilding programme, not this government’s accounting tricks and empty promises.”Summing up, he said: “We were promised a revolutionary budget. The reality is nothing has changed. People were looking for help from this budget.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Conservative MPs have countered Jeremy Corbyn’s swingeing criticism of the budget as the work of “a government no longer fit for office” with a broad endorsement of Philip Hammond, in sharp contrast to their open reservations about the chancellor’s plans last year. Hammond’s colleagues used the first of four days of scheduled debate about the budget to praise not just his high-profile announcements on housing, but also his commitment of £3bn to prepare for any Brexit eventuality. In his response to the budget, Corbyn – it is the leader of the opposition who traditionally speaks rather than the shadow chancellor – said Hammond had completely failed to tackle a national crisis of stagnation and falling wages. “The test of a budget is how it affects the reality of people’s lives all around this country,” the Labour leader said. “And I believe as the days go ahead, and this budget unravels, the reality will be – a lot of people will be no better off. And the misery that many are in will be continuing.” Largely eschewing direct focus on Hammond’s specific announcements in favour of a broader critique of the government’s wider economic approach, Corbyn castigated Hammond for again missing deficit reduction targets, and for a continued spending squeeze on schools and the police. Speaking about housing, Corbyn said rough sleeping had doubled since 2010, and that this Christmas 120,000 children would be living in temporary accommodation. “We need a large-scale publicly funded housebuilding programme, not this government’s accounting tricks and empty promises.”Summing up, he said: “We were promised a revolutionary budget. The reality is nothing has changed. People were looking for help from this budget.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I've got this query to handle. The user pasted a news snippet from The Guardian about UK politics regarding the budget debate. They want me to summarize it with specific keywords: 'chart', 'departure', 'push', 'republic', and 'rest'. Plus, the summary needs to be in quotes, three sentences, and start with 'ticket'. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The article discusses how conservative MPs are criticizing Jeremy Corbyn's comments on the budget. Corbyn labeled the government as unfit, while MPs are defending Philip Hammond. Last year, there were reservations, but this time, they're supportive, especially of the £3bn Brexit preparation and housing policies. Corbyn is arguing that the budget isn't delivering for the people, pointing out issues like rough sleeping and poor living conditions.\n\nNow, the keywords. I need to incorporate 'chart' somehow—maybe as a graphical representation of their support shift. 'Departure' can relate to the swing from last year's reservations. 'Push' could describe the pressure on Hammond to perform. 'Republic' might fit into global economic contexts, but I'm not sure. 'Rest' could be used metaphorically, like the government's failure to address issues despite their efforts.\n\nI should structure the summary to include these words naturally. Starting with 'ticket' to set the context, then mention the departure from last year's doubts, the push for Hammond's support, and tie in the 'rest' of the government's impact. Also, I'll add the 'chart' metaphorically to show the shift visually.\n\nMaking sure the summary flows well and each sentence adds a piece of the story, I think that's how I can incorporate all the required keywords effectively.\n",

The summit between the three powers, all deeply involved in the conflict, is designed to pave the way for a settlement likely to leave Syria’s Russian- and Iranian-backed president, Bashar al-Assad, in power within a reformed Syrian constitution. It follows the near-collapse of the Syrian opposition since Moscow’s armed intervention in 2015 and the military defeat of Islamic State in all of the major towns and cities that were under its control. “The militants in Syria have sustained a decisive blow and now there is a realistic chance to end the multi-year civil war,” Putin declared as he hosted Iran’s Hassan Rouhani and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Sochi. “The Syrian people will have to determine their own future and agree on the principles of their own statehood. It is obvious that the process of reform will not be easy and will require compromises and concessions from all participants, including of course the government of Syria.” Putin hosted Assad in Sochi on Monday and extracted a more emollient tone than normal. He insisted on Wednesday that Assad was committed to a peace process, constitutional reform and free elections. The Russian leader also held a frantic round of telephone diplomacy with other world leaders including Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump. Putin urged Iran and Turkey to start a discussion with him on the reconstruction of Syria. “Given the colossal scale of the destruction it would be possible to think together about the development of a comprehensive program for Syria,” he said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"\n\nMaintaining peace in Syria requires compromise, Vladimir Putin has stated, as Iran and Turkey arrived in Sochi for talks. The summit aims to facilitate a settlement that retains Bashar al-Assad within a reformed Syrian constitution. This effort follows Syria's military defeat of Islamic State and the collapse of the opposition, bolstered by Russia's intervention since 2015. Putin emphasized the need for reforms, stating the war's end hinges on Syrian people's choices and compromises from all sides.  \n\nThe summit coincides with Russia's diplomatic highs, with Iran and Turkey deepening ties through shared interests in stabilizing Syria. Russia's involvement, including military aid to Assad, has reshaped the conflict. Putin hosted Assad, asserting his commitment to peace, constitutional reform, and free elections. The Russian leader also engaged in frantic telephone diplomacy with global leaders, including Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the U.S., to advance reconstruction efforts.  \n\nPutin urged Iran and Turkey to collaborate on Syria's post-war rebuilding, urging a comprehensive program due to the destruction. He highlighted Syria's potential for recovery, signaling Russia's readiness to assist. The Sochi summit reflects Russia's central role in mediating a conflict that has lasted over six years. With the Syrian opposition weakened and ISIS defeated, the stage is set for a new political order under Assad's leadership.  \n\nPutin's efforts aim to secure a stable Syria aligned with Russian and Iranian interests. The meeting underscores Russia's strategic maneuvering in the region, balancing relations with Turkey and Iran while maintaining influence over Assad. The focus on constitutional reform and elections suggests a path for Syria to emerge from war, though challenges remain.  \n\nIn summary, the Sochi summit marks a pivotal moment in Syria's peace process, driven by Russia's diplomatic initiative. With Assad's continued role and international backing, the roadmap for Syria's future is evolving under Russia's guidance. The involvement of key powers like Iran and Turkey, alongside Putin's telephone diplomacy, highlights the multifaceted nature of Russia's engagement in the region.",

The first paragraph will start with \"Maintaining\" and introduce the peace settlement. The second can discuss the summit's purpose and context, including the defeat of ISIS. The third can cover the telephone diplomacy and the focus on reconstruction. The fourth might delve into relations with other countries and efforts made. The fifth should wrap up with Putin's diplomatic success.\n\nI need to ensure each paragraph flows naturally, is concise, and adheres to word and sentence limits. I should avoid any markdown, so just plain text with line breaks.

    "response":"\n\nSon, the sitcom *Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?* stands as a timeless blend of comedy and melancholy, a rare achievement in British television. The show navigated sharp wit, slapstick humor, and farce while infusing every episode with wistfulness, nostalgia, and regret. Characters like Bob and Terry oftenlazily began reminiscing, and Terry’s struggle to rejoin civilian life after army service added depth to the narrative. The poignant expressions on Rodney Bewes’s face further emphasized the show’s emotional undercurrents.  \n\nThe show’s success was largely due to its meticulous craftsmanship, with writers like Ian La Frenais and Mike Hugg creating a theme song that lingered in viewers’ minds. Despite attempts to promote it with a fictional band called Highly Likely, the theme failed to become a hit, barely scraping into the Top 40. This lack of mainstream success is a brave choice, reflecting the show’s unique tone and the creative team’s frustrations with earlier failed ventures, such as Joe Fagin’s ill-fated 1984 song.  \n\nThe narrative’s flow often explores themes of loss and regret, particularly through Terry’s journey of self-discovery. The show’s ability to balance humor with introspection set it apart from other series like *Dad’s Army* and *Porridge*, which were perpetually repeats. Its brief run on terrestrial TV, last aired 20 years ago, ensures it remains a hidden gem in British TV history.  \n\nDespite its lack of widespread popularity, *Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?* hasleft an indelible mark on television comedy. The brave appointment of a whimsical theme and the show’s ability to resonate with viewers on an emotional level earned it a devoted following. Its legacy lies in its ability to transcend time, offering a poignant reflection on life’s complexities and the enduring power of well-crafted storytelling.",

This lack of mainstream success is a brave choice, reflecting the show’s unique tone and the creative team’s frustrations with earlier failed ventures, such as Joe Fagin’s ill-fated 1984 song.  \n\nThe narrative’s flow often explores themes of loss and regret, particularly through Terry’s journey of self-discovery. The show’s ability to balance humor with introspection set it apart from other series like *Dad’s Army* and *Porridge*, which were perpetually repeats. Its brief run on terrestrial TV, last aired 20 years ago, ensures it remains a hidden gem in British TV history.  \n\nDespite its lack of widespread popularity, *Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?* hasleft an indelible mark on television comedy. The brave appointment of a whimsical theme and the show’s ability to resonate with viewers on an emotional level earned it a devoted following. Its legacy lies in its ability to transcend time, offering a poignant reflection on life’s complexities and the enduring power of well-crafted storytelling.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n England are pencilled in to play Ireland in Dublin next autumn under the auspices of a new Six Nations tournament to increase the strength of northern hemisphere rugby league. The tournament is provisionally on the Rugby League International Federation’s calendar and would comprise the same participants as rugby union’s Six Nations in 2018. Of those six, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France and Italy were eliminated in the group stages of the current Rugby League World Cup, while England face Tonga in a semi-final on Saturday. Richard Egan, the chairman of Rugby League Ireland, told the Guardian: “The provisional RLIF fixtures at the minute show that there is a Six Nations next year. It’s unconfirmed at the minute, though, and that’s where I have issues in developing the sport here. “In other sports you can buy tickets years in advance but I can’t guarantee what fixtures I’ve got to sell next year.” It is unclear when the RLIF plan to announce the details officially, though the tournament should take place in October and November, following the conclusion of the domestic season. However, that clashes with England’s three-Test series against New Zealand next autumn, details of which the Rugby Football League confirmed on Tuesday. That lends weight to the suggestion that the England Knights concept – an emerging talent side similar to union’s England Saxons – may return to play in the tournament. Egan, however, would be keen to see the strongest England side possible travel to Ireland to play in Dublin.

Additionally, they want exactly three bullet points, each containing specific keywords: 'leader', 'produce', 'revolution', 'state', and 'young'. There's also a requirement to end with a specific phrase and a postscript note.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the article to identify the main points. It's about a new Six Nations rugby tournament involving countries like England, Ireland, Scotland, etc. The tournament is organized under the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF). The key figures involved include Richard Egan, the leader of Rugby League Ireland, who is concerned about the announce details.\n\nI need to structure each paragraph to cover different aspects: introduction of the tournament, the upcoming fixtures and conflicts, and Egan's concerns and the proposed solutions. Each bullet point should encapsulate one of the required keywords. I have to ensure each bullet includes a keyword without forcing it, maintaining a natural flow.\n\nIn the first paragraph, I'll introduce the tournament and mention Egan's role as the leader. The second can talk about the fixtures conflicting with England's matches against New Zealand, possibly leading to the use of the Knights. The third can address Egan's preference for the strongest team and plans to see a young squad play.\n\nI must make sure each bullet is concise and uses the keywords appropriately. Also, each paragraph should be separated by ***, as per the markdown divider. I need to be careful not to include any extra words after the specified ending phrase and add the P.P.S at the end.\n\nLet me check if I have all five keywords used: 'leader' in the first bullet, 'produce' in the second, 'revolution' in the third, 'state' mentioned about the tournament's state, and 'young' in the third bullet. Yes, all are included.\n\nAlright, time to put it all together, ensuring each paragraph is separated correctly and the bullets are as per the user's instructions.

A skittery waltz by Ethiopian jazz pioneer Hailu Mergia becomes a slinky piece of horn-led funk, complete with woozy slide guitar; a pulsating piece of Afrobeat by Benin’s Orchestre Poly-Rythmo features an ecstatic free-jazz freakout by tenorist Per “Texas” Johansson; a hymnal reading of Panda Bear’s You Can Count On Me comes wreathed in shards of astral jazz. Like all of Kajfeš’s covers albums, researching the source material will send you down some very rewarding wormholes.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Their latest release, the third installment in the *Reason Why* trilogy, features a captivating mix of covers. These tracks range from obscure worldbeat gems and recent indie anthems to dusty psychedelic oddities, each reimagined with creativity and flair by the nine-piece ensemble. The album showcases how the band transforms diverse source material, often with surprising results. A standout track is Hailu Mergia’s Ethiopian jazz piece, reworked into a slinky funk number with a resonate slide guitar solo. Similarly, Orchestre Poly-Rythmo’s Afrobeat masterpiece is elevated into an electrifying free-jazz performance by tenorist Per “Texas” Johansson. The band’s approach to covers is both adventurous and rewarding, sending listeners on a journey through rich, varied musical landscapes.\n\nPossibly one of the most compelling aspects of Kajfeš’s work is his ability to breathe new life into decades-old obscure tracks, often uncovering hidden gems that resonate deeply with modern ears. The band’s seamless fusion of genres and their innovative take on both classic and contemporary music make them a standout in the ever-growing world of vinyl reimaginations. This album, like its predecessors, is a testament to the power of music reclamation and reinvention, offering a fresh perspective on familiar sounds and introducing audiences to forgotten treasures along the way.\n\nP.P.S.",

The second paragraph must start with \"Possibly,\" and each paragraph should be separated by two newlines, like '\\n\\n' in Python. Also, I need to add a P.P.S. at the end.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the main points of the article. It's about the Subtropic Arkestra, led by Goran Kajfeš. They blend Afrobeat, Ethio-jazz, and big band funk. It's the third album in their Reason Why trilogy. They cover obscure gems, recent indie songs, and psychedelic tracks, each done creatively.\n\nIn the first paragraph, I should introduce the band, mention Kajfeš's leadership, the mix of genres, the cover songs, and the unique transformations they apply. I should make it concise but cover all key aspects: the blend of genres, the cover items, and the interesting way they're recreated.\n\nThe second paragraph needs to start with \"Possibly.\" I should discuss why these cover albums are recommended, maybe touch on the rewarding research angle mentioned. Also, I can speculate a bit into deeper layers of music appreciation.\n\nI also need to ensure the summary is clear, well-structured, and flows naturally. The paragraphs should be separated properly, and the P.P.S. should naturally follow the summary, perhaps adding a bonus tip or agree with the verdict.\n\nI should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text, as per the user's instructions. Also, the conclusion should reflect that the albums are highly recommended based on the creativity and detail put into the covers.\n\nLet me structure the first paragraph focusing on the band, their genres, the cover songs, and transformation. The second paragraph starts with \"Possibly,\" talking about the rewarding aspect of the covers, then delves into deeper music appreciation layers. Finally, end with the P.P.S. to add a friendly note.\n\nI think that covers everything. Now, I should make sure the language is formal but clear, fitting for a summary from a news snippet. Let me draft it accordingly.\n",

'Chest' can refer to Kweskin's body of work or how his music resonates deeply, like a full chest of wisdom. 'Following' could relate to the band members or the musical style being followed. \n\nFor the next response, I'll think of household items. Maybe his music is something you can enjoy at home like in a library, which is a quiet place. ' Oven ' could be a metaphorical reference to something sizzling or hot, perhaps his performances. \n\nI have to ensure each summary is distinct.

They specified that the summary must have exactly five bullet points using markdown, and they don't want certain keywords: 'creative', 'effort', 'importance', 'issue', or 'reaction'. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the provided text to understand the key points. It starts by mentioning the economic context—downgrading growth to 1.5% through 2022, which is bleak. So the first bullet should probably address the economic situation.\n\nNext, the text talks about Philip Hammond needing laughter to lighten the mood because the economic news was grim. That makes sense for the second bullet.\n\nThen, there's a series of awkward events leading up to the speech. The Treasury's Beatles tribute didn't go well, he was late due to traffic, and he avoided a self-driving car photo op but still mentioned the technology in his speech. That's a few points. So maybe two bullets for the incidents and one about mentioning self-driving cars.\n\nFinally, he pokes fun at Jeremy Clarkson and others, which went well with the audience. That's the fifth bullet.\n\nI need to make sure each bullet covers these aspects without using the excluded keywords and that the summary flows logically. Let me structure each bullet to hit these points clearly.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n New nuclear power stations in the UK can no longer compete with windfarms on price, according to the boss of a German energy company’s green power arm. Hans Bunting, the chief operating officer of renewables at Innogy SE, part of the company that owns the UK energy supplier npower, said offshore windfarms had become mainstream and were destined to become even cheaper because of new, bigger turbines. Asked whether nuclear groups that want to build new reactors in the UK could compete with windfarms on cost, even when their intermittency was taken into account, Bunting replied: “Obviously they can’t.” His comments came after MPs criticised the £30bn cost to consumers for EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and said ministers should revisit the case for new nuclear before proceeding with more projects. Innogy recently secured a subsidy of £74.75 per megawatt hour of power to build a windfarm off the Lincolnshire coast, which is £17.75 cheaper than Hinkley and should be completed about three years earlier. “What we see now [with prices] is with today’s technology. It’s not about tomorrow’s technology, which is about [to come in] 2025, 2027, when Hinkley will most likely come to the grid ... and then it [windfarms] will be even cheaper.” While the company is planning to use the most powerful turbines in the world today for the Lincolnshire windfarm, Bunting said even bigger ones in development would drive costs down further. “A few years ago everyone thought 10MW [turbines] was the maximum, now we’re talking about 15[MW]. It seems the sky is the limit,” he said. “[It] means less turbines for the same capacity, less steel in the ground, less cables, even bigger rotors catching more wind, so it will become cheaper.” However, EDF argued that nuclear was also on a path to lower costs. “Early offshore wind projects started at around £150 per MW\/h and developers have shown they can offer lower prices by repeating projects with an established supply chain – the same is true for nuclear,” an EDF spokesman said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user is asking me to summarize a news article from the Guardian. The content is about nuclear power in the UK and how it compares to windfarms in terms of cost and technology. They provided the beginning sentences of the article, so I need to make sure I include all the key points from those sentences.\n\nFirst, I should identify the main elements of the article. It mentions Hans Bunting, the COO of Innirty SE's renewables division, talking about offshore windfarms becoming mainstream and getting cheaper. He compares this to nuclear power and says nuclear can't compete on cost, especially because wind is more affordable and quicker to build. There's also a subsidy mentioned for a windfarm project off the Lincolnshire coast, which is cheaper than Hinkley Point and completed faster. Bunting talks about turbine technology advancements, like bigger turbines leading to lower costs.\n\nThen I see EDF, a nuclear company, responding by arguing that nuclear is also getting cheaper due to replication in supply chains. So, I need to balance these viewpoints in the summary.\n\nI should structure the JSON with a summary and a key points array. The summary should encapsulate both the cost comparison and the technological advancements in wind energy. The key points should list each main idea clearly: competition on price, subsidies, turbine technology, cost of nuclear, and EDF's defense.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid using certain keywords like 'bag', 'hit', 'piece', 'spirit', 'west'. So I'll make sure none of those are in the summary or key points.\n\nFinally, I'll wrap everything in a JSON format as the user specified. I'll make sure the summary is concise and the key points are bulleted for clarity. This should meet the user's requirements effectively.\n",
