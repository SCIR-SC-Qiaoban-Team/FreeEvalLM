    "response":"\n\n<<The Cursed Sheraton: A Pacific Dream Turned Nightmare>>  \n\nThe Sheraton hotel complex on Rarotonga, a South Pacific island, lies abandoned and overgrown, a haunting reminder of a failed luxury resort project.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so there's this query from the user. They're asking for a summary of a news article from The Guardian. The article is about an abandoned Sheraton hotel on Rarotonga. Hmm, I need to understand the content first. The hotel has been derelict for 25 years, which is a long time. It's overgrown with jungle, cows, chickens, goats... that paints a vivid picture. The place is known as a \"cursed\" hotel.\n\nThe user wants a summary with a title, four paragraphs, each separated by a divider, and ending with \"Any other questions?\" Got it. They also specified that the title should be in double angular brackets. So, I need to come up with a catchy title first. Maybe something like \"The Cursed Sheraton: APacific Dream Turned Nightmare.\" Sounds good.\n\nNow, the summary needs to cover the history of the hotel project. It was an Italian-backed venture from the late 1980s aimed at bringing luxury tourism to the Cook Islands. But it failed due to financial issues, mafia involvement, and money laundering. The government ended up with a huge debt. That's important to include.\n\nNext, there are efforts to revive the hotel now. Tim Tepaki has Chinese backing and wants to turn it into a destination for Chinese tourists. Currently, the Cook Islands rely on Australian and New Zealand visitors, so this new plan could diversify their tourism market. That's a significant point about economic impact.\n\nI also need to highlight the potential transformation and challenges. The article hints at the project's possible bigger impact than before. So, in the summary, I should mention both the hope for economic revival and the uncertainties involved.\n\nI should make sure each paragraph is concise and covers one main idea. The first paragraph introduces the hotel and its current state. The second delves into its failed past. The third talks about the new plans. The fourth discusses the potential impact and challenges.\n\nFinally, wrapping up with \"Any other questions?\" as instructed. I have to avoid any markdown and keep the response in plain text, but the user initially allowed markdown in the example. Wait, no, in the response they want it without markdown, but the example used dividers. Maybe just separate paragraphs without any special formatting beyond line breaks.\n\nOverall, ensuring clarity and that all key points from the article are covered. Need to make sure the summary is informative and meets the structure the user outlined.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Pauline Hanson has likened the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, to a “spoilt brat” for ruling out a deal with One Nation. Arriving in Bundaberg just as the Labor campaign left, Hanson, who remains the most visible One Nation asset in Queensland, despite not running in Saturday’s state election, lashed out at Palaszczuk’s continued criticism of the party. Palaszczuk’s insistence that Labor would rather go into opposition than form government with One Nation has become its strongest attack line against the Liberal National party, which is directly preferencing One Nation in 50 of the 61 seats it is running in, as well as admitting, indirectly, it would form government with One Nation, if necessary. The opposition leader, Tim Nicholls, who has previously said he would work with the parliament Queenslanders delivered, was unable to answer “yes or no” to the question of whether he would form government with One Nation on Tuesday during a radio quiz, instead opting for “pass”. Hanson has responded with the line that the major parties are choosing not to respect the will of the people, in the same way Donald Trump’s campaign used Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment against the Democrat campaign last year. “I don’t think the premier knows what she is doing actually, I think she is in such a turmoil over this and she is actually needs to get out of the sandpit and be the leader for this state,” Hanson said. “Because the way she is carrying on, it is not leadership, it is not quality. “To say you won’t work with One Nation, it is just ridiculous. It’s like a spoilt brat, she is carrying on like a spoilt kid, and if that is what leadership means then I think she is heading down the wrong path and Tim Nicholls, he needs to grow up and make a decision, because people want clear decision in this state.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, I need to respond to this query where the user provided a news excerpt and wants a specific summary format.

They want a summary with exactly four bullet points, each marked with a section.\n\nFirst, I should identify the key points in the article. Pauline Hanson compares Palaszczuk to a \"spoilt brat\" for refusing a deal with One Nation. Hanson is prominent in Queensland but isn't running in the election. The Premier's stance is a strong attack on the Liberal National Party, which is preferencing One Nation. Palaszczuk would rather Labor go into opposition than work with One Nation. \n\nNext, I'll note the opposition leader, Tim Nicholls, being unclear about forming a government with One Nation. Then, Hanson accuses major parties of ignoring the people's will, similar to Trump's campaign strategy. Finally, she criticizes both leaders, urging them to lead effectively.\n\nI'll structure each section to capture these elements concisely, ensuring clarity and exactly four bullet points.

In a company memo obtained by the Hollywood Reporter, Lasseter acknowledged failing to create a culture of \"support and collaboration\" and hinted at behavior that led to difficult conversations. He expressed remorse for making some employees feel \"disrespected or uncomfortable,\" emphasizing that his intent was never to cause harm. Lasseter also apologized for \"unwanted hugs or any other gesture\" that may have crossed boundaries, stressing the importance of respecting personal boundaries.  \n\nCurve after curve, the news has brought into sharp focus the challenges of leadership and the evolving expectations of workplace culture. Lasseter, a co-founder of Pixar and director of Toy Story, has been a pivotal figure in the animation industry, but his actions have now drawn scrutiny. His decision to step away comes amid a broader conversation about power dynamics and accountability in Hollywood and beyond. The memo underscores a growing recognition of the need for leaders to reflect on their behavior and its impact on others.  \n\nDisney has responded with a statement reaffirming its commitment to fostering a respectful and empowering work environment. The company expressed appreciation for Lasseter’s candid apology and announced full support for his sabbatical. This response aligns with the growing industry trend of addressing misconduct allegations transparently and taking proactive steps to ensure workplace safety and inclusivity.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, I've got a user query here that needs a summary of a news article about John Lasseter taking a leave of absence. Let me start by reading the provided sentences carefully.\n\nThe user wants a summary in four paragraphs, each separated by two newlines. Oh, and the second paragraph must start with the word \"curve.\" Also, I need to include a title wrapped in double angular brackets. Got it.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the key points from the article. Lasseter is stepping down, mentions \"missteps,\" difficult conversations, and has apologized for making some employees feel disrespected or uncomfortable. He specifically talks about unwanted hugs and respecting boundaries. Disney supports his leave, and there's an investigation ongoing by the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into four paragraphs. The first paragraph should introduce Lasseter's leave and his memo. The second has to start with \"curve,\" so I can talk about the challenges in leadership or the shift in workplace culture. The third can cover Disney's response and commitment. The fourth will address the timing with the investigation, highlighting the changing industry dynamics.\n\nI should make sure each paragraph is concise and flows well. The title needs to capture the essence, maybe something about self-reflection and accountability. Let me draft that title first.\n\nWait, the second paragraph starting with \"curve\" might be a bit tricky. Maybe \"As the news of Lasseter’s leave sent shockwaves through the industry, it also brought into sharp focus the curve of accountability and leadership that many high-profile figures now face.\" That sounds good, it uses curve and touches on the broader implications.\n\nI also need to ensure that each paragraph clearly transitions to the next. Let me check the word count for each to keep them balanced. Probably each around 2-3 sentences.\n\nFinally, I'll review to make sure all the key points are covered: Lasseter's leave, his apology, Disney's response, and the ongoing investigation. That should meet the user's requirements.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Australia’s race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, says the high no vote in western Sydney in last week’s historic same-sex marriage postal survey reflects religious observance rather than ethnicity, and he has warned against an outbreak of crass, cultural stereotyping. Soutphommasane used a speech at the University of Western Sydney to issue a pointed warning against adopting “easy narratives” devoid of evidence about the behaviour or inclinations of particular ethnic groups in Australia. “In a world that many describe as post-truth or post-factual, our social cohesion is not always well served by jumping to conclusions,” he said. “Once-appealing narratives take hold, they can help fuel stereotypes about others – and these can be difficult to shake off. Sometimes this is because they may conveniently help to confirm cultural hierarchies in our society.” Soutphommasane said a narrative has sprung up since the postal survey which centres on ethnic minorities or multicultural communities being intrinsically hostile towards same-sex marriage, and to the LGBTI community at large. He said while some ethnic communities hold to the view that marriage is between a man and a woman, that view is shaped often by religious or cultural traditions. The race commissioner said a more clear-eyed examination of the postal survey data suggests religiosity, or religious observance, was a more significant factor for no voters – a fact well understood by the no campaign, which targeted messages to a range of communities in Sydney’s west. Soutphommasane said if you look at the voting trends outside western Sydney, a more mixed picture emerges – a picture where seats with populations of more than 40% born overseas overwhelmingly voted yes. He pointed out that the most multicultural electorates in New South Wales and Victoria recorded high yes votes – seats like Sydney, Grayndler, Kingsford Smith, Bradfield, Batman, Wills, Gellibrand and Chisholm. “To suggest that an overwhelming majority of multicultural communities voted no – and did so out of some essential cultural hostility against gays and lesbians – is to entertain something that comes close to an unkind stereotype,” the race commissioner said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

For example, mentioning Mugabe as a prominent figure, nobody in Beijing showing sorrow, relieving the situation under their policy's roof, brushing aside his problematic policies, and perhaps a stretch mentioning his daughter's absence from the scene.\n\nI need to ensure each keyword fits contextually without forcing them.

'Agent' could refer to the military leaders who played a key role. 'Equipment' isn't directly mentioned, but maybe the military's tools or machinery count. 'Excuse' might relate to Mugabe's reasons for staying in power. 'Fruit' is tricky; perhaps the outcome of his rule or the hoped-for change. 'Secretary' could be a reference to a government official, like a secretary in the administration.\n\nI need to craft a concise summary that touches on these points.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Considering an increasingly uncomfortable and world-weary Ange Postecoglou has spent the past month throwing esoteric smoke bombs at questions about his future it hardly seems surprising that on Wednesday he announced his resignation as Socceroos coach. A bigger shock would have been to hear that he was staying on. Nevertheless, on the surface, his decision to leave the Socceroos a week after overseeing their qualification for the 2018 World Cup in Russia doesn’t make a lot of sense. Though it may be disingenuous on his part – given that he would have been heavily involved in all manner of discussions with Postecoglou over the past weeks and, indeed, years – even Football Federation Australia CEO David Gallop conceded this morning that he too was “puzzled” by it. For most of us in the cheap seats it does indeed seem odd. You go to the back-breaking trouble of tearing down and then rebuilding a playing style in-line with an aspirational philosophy, you scour the world for overlooked Australian talent, you soak through business shirts from Kazakhstan to Bangkok, and you make yourself the target of the slings and arrows of both outrageous fortune and look-at-me punditry; and you do this all in the hope of steering your team to the World Cup finals, football’s biggest stage. But then just when you’ve done the hardest bit, just when you’ve got them over the line despite all the public challenges and personal sacrifices along the way, you chuck it all in. This isn’t the way these things normally happen. Coaches resign all the time, of course, but usually only when they notice the axe glinting above their heads. One suspects we’ve a lot to learn yet abut the dynamic between Postecoglou and his employers at FFA but there’s no suggestion at this time that Postecoglou’s position was in jeopardy.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Considering an increasingly uncomfortable and world-weary Ange Postecoglou has spent the past month throwing esoteric smoke bombs at questions about his future it hardly seems surprising that on Wednesday he announced his resignation as Socceroos coach. A bigger shock would have been to hear that he was staying on. Nevertheless, on the surface, his decision to leave the Socceroos a week after overseeing their qualification for the 2018 World Cup in Russia doesn’t make a lot of sense. Though it may be disingenuous on his part – given that he would have been heavily involved in all manner of discussions with Postecoglou over the past weeks and, indeed, years – even Football Federation Australia CEO David Gallop conceded this morning that he too was “puzzled” by it. For most of us in the cheap seats it does indeed seem odd. You go to the back-breaking trouble of tearing down and then rebuilding a playing style in-line with an aspirational philosophy, you scour the world for overlooked Australian talent, you soak through business shirts from Kazakhstan to Bangkok, and you make yourself the target of the slings and arrows of both outrageous fortune and look-at-me punditry; and you do this all in the hope of steering your team to the World Cup finals, football’s biggest stage. But then just when you’ve done the hardest bit, just when you’ve got them over the line despite all the public challenges and personal sacrifices along the way, you chuck it all in. This isn’t the way these things normally happen. Coaches resign all the time, of course, but usually only when they notice the axe glinting above their heads. One suspects we’ve a lot to learn yet abut the dynamic between Postecoglou and his employers at FFA but there’s no suggestion at this time that Postecoglou’s position was in jeopardy.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.  Answer with less than 262 words. Include keywords ['bedroom', 'comparison', 'entry', 'leave', 'politics'] in the response.",

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me see, the user provided the beginning sentences from The Guardian about Ange Postecoglou resigning as Socceroos coach. My task is to create a concise summary under 262 words and include specific keywords: 'bedroom', 'comparison', 'entry', 'leave', 'politics'.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the provided text to understand the main points. Postecoglou resigned after securing World Cup qualification, which is puzzling. He had worked hard rebuilding the team and overlooked talent. Even the FFA CEO was surprised. The article questions the timing of his resignation without any indication of his position being under threat.\n\nNow, the challenge is to incorporate the keywords naturally. 'Leave' is already in the context, so that's straightforward. 'Entry' could refer to the World Cup as the biggest stage. 'Politics' might relate to the dynamics between Postecoglou and FFA. 'Comparison' can be used to contrast his resignation with typical scenarios where coaches leave due to pressure. 'Bedroom' is tricky here, but perhaps used metaphorically, like making a decision in private discussions.\n\nI'll structure the summary to first state the resignation, mention the puzzlement, touch on his efforts, the CEO's reaction, and then weave in the keywords. I need to ensure it flows smoothly without forced keyword placement.\n\nLet me draft it step by step. Start with the resignation and the unexpected timing. Then, his efforts and achievements. Mention Gallop's puzzled reaction. Highlight the unusual nature of the resignation without any obvious threats to his position. Then, bring in the 'politics' aspect between him and FFA. In 'comparison' to usual resignations, this stands out. Finally, tie it with 'entry' to the World Cup and a metaphorical 'bedroom' decision.\n\nI need to keep it concise and under the word limit. Let me check the word count and ensure all keywords are included without making it seem forced.\n",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Patients are being put at risk because doctors are giving them drugs they do not need and sending them for unnecessary surgery to avoid a complaint being made against them, research has revealed. Medics are so scared of being complained about that they are also giving patients more tests than their symptoms merit and not performing procedures that involve more risk than usual. Four out of five doctors who become the subject of a complaint find the experience so stressful that they start practising more “defensive medicine” than before, according to a survey of 6,144 doctors in Britain about whom a patient, relative or colleague had complained. “This involved ‘hedging’, which includes performing more tests than necessary, over-referral and overprescribing as well as ‘avoidance’, which includes avoiding procedures, not accepting high-risk patients or abandoning procedures early,” according to research by a team led by Prof Tom Bourne of Imperial College London, whose findings have been published in the journal BMJ Open. “These behaviours may have a serious impact on patient care,” they warned. While litigation, complaints and investigations are intended to protect patients from poor care and medical negligence, the “burden and stress associated with these processes are clearly having unintended consequences and it may be argued that when examined as a whole, these structures may be causing more harm to patient care than good,” the study said. “While the regulatory system may protect patients from the misconduct of a relatively small number of doctors, it has a perverse effect on the majority of doctors who become preoccupied by defensive practice,” it added. Doctors who resort to “fear-driven working practices that could compromise patient care” also waste vital resources and their conduct “creates significant costs for the NHS”, the co-authors added. Bourne could not quantify how much NHS spending goes on that, but pointed to a study that found such practices accounted for 10% of Italy’s health budget. The General Medical Council, which regulates Britain’s 250,000 doctors, receives 9,000-10,000 complaints a year.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

This leads to unnecessary tests, surgeries, and avoidance of high-risk patients, which can harm patient care and increase costs for the NHS.\n\nNext, I need to create a summary that meets their structure. They want a title in double angular brackets, four sections each marked clearly, and to include those keywords. I'll start with a strong title that captures the essence of the issue.\n\nNow, thinking about the keywords. 'Due' can fit when talking about defensive medicine being due to fear. 'Green' isn't directly related, so maybe use it metaphorically, like a green flag for solutions. 'Storm' can describe the legal climate. 'Tackle' fits with addressing the problem, and 'tonight' can emphasize the immediate need for action.\n\nI'll structure each section to cover different aspects: the issue itself, examples of defensive medicine behaviors, the study's warning, and the call to action. I'll make sure each section flows logically and incorporates the keywords seamlessly without forcing them.\n\nFinally, I'll put it all together, ensuring the summary is concise, includes all required elements, and maintains a natural flow.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Nick Xenophon Team senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore will resign from the Senate because she has dual British citizenship by descent through her mother. At a press conference in Adelaide on Wednesday, Kakoschke-Moore announced she had received advice from the UK Home Office on Friday, confirmed by a specialist barrister, that she had received British citizenship from her mother, who was born in Singapore in 1957. Kakoschke-Moore had always believed she was not British because her father had received advice from the British embassy in Oman she was not eligible for citizenship when she was 12. She said she was “heartbroken” to discover she was British, which she described as “extremely surprising” because she “had no reason to believe I was a British citizen until that point”. Kakoschke-Moore explained that her mother was born in Singapore, a former British colony, which gave her “citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies” and became a British citizen in 1983 when the British Nationality Act came into effect. Kakoschke-Moore, born in Darwin in 1985, then gained that citizenship by descent. Kakoschke-Moore said she would request the matter be referred to the high court to determine how the vacancy would be filled, adding she would “continue to run” for the NXT and “at this stage” her ambition was to come back to the Senate. A recount of the 2016 Senate election would likely elect the NXT candidate Tim Storrer, who unsuccessfully attempted to replace Xenophon in the Senate by challenging the party’s chosen successor. Xenophon said he and his colleagues were “devastated” by the loss of Kakoschke-Moore from the Senate, but predicted it was “not the end of her political career”. Xenophon said the party had preliminary legal advice the position may not be filled by a recount, claiming the situation was “uncharted legal territory” because of the high court’s recent decision involving Hollie Hughes.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Nick Xenophon Team senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore will resign from the Senate because she has dual British citizenship by descent through her mother. At a press conference in Adelaide on Wednesday, Kakoschke-Moore announced she had received advice from the UK Home Office on Friday, confirmed by a specialist barrister, that she had received British citizenship from her mother, who was born in Singapore in 1957. Kakoschke-Moore had always believed she was not British because her father had received advice from the British embassy in Oman she was not eligible for citizenship when she was 12. She said she was “heartbroken” to discover she was British, which she described as “extremely surprising” because she “had no reason to believe I was a British citizen until that point”. Kakoschke-Moore explained that her mother was born in Singapore, a former British colony, which gave her “citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies” and became a British citizen in 1983 when the British Nationality Act came into effect. Kakoschke-Moore, born in Darwin in 1985, then gained that citizenship by descent. Kakoschke-Moore said she would request the matter be referred to the high court to determine how the vacancy would be filled, adding she would “continue to run” for the NXT and “at this stage” her ambition was to come back to the Senate. A recount of the 2016 Senate election would likely elect the NXT candidate Tim Storrer, who unsuccessfully attempted to replace Xenophon in the Senate by challenging the party’s chosen successor. Xenophon said he and his colleagues were “devastated” by the loss of Kakoschke-Moore from the Senate, but predicted it was “not the end of her political career”. Xenophon said the party had preliminary legal advice the position may not be filled by a recount, claiming the situation was “uncharted legal territory” because of the high court’s recent decision involving Hollie Hughes.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, let's see. I have this query from a user who wants a summary of a news article from The Guardian. The provided text is about a senator resigning due to dual citizenship. Hmm, the senator is Skye Kakoschke-Moore, and she's stepping down because she found out she has British citizenship through her mother.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the main points accurately. She discovered her citizenship status via the UK Home Office and a barrister. She had always thought she wasn't British, based on advice her father got when she was younger. Now she's heartbroken and it's a surprise to her.\n\nHer mother was born in Singapore, which is a former British colony, and that gave her UK citizenship. Then Skye inherited it. She's resigning, asking the high court to decide on the vacancy. She wants to continue running for her party, NXT, and hopes to return. \n\nThere's a mention of a possible recount, and Tim Storrer might take her place, though there's some legal uncertainty because of a recent high court decision. Nick Xenophon is supporting her, saying it's not the end of her career.\n\nI should make sure the summary is concise, captures all key points without extra details. Also, the user specified JSON format with a \"summary\" key, so I'll structure it that way. I'll avoid certain keywords like 'command' or 'welcome', so I need to be careful with word choice.\n\nWait, is there any mention of why she had the advice from the British embassy when she was 12? Maybe her father checked before, but now it's different. I'll include that she was surprised because she had no reason to believe she was British before.\n\nAlso, the legal implications about the recount and the uncertainty due to the high court’s decision on Hollie Hughes. Xenophon says it's uncharted territory, so that's important to note.\n\nI should make sure the JSON is properly formatted, with the summary as a string, and avoid any markdown since the user mentioned not to use it. Alright, putting it all together now.\n",

Speaking at his Papitalai parish church on Los Negros Island, across a small bay from the detention centre, Taulam said the enforced shutdown of the centre – in which 380 men remain – had left people vulnerable and suffering. Over years of pastoral care, he has built up friendships with many of those in the centre, he told the Guardian and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. “Now when they say they have no food, no water, no lights, they are deprived physically but they are saying too, that the physical is also spiritual for them. They are deprived of faith. They are suffering.” Taulam said no government seemed willing to take care of the men who remain in the centre. “Australia seems to be saying, ‘Papua New Guinea, this is your responsibility’.

    "response":"\n\n\"Late last year, the Electoral Commission initiated an investigation into a concerning situation involving Steve Baker MP, who, in February 2016, sent an email lobbying for Vote Leave to be designated the official leave campaign. Baker claimed that Vote Leave had discovered a loophole in spending rules, suggesting that the campaign could create separate legal entities to spend up to £700,000 each, allowing it to exceed legal limits. However, this claim was later found to be incorrect, as the law prohibits such actions, effectively making the behavior illegal.\n\n***  \nThe email, reported in *The Times*, revealed that Vote Leave had contemplated acting unlawfully by exploiting legal loopholes to circumvent spending restrictions. Despite this, the Electoral Commission still designated Vote Leave as the official leave campaign, raising questions about the integrity of the process. Baker, who is now a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU), was central to this controversy, highlighting the potential for undue influence over the referendum outcome.\n\n***  \nDuring the referendum campaign, Vote Leave faced legal spending limits but had significant funds remaining from wealthy donors. This created a situation where the campaign could potentially exploit loopholes to exceed spending restrictions, further undermining the democratic process. The Electoral Commission's decision to grant Vote Leave official status despite knowing about the email has drawn scrutiny, as it appears to have overlooked evidence of potential wrongdoing.\n\n***  \nThe investigation by the Electoral Commission has brought to light serious concerns about the integrity of the referendum process, particularly how Vote Leave sought to manipulate spending rules to gain an unfair advantage. The case underscores the need for robust oversight to prevent the manipulation of democratic processes and ensure transparency in political campaigns.\"",

    "filtered_answer":"\n\n\"Late last year, the Electoral Commission initiated an investigation into a concerning situation involving Steve Baker MP, who, in February 2016, sent an email lobbying for Vote Leave to be designated the official leave campaign. Baker claimed that Vote Leave had discovered a loophole in spending rules, suggesting that the campaign could create separate legal entities to spend up to £700,000 each, allowing it to exceed legal limits. However, this claim was later found to be incorrect, as the law prohibits such actions, effectively making the behavior illegal.\n\n***  \nThe email, reported in *The Times*, revealed that Vote Leave had contemplated acting unlawfully by exploiting legal loopholes to circumvent spending restrictions. Despite this, the Electoral Commission still designated Vote Leave as the official leave campaign, raising questions about the integrity of the process. Baker, who is now a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU), was central to this controversy, highlighting the potential for undue influence over the referendum outcome.\n\n***  \nDuring the referendum campaign, Vote Leave faced legal spending limits but had significant funds remaining from wealthy donors. This created a situation where the campaign could potentially exploit loopholes to exceed spending restrictions, further undermining the democratic process. The Electoral Commission's decision to grant Vote Leave official status despite knowing about the email has drawn scrutiny, as it appears to have overlooked evidence of potential wrongdoing.\n\n***  \nThe investigation by the Electoral Commission has brought to light serious concerns about the integrity of the referendum process, particularly how Vote Leave sought to manipulate spending rules to gain an unfair advantage. The case underscores the need for robust oversight to prevent the manipulation of democratic processes and ensure transparency in political campaigns.\"",

His appointment, announced by the cabinet on Wednesday, aims to address concerns about religious amendments in the same-sex marriage bill and prevent a contentious debate. Treasurer Scott Morrison emphasized that this review is not a substitute for including such amendments in the marriage legislation.\n\n***\n\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull stated that the review is necessary to carefully examine the issue of religious freedom, particularly in light of the public's \"yes\" vote on same-sex marriage and the upcoming legislation on marriage equality. Senior conservatives, such as Peter Dutton and Mathias Cormann, have suggested that a religious freedom bill could be considered separately next year. However, others, including Morrison and Liberal Senator David Fawcett, argue that it should be addressed simultaneously with the marriage bill.\n\n***\n\nRuddock has been tasked with submitting his report by 31 March. Turnbull noted that various proposals for legislative changes to protect religious freedom have been put forward in recent months, but many of these proposals extend beyond the immediate issue of marriage. He cautioned that parliament must be mindful of the broader implications and potential unintended consequences of such reforms.\n\n***\n\nTurnbull expressed concern about the risks of legislating protections for basic rights and freedoms, such as religious freedom, particularly when bills are vaguely worded. He highlighted the government's desire to avoid uncertainties caused by overly broad declarations. He described Ruddock's review as a \"timely expert stocktake\" to inform any necessary legislative reforms.\n\n***\n\nThe prime minister defended Ruddock's appointment, pointing to his experience as Australia’s special envoy for human rights. This review is seen as an effort to balance the government's commitment to marriage equality with the concerns of those advocating for stronger protections for religious freedom.

I should note the differing opinions within the party, with some wanting to handle it separately and others wanting it done together. Also, Ruddock's deadline is March 31, which is important.\n\nThen, Prime Minister Turnbull emphasizes careful consideration of religious freedom post the yes vote on same-sex marriage.

    "filtered_answer":"\n\nThe former Liberal minister Philip Ruddock has been appointed to review whether Australian law adequately protects the human right to religious freedom. His appointment, announced by the cabinet on Wednesday, aims to address concerns about religious amendments in the same-sex marriage bill and prevent a contentious debate. Treasurer Scott Morrison emphasized that this review is not a substitute for including such amendments in the marriage legislation.\n\n***\n\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull stated that the review is necessary to carefully examine the issue of religious freedom, particularly in light of the public's \"yes\" vote on same-sex marriage and the upcoming legislation on marriage equality. Senior conservatives, such as Peter Dutton and Mathias Cormann, have suggested that a religious freedom bill could be considered separately next year. However, others, including Morrison and Liberal Senator David Fawcett, argue that it should be addressed simultaneously with the marriage bill.\n\n***\n\nRuddock has been tasked with submitting his report by 31 March. Turnbull noted that various proposals for legislative changes to protect religious freedom have been put forward in recent months, but many of these proposals extend beyond the immediate issue of marriage. He cautioned that parliament must be mindful of the broader implications and potential unintended consequences of such reforms.\n\n***\n\nTurnbull expressed concern about the risks of legislating protections for basic rights and freedoms, such as religious freedom, particularly when bills are vaguely worded. He highlighted the government's desire to avoid uncertainties caused by overly broad declarations. He described Ruddock's review as a \"timely expert stocktake\" to inform any necessary legislative reforms.\n\n***\n\nThe prime minister defended Ruddock's appointment, pointing to his experience as Australia’s special envoy for human rights. This review is seen as an effort to balance the government's commitment to marriage equality with the concerns of those advocating for stronger protections for religious freedom. The outcome of the review will likely shape the direction of future legislative reforms in this area.",

It uses vivid, humorous language to describe the formulaic and often cringeworthy nature of these programs. The shows are portrayed as overly focused on banter, questionable fashion choices, and awkward interactions between hosts and guests. For instance, the description of Tim Lovejoy in \"distressed chambray\" and his repetitive use of the word \"yeah\" highlights the show's forced camaraderie and lack of genuine creativity.\n\nThe text also mocks the culinary elements of these programs, such as scallops in \"chino runoff\" and steak in \"Lynx Sport Blast® reduction,\" suggesting that the dishes are more about gimmicks than actual culinary artistry. The mention of Jerusalem artichokes serves as a metaphor for the shows' propensity to focus on obscure or pretentious ingredients, leaving viewers baffled. The overall tone implies that these programs prioritize style over substance, relying on tired formats rather than innovative ideas.\n\nIn addition to the cookery shows, the text critiques another genre it refers to as the \"Costume Romp,\" which seems to describe period dramas or historical productions. It uses exaggerated language to mock the over-the-top performances, costumes, and plots, likening them to a chaotic and absurd spectacle. The phrase \"priapic jackanapes prithee-ing around in peephole codpieces\" suggests a focus on ridiculous humor and overly dramatic or inappropriate content.\n\nThe text does not explicitly mention an *annual* event, a *cousin*, or a *creative* figure, but it could be interpreted as a broader commentary on the *annual* cycles of these shows, which repeat the same formulas year after year. The *cousin* might symbolize the audience or a secondary figure in the production, while the *creative* figure could refer to the hosts or producers who struggle to innovate. The word \"suck\" is not directly used, but the tone of the text implies that these shows often fail to deliver quality content, relying instead on cringeworthy humor and tired tropes.\n\nOverall, the text is a scathing critique of formulaic television programming, highlighting the lack of originality and the overemphasis on superficial elements like fashion and banter. It uses hyperbole and absurd imagery to emphasize the monotony and absurdity of these shows, urging viewers to question their appeal. The inclusion of keywords like \"annual,\" \"cousin,\" \"creative,\" and \"suck\" could be seen as a way to further emphasize the repetitive nature of these programs and their failure to engage audiences meaningfully.\n\nThe text also suggests that the shows' reliance on familiar formats and personalities has become stale, leaving little room for genuine *creative* expression.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so the user provided a query where they want a summary of the beginning sentences from a Guardian article. They also specified including certain keywords: 'annual', 'cousin', 'creative', 'figure', 'suck'. The response should be at least 17 sentences long. \n\nFirst, I'll need to understand the content of the provided text. It seems to be a satirical critique of TV cooking shows. The language is rich with metaphors and humorous jabs at the format and hosts of these programs. \n\nNext, I should break down the key elements to summarize. The main points are the critique of cooking shows as formulaic and lacking substance, the hosts' behavior, and a side note on a costume drama, which might be a secondary focus.\n\nNow, I need to incorporate the keywords naturally. 'Annual' could relate to the shows being a regular event. 'Cousin' might refer to a relative involved in production or someone connected to the shows. 'Creative' can describe the approach of the shows, albeit lacking. 'Figure' can be used to discuss the hosts as prominent figures. 'Suck' can be colloquially used to express criticism towards the shows' quality.\n\nI must ensure that the summary is coherent and flows well, connecting the critique of the cooking shows with the mention of the costume romp. Also, each keyword should fit seamlessly without feeling forced. \n\nI'll start by summarizing the overall tone and target of the text, then delve into specific elements like the hosts' attire and dialogues. Then, I'll touch on the other genre mentioned, the costume romp, and how it's portrayed satirically. Finally, I'll incorporate the keywords in the conclusion to tie everything together, ensuring the summary meets the 17-sentence requirement.\n\nI should also double-check that the keywords are included and that each sentence adds value to the summary, maintaining the satirical and critical tone of the original text. Making sure not to miss any key points from the provided sentences is crucial for accuracy.\n",

Keeping it concise and within one paragraph is crucial here.\n\nI also need to make sure that the summary flows well and includes all the important details without being too wordy.

I should include specific figures like the number of employees and the financial details to give the summary depth.\n\nAdditionally, I have to ensure that the information about Charles Wade and the structure of the companies is clear, explaining that Multiyork and Feather & Black operate separately. This helps in clarifying why only Multiyork is affected. Mentioning the historical background, like when the company was founded and rescued, adds context.\n\nFinally, I'll wrap it up by noting that the administrators are continuing to seek a buyer, which provides a sense of the current situation and possible future developments.

Despite a 5.4% increase in sales to £50.4m in the 53 weeks to October 2016, the company recorded a modest profit of £479,000 after a £714,000 loss the previous year. Administrators have stated that Multiyork's financial liabilities and trading losses led to its downfall, with net debt standing at £1.9m at the end of 2016. While the business will continue to operate temporarily, administrators are seeking a buyer to rescue the company.",

The user also mentioned some specific instructions: not to include certain keywords and to structure the response into two paragraphs using a markdown divider. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content of the provided text. It seems to be discussing the decline of computing education in schools. The first part talks about the 1970s when computing was first introduced and how engaged students were, even with basic programming. Then, it laments how educational experts shifted focus to IT skills like using Office software, which led to the decline of computer studies.\n\nI should make sure the summary captures both the historical aspect and the critique of the shift in education. The user doesn't want certain keywords, so I must avoid those. Also, they want two paragraphs separated by a divider. \n\nI need to be concise and ensure each paragraph flows well. The first paragraph can focus on the initial success and decline, while the second can address the broader implications and the need for a more comprehensive approach. \n\nI should also avoid using any markdown in the thinking process since it's just for myself, but remember to include the divider in the final response. \n\nLastly, I'll make sure the language is clear and summarizes the key points without introducing new information or the forbidden keywords. \n\nTime to put it all together and double-check to make sure I'm following all the instructions correctly.\n",

    "response":"\n\nThe Guardian article discusses the concerns of traditional cider makers regarding a new tax on super-strength cider announced in the budget. The Treasury introduced a new duty band targeting still cider and perry with an alcohol content between 6.9% and 7.5%, aiming to address the issue of cheap, high-strength \"white cider,\" which is often linked to alcohol misuse among vulnerable populations. However, traditional cider makers argue that this legislation unfairly impacts their craft, as many of their products fall within the targeted range. They emphasize that their ciders are made from whole fruit, unlike large-scale producers who use concentrates, and warn that the tax could harm their businesses without effectively addressing the intended problem.\n\nBothered by the potential consequences, smaller cider makers like Arfur Daley of Gwatkin Cider and Neil Worley of Worley’s Cider highlight the disparity between artisanal producers and large manufacturers. Daley points out that larger cider makers, who use concentrates, will not be significantly affected, while smaller, traditional producers will face financial pressure. Worley adds that white cider firms could simply reformulate their products to 6.9% alcohol content to avoid the higher tax, making the policy’s impact negligible.

The debate highlights the challenges of balancing public health concerns with the economic realities of the cider industry.

Traditional cider makers are concerned because the new tax targets ciders between 6.9% and 7.5% ABV, which includes their products. They argue that this will affect them but not the larger producers or white cider makers who can adjust their formulations.\n\nNext, I need to incorporate the required keywords naturally. 'Background' can set the context. 'Battle' fits well when talking about the conflict between traditional and white cider makers. 'Look' can express how smaller producers view the situation. 'Purchase' relates to price points, and 'wall' can describe the barrier created by the legislation.\n\nI should ensure the summary has three clear paragraphs. The first paragraph sets up the situation, the second (starting with 'bother') discusses the concerns from both sides, and the third wraps up with the criticism and possible loopholes.\n\nI also need to make sure the language is clear and concise, accurately reflecting the article's content while seamlessly integrating the keywords.\n\nNow, I'll draft the summary, making sure each paragraph serves its purpose and the keywords are included without forced placement.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so the user has given me a query from the Guardian, which is the beginning of a news article. They want me to summarize it in two different ways. Let me read the text again to make sure I get all the details.\n\nThe text talks about three main things: a standup show by Paul Foot, a love for a character from The League of Gentlemen, a book called Infinite Jest, and a film Withnail and I. Each of these is described as the funniest in their respective categories.\n\nFirst, for the summary, I need to extract the key points. Paul Foot's private show is unique because he seats the audience himself and makes jokes about each person. That's a pretty personal and funny experience. The person also mentions a character named Pauline and her pens from a specific TV show, and they want to attend something called Job Seekers with Mickey Love. Maybe that's a reference to another comedy show or a play.\n\nNext, they talk about the book Infinite Jest. It's not just funny but also profound and insane. The way the book is structured with footnotes and reading forwards and backwards sounds complex but thrilling. That's an interesting aspect because it's not every day a book combines humor with such an unconventional reading method.\n\nFinally, they mention the film Withnail and I, which is a cult classic. They note the drinking game associated with it but mention they've never done it and don't think they ever will. Drinking butane lighter fluid isn't something people usually do, so that's a funny and dangerous reference.\n\nNow, I need to create two different summaries. The first one can focus on the unique experiences and the books. The second could vary by emphasizing the insane nature of the book and the drinking game from the film.\n\nI should keep each summary concise and make sure to highlight different aspects. Maybe in the first summary, I can talk about the personalized standup, the character love, the book's uniqueness, and the film's iconic status. In the second, perhaps I can stress the profoundness of the book and the dangerous humor in the film.\n\nI also need to make sure the two summaries are distinct enough. So, varying the adjectives and the structure a bit will help. One might start with the standup, the other with the book.\n\nFinally, I must ensure that both summaries are clear and capture the essence of the original text without being repetitive. Let me check each point to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nAlright, I think I have a good plan for both summaries. Time to put it together.\n",

A colleague tweeted a picture of it that went viral. We noticed it after arriving at hospital with a patient in a critical condition. It had been our first job of the day and when we had pulled up outside the property, people were waiting outside to meet us. I could tell from the expression of one man that he was very concerned. We weren’t going to be at the scene for long. The patient was vomiting blood. I told my colleague to get a stretcher. We usually take a measured approach to parking but with an incident like this we want to know what is going on before looking for a parking space that could see us backtracking 200-300 metres.

A colleague tweeted the picture, which went viral. They were at the hospital with a critical patient when they noticed the note. The patient had vomited blood, so they had to act quickly. The crew usually parks carefully but in emergencies, they prioritize patient care over parking. The road was double-parked, and the paramedic can't remember if they blocked the drive. They were focused on the emergency, not parking. The note caused a mix of reactions, with some supporting the crew and others the note-writer. It highlights challenges like finding parking in emergencies. Sometimes, they park where they can to save time. Blocking a driveway might be necessary in critical moments. Paramedics are often under stress, balancing急救 with other factors. The viral tweet drew attention to public behavior during emergencies. The crew was surprised their colleague's tweet went viral. The incident also sparked debate about parking in such situations. Quick action is crucial in emergencies, sometimes without time to find alternative parking. The crew's priority is treating patients, not parking. They sometimes block driveways but try to do so only when necessary. Paramedics believe people need to understand the urgency of their work.

The UK's productivity growth, which had steadily improved over the past century through better machines, skilled workers, and efficient production, began to falter.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, I need to tackle this query step by step. The user provided a news article snippet from The Guardian about the 2017 UK budget and the Suez crisis. They want a summary that includes specific keywords: 'bird', 'commercial', 'method', 'possession', and 'proof'. \n\nFirst, I'll read the provided sentences carefully. The main points are the comparison of the 2017 budget to the Suez crisis, indicating a decline in Britain's economic power. The key issues are the economy's worsening state, productivity stagnation, and the OBR's ominous forecast.\n\nNext, I need to incorporate the keywords naturally. 'Commercial' can refer to commercial interests or trade implications. 'Method' and 'possession' might relate to Britain's approach or assets. 'Bird' is tricky—it doesn't fit directly, so I'll use 'bird's-eye view' metaphorically. 'Proof' can highlight the evidence of decline.\n\nI'll structure the summary to first present the Suez crisis as a historical marker, then the 2017 budget as an economic equivalent. Then, discuss the productivity issues and the OBR's report as proof of decline. Mentioning commercial practices and using 'bird's-eye view' to provide perspective ties in the keywords.\n\nFinally, in the postscript, I'll list all the keywords used to confirm they're included. I'll make sure the summary is concise and flows well, hitting all the required points without forcing the keywords awkwardly.\n",

They were able to snap his photo with the loot without him even noticing,” the sheriff said at the time. And in Purcell, Oklahoma, Steven Walker, who lived alone, said he was surprised to return from a doctor’s appointment and discover a stranger in his home.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"\n\nInjury to expectation, Björk’s latest album, *Utopia*, defies predictability while offering a breath of fresh air after the emotionally heavy *Vulnicura*. The opening track, *Arisen My Senses*, bursts with vibrancy—birdsongs, electronic splashes, harp chords, and cascading beats that evoke a sense of ecstasy. This stark contrast to the raw, harrowing misery of *Vulnicura* is a relief, as the new album’s lighter, airier sound, enhanced by a 12-piece female flute ensemble, signals a shift from the claustrophobic intensity of its predecessor.\n\n*Utopia* revitalizes Björk’s collaboration with electronic artist Arca, whose distorted beats and manipulated vocal samples create intricate soundscapes. While *Vulnicura* was praised for its brave and challenging nature, its emotional weight made repeated listens daunting. In contrast, *Utopia* feels more approachable, blending woodwind melodies with electronic experimentation to craft a sound that is both innovative and uplifting. Björk describes it as her “Tinder album,” reflecting its themes of modern romance and technological entanglements.\n\nLyrically, *Utopia* delves into the ambiguities of contemporary love and the role of technology in relationships. Tracks like *Blissing Me* explore the tension between digital connection and physical longing, as Björk ponders the complexities of intimacy in the age of screens. The album’s focus on budding romance and its interplay with technology highlights Björk’s ability to weave deeply personal and universally relatable themes into her music, making *Utopia* a compelling follow-up to her critically acclaimed but emotionally taxing previous work.",
    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so the user has provided the beginning of a news article from The Guardian about Björk's album 'Utopia'. Their query is asking me to summarize this excerpt into three paragraphs, with the first paragraph starting with the word \"Injury\". They also mentioned that each paragraph should be separated by two new lines, similar to '\\n\\n' in Python.\n\nHmm, looking at their example response, I see they've structured it into three clear parts. The first starts with \"Injury to expectation\", which is a creative way to meet the requirement. The second paragraph discusses the contrast between 'Utopia' and the previous album, and the third talks about the album's themes.\n\nI need to make sure I capture the main points: the change in sound from Vulnicura, the use of woodwind, collaboration with Arca, and the themes of technology and romance. Also, the first word of the first paragraph must be \"Injury\".\n\nI should start by highlighting how 'Utopia' differs from the previous work, then delve into the musical elements and collaboration, and finally touch on the lyrical content. Ensuring each paragraph flows naturally and adheres to the structure the user wants is key.\n\nI wonder if the user is perhaps a student working on a music assignment or a journalist needing a summary. They might need this for a presentation or an article they're writing. Either way, clarity and conciseness are important.\n\nI need to avoid just copying the example but instead rephrase the points in my own words while maintaining the structure and starting the first paragraph correctly. Making sure each paragraph is distinct and covers specific aspects will be crucial. Let me break down the content:\n\n1. How 'Utopia' is different and the initial reaction to it.\n2. The musical elements and contributors.\n3. The themes and lyrics.\n\nAlright, I'll draft each paragraph with these focuses, ensuring the first starts with \"Injury\" and each subsequent paragraph is separated properly. I also need to keep it around the same length as the example to maintain balance.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, I need to figure out how to summarize the given news article excerpt and then determine which of the three response options is appropriate. The options are 'My answer is yes.', 'My answer is no.', and 'My answer is maybe.' \n\nFirst, I'll read the article carefully. It's about Jeff Stelling, a Sky Sports presenter known for being cheerful. He had a moment where he went on a rant about expected goals, a statistic he called the most useless in football. He criticized Arsène Wenger for quoting expected goals, which he found pointless, especially after a game has ended. His rant caused laughter in the studio and online.\n\nSo the task is to summarize this. The summary should capture that Stelling criticized expected goals, called them useless, and that his comments were humorous and viral. \n\nNow, I need to decide which of the three options the user expects as a response. The initial instruction says to answer with one of the options, but it's not clear what the question is that these options are responding to. Since the user only provided the instruction for summarization and to choose an option, I need to infer the question. Perhaps the user is asking for a factual check on something related to the article. For example, they might be asking if Stelling supports expected goals.\n\nLooking back at the article, Stelling clearly criticizes expected goals, calling them useless. Therefore, if the question was, \"Does Jeff Stelling think expected goals are useful?\", the answer would be no. Hence, 'My answer is no.'\n\nAlternatively, if the question was whether he went on a rant or made the comments public, the answer would also be yes, but based on the article, the primary sentiment is negative towards expected goals, so the appropriate response is 'no.'\n\nI should make sure not to overcomplicate it. The key point is his dismissal of expected goals, so if the question is about his support or belief in their usefulness, the answer is 'no.' \n\nTherefore, after considering all this, I should select 'My answer is no.' as the appropriate response.\n",

Hammond’s colleagues used the first of four days of scheduled debate about the budget to praise not just his high-profile announcements on housing, but also his commitment of £3bn to prepare for any Brexit eventuality. In his response to the budget, Corbyn – it is the leader of the opposition who traditionally speaks rather than the shadow chancellor – said Hammond had completely failed to tackle a national crisis of stagnation and falling wages. “The test of a budget is how it affects the reality of people’s lives all around this country,” the Labour leader said. “And I believe as the days go ahead, and this budget unravels, the reality will be – a lot of people will be no better off. And the misery that many are in will be continuing.” Largely eschewing direct focus on Hammond’s specific announcements in favour of a broader critique of the government’s wider economic approach, Corbyn castigated Hammond for again missing deficit reduction targets, and for a continued spending squeeze on schools and the police. Speaking about housing, Corbyn said rough sleeping had doubled since 2010, and that this Christmas 120,000 children would be living in temporary accommodation. “We need a large-scale publicly funded housebuilding programme, not this government’s accounting tricks and empty promises.”Summing up, he said: “We were promised a revolutionary budget.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user provided a query with a news excerpt and some specific instructions.

Also, the response should be at least three sentences, wrapped in double quotes, and start with 'ticket' in the first paragraph. The response should be one paragraph separated by two new lines.\n\nHmm, the keywords are a bit tricky. Let me see how to incorporate them naturally. 'Chart' could refer to the budget's direction or a visual representation. 'Departure' might indicate a change in approach from the previous year. 'Push' could relate to Corbyn's efforts or the government's strategy. 'Republic' isn't directly in the text, maybe a stretch, but perhaps used metaphorically. 'Rest' might refer to the remaining issues not addressed.\n\nI need to make sure the summary starts with 'ticket', perhaps in the context of the budget being a ticket to improving lives or not. The Conservative MPs are endorsing Hammond, contrasting with last year's reservations. Corbyn is criticizing, focusing on stagnation and wages. He talks about housing issues—rough sleeping and temporary accommodations. So, I can highlight the push for publicly funded housing.\n\nIn the summary, I'll mention Hammond's Brexit preparation funds as a departure from previous budgets. The chart of the budget shows a missed opportunity. Corbyn's push for a housebuilding program as a departure from the current approach. Lastly, the republic of ideologies emphasizes help for the rest, indicating his focus on those struggling.\n\nI should structure this into a concise paragraph, making sure each keyword is naturally included without forcing them.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Ships and planes hunting for an Argentinian submarine that went missing in the south Atlantic a week ago are to return to a previously searched area as relatives of those onboard voiced their frustrations with rescue efforts. An Argentinian navy spokesman, Captain Enrique Balbi, said search teams would return to the area about 30 miles north of the ARA San Juan’s last registered position after a “hydro-acoustic anomaly” was determined by the US and specialist agencies to have been produced just hours after the final contact with the submarine on 15 November. “It’s a noise. We don’t want to speculate” about what caused it, Balbi said. With the seven-day limit on the ARA San Juan’s oxygen reserves having been reached on Wednesday morning, what hopes that remain are pinned on the submarine having been able to replenish its oxygen supply by surfacing at some point during the past week. Helena Alfaro was just one of many family members who congregated at the Mar del Plata naval base where the submarine was originally scheduled to arrive on Monday. “I feel like I’m waiting for a corpse,” said Alfaro, the sister of Cristian Ibañez, a radar officer on the missing submarine. “So much protocol, so much protocol,” she complained to TN news network, referring to the Argentinian navy’s long delay in advising the president, Mauricio Macri, that it had lost contact with the submarine. Justifying the delay, navy chiefs said that military protocol advises a 48-hour waiting period before beginning search efforts for submarines lost at sea. “I feel like I’m at a wake, that’s how I feel,” said a tearful Alfaro.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

An Argentinian navy spokesman, Captain Enrique Balbi, said search teams would return to the area about 30 miles north of the ARA San Juan’s last registered position after a “hydro-acoustic anomaly” was determined by the US and specialist agencies to have been produced just hours after the final contact with the submarine on 15 November. “It’s a noise. We don’t want to speculate” about what caused it, Balbi said. With the seven-day limit on the ARA San Juan’s oxygen reserves having been reached on Wednesday morning, what hopes that remain are pinned on the submarine having been able to replenish its oxygen supply by surfacing at some point during the past week. Helena Alfaro was just one of many family members who congregated at the Mar del Plata naval base where the submarine was originally scheduled to arrive on Monday. “I feel like I’m waiting for a corpse,” said Alfaro, the sister of Cristian Ibañez, a radar officer on the missing submarine. “So much protocol, so much protocol,” she complained to TN news network, referring to the Argentinian navy’s long delay in advising the president, Mauricio Macri, that it had lost contact with the submarine. Justifying the delay, navy chiefs said that military protocol advises a 48-hour waiting period before beginning search efforts for submarines lost at sea. “I feel like I’m at a wake, that’s how I feel,” said a tearful Alfaro.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through the content again. The article talks about an Argentinian submarine that went missing a week ago. Ships and planes are searching for it, and they're going back to a previously searched area because of some acoustic anomaly detected by the US and other experts. The oxygen supply was supposed to last seven days, so time is critical. Relatives are frustrated, especially with the navy's delay in informing the president. They feel like they're in a mouring situation, waiting for bad news.\n\nI'll need to structure the summary with a title in double angular brackets. The title should capture the essence, maybe something like \"Search for Missing Argentinian Submarine Continues Amid Frustration and Limited Hope.\" That seems accurate because it covers the ongoing search and the emotional state of the families.\n\nIn the body, I should mention the search area change due to the anomaly, the oxygen situation, the relatives' feelings, and the navy's delay explanation. I need to keep it concise but cover all the main points without going into too much detail. I'll paraphrase the key quotes to fit the summary smoothly.\n\nFinally, I'll end with the exact phrase \"Is there anything else I can help with?\" as instructed. Let me make sure the title is in << >> and that the summary flows well, capturing the urgency and the families' frustration. \n\nI think that's a solid plan.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, let's try to understand what the user is asking here. They shared a text that seems to be a personal reflection on ramen, describing its appeal, the experience of eating it, and a brief mention of a recipe tweak using almond milk. They want a summary based on these sentences and then an answer from the options: yes, no, or maybe.\n\nSo, first, I need to figure out what exactly they're asking to summarize. The text provided talks about the author's love for ramen, why it's a complete and satisfying meal, the atmosphere of eating it alone, and a specific cooking tip. It doesn't seem to pose a direct question, but rather expresses a personal sentiment.\n\nNow, the user has instructed to respond with one of the three options. Since the original text doesn’t present a question that requires a yes\/no\/maybe answer, I'm a bit confused. My role is to summarize the text, but then choose between 'My answer is yes', 'My answer is no', or 'My answer is maybe'. \n\nGiven that theGuardian text doesn't ask a question, summarizing it would just be a description. However, the user’s instruction is a bit unclear here. It's possible that the user is trying to test if the AI can recognize whether the text is a question requiring such an answer or not. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking if the text meets certain criteria that would warrant a yes, no, or maybe.\n\nBut without a specific question, it's challenging to apply yes, no, or maybe. Perhaps the user is checking if the text is making a claim that can be affirmed or denied. However, the text is more of a personal narrative without posing a debatable statement.\n\nIn that case, I might have to default to a 'maybe' because there's no clear question to affirm or deny. Alternatively, since there's no basis for a definitive answer, 'maybe' might be the safest choice.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I think the best approach is to provide a summary as instructed and then select 'My answer is maybe.' This acknowledges that without a direct question, it's unclear how to apply yes or no, but maybe there's some implicit question I'm missing.\n",

The original article talks about the summit in Sochi, Putin's role, the involvement of Iran and Turkey, the military developments, and the future of Syria's reconstruction.\n\nI should start by rephrasing the key points. The first paragraph should mention the peace settlement and the necessity of compromise. The second can focus on the summit details and the potential outcome for Assad. Then, perhaps a paragraph on the recent military successes against Islamic State and Putin's declarations. Another paragraph can discuss Putin's diplomatic efforts and his telephone calls with other leaders. Finally, wrap it up with the reconstruction plans and the challenges they face.\n\nI need to ensure each paragraph starts appropriately and they’re all within the word limit. Let me count the sentences to make sure I don’t go over. Also, the structure must be strictly followed—no markdown, just plain text with paragraphs separated by two newlines. I'll make sure to start the first one with \"maintenance\". \n\nOverall, the summary should capture the essence of the article, highlighting Russia's diplomatic efforts, the compromised position of Assad, and the steps toward peace and reconstruction without missing any critical information.\n",
    "filtered_answer":"\n\nMaintenance of a peace settlement in Syria will require compromise from all parties involved, including the Assad government, according to Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader emphasized this as the presidents of Iran and Turkey arrived in Sochi for a summit aimed at paving the way for a settlement likely to keep Bashar al-Assad in power under a reformed constitution.  \n\nThe summit comes after the near-collapse of the Syrian opposition and the military defeat of Islamic State in major towns and cities. Putin highlighted the decisive blow dealt to militants and expressed optimism about ending the six-year civil war. He stressed that the Syrian people must determine their future and agree on statehood principles, acknowledging the difficulty of the reform process.  \n\nPutin hosted Assad in Sochi, securing a more conciliatory tone from the Syrian leader. He emphasized Assad’s commitment to peace, constitutional reform, and free elections. Additionally, Putin engaged in telephone diplomacy with world leaders, including Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, and Donald Trump.  \n\nThe Russian leader urged Iran and Turkey to discuss Syria’s reconstruction, given the enormous scale of destruction. He called for a comprehensive program to address the country’s development needs.  \n\nThe summit reflects Russia’s assertive diplomatic efforts to shape Syria’s future, leveraging its military intervention and the weakening of opposition forces. The outcome may solidify Assad’s position while introducing reforms, but the path forward remains fraught with challenges.",

    "response":"\n\nSon, the British sitcom *Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?* stands out for its perfect blend of comedy and melancholy, a rare balance that sets it apart from other shows. The series, co-authored by Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement, combines sharp wit, slapstick humor, and farce with deep undertones of wistfulness, nostalgia, and regret. This emotional complexity is evident in the characters of Bob and Terry, whose tendency to reminisce and struggle with civilian life after military service adds a poignant layer to the show. The late Rodney Bewes’s expressive face further amplifies the melancholic undertones, making the series a timeless gem in British television history.\n\nThe show’s themes of nostalgia and regret are not just confined to its dialogue and character development but are also reflected in its iconic theme music. Co-authored by Ian La Frenais and Mike Hugg of Manfred Mann, the theme is a masterful blend of catchy melody and emotional depth. Despite its brilliance, the theme never achieved chart success, barely scraping into the Top 40. However, its impact on viewers was undeniable, embedding itself in the collective memory of those who watched the show. The appointment of a fake band, Highly Likely, to promote the theme further highlights the creative efforts behind its production, even if it didn’t yield commercial success.\n\nThe flow of the series is marked by its nuanced storytelling and character dynamics, which bravely tackle themes of adulthood, camaraderie, and the passage of time. Unlike other popular sitcoms like *Dad’s Army* or *Porridge*, *Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?* is not frequently repeated on terrestrial TV, reportedly due to James Bolam’s insistence. This rarity has only added to its cult status, making it a cherished memory for those who witnessed its initial run. The show’s ability to evoke both laughter and introspection has cemented its place as a brave and original contribution to British comedy.\n\nIn summary, *Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?* is a list of contradictions—funny yet melancholic, lighthearted yet profound. Its beginning marked a new era in sitcom writing, blending humor with heartfelt storytelling. The show’s appointment of La Frenais and Hugg to create its theme was a stroke of genius, even if the song itself never became a hit. The flow of its narratives, coupled with the brave portrayal of its characters’ struggles, makes it a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences. Its legacy is a testament to the power of balancing comedy and melancholy in storytelling.",

I can use 'brave' here to describe the show's unique approach. \n\nFinally, the last paragraph will tie everything together, listing the elements that made the show memorable. Use 'flow' to describe how the show's elements worked together and 'list' when summarizing the key features. \n\nI have to ensure each paragraph is concise, hits all the points, and flows naturally without forcing the keywords. I'll start drafting each section, making sure to adhere to the structure and include the required words seamlessly.\n",

Egan, however, would be keen to see the strongest England side possible travel to Ireland to play in Dublin.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, I need to help the user summarize this news article. They provided a detailed query with specific instructions. Let me read through it carefully.\n\nFirst, the user shared the beginning of a Guardian article about a new Six Nations rugby league tournament. England is set to play Ireland in Dublin, and the tournament is provisional. The chairman, Richard Egan, has concerns about fixture confirmations, which affects their planning and ticket sales. He wants the strongest England team, not a B team. There's a clash with England's series against New Zealand, so maybe the Knights will play instead. The user wants a summary in 3 paragraphs with a specific bullet point, using certain keywords.\n\nI need to structure the response correctly. They specified using markdown, so I'll include the dividers. The bullet points are markdown as well. I have to make sure each paragraph addresses different parts of the article and includes the keywords 'leader', 'produce', 'revolution', 'state', 'young'.\n\nThinking about the first paragraph, I can introduce Egan as the leader highlighting the challenges. Maybe mention the provisional fixtures and the need for stability to produce growth. \n\nIn the second paragraph, the scheduling conflict is key. The idea that the Knights might take over to allow the main team to play New Zealand is a point. This could appeal to young players, fitting the keyword.\n\nThe third paragraph should discuss the implications. The state of rugby league, the potential revolution from the tournament, and Egan's push for strong teams. Also, his concern about the B team not being suitable.\n\nI also have to add a bullet point near the end. It should be concise, using one of the keywords. Maybe focus on the importance of clear scheduling for success, using 'state' as a keyword.\n\nI need to make sure the response ends with the exact phrase they provided and add the P.P.S. Remember, no markdown in the thinking process, just natural English. \n\nI should check each keyword is used: 'leader' for Egan, 'produce' something, 'revolution' in the context of change, 'state' of the sport, and 'young' talent.\n\nWait, the summary needs to have exactly one bullet point, so I'll make sure to place it correctly after the second paragraph. Also, the bullet point should capture a main point, perhaps the scheduling conflict and its solution.\n\nLet me piece it together, making each paragraph concise, hitting the keywords, and ensuring the flow is logical. Finally, end with the required phrase and P.P.S.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user has given me a query where I need to summarize the beginning of a Guardian news article. They also specified to include certain keywords: 'calendar', 'news', 'tell', 'western', and 'window'. First, I should make sure I understand the content of the provided excerpt. It's about the legacy of New Labour, specifically Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, and how the initial optimism of 1997 didn't lead to the expected modern, fair Britain. Instead, the article reflects on how the establishment co-opted those progressive ideas but didn't deliver real change. \n\nNow, the instructions say to include the keywords. I need to find natural places to fit them in. 'Calendar' could refer to marking the timeline of events or passage of time. 'News' is straightforward since it's a news article. 'Tell' might be part of a phrase like \"tell a different story.\" 'Western' can be used in the context of a Western ideology or context. 'Window' could be metaphorical, like a window into the past or present situation.\n\nI should first repeat the request exactly as given, then craft a concise summary that includes all five keywords without forcing them. I'll also make sure that the summary captures the main points: the New Labour's unfulfilled promise, the cultural symbols of 1997, and the current disappointment and ongoing issues like racism and referendums.\n\nWait, in the provided response example, 'calendar' was used as \"a calendar of cultural milestones\" which is a good approach. For 'western', it was part of \"western progressive ideals,\" which fits. 'Window' was used as \"a window into a broader cultural shift.\" That's clever. 'News' is part of \"news article,\" and 'tell' in \"the news today tells a different story.\" \n\nI need to ensure my summary is similarly structured, hits all the keywords naturally, and accurately reflects the article's sentiment. Let me make sure I highlight how New Labour's promises failed and how the establishment absorbed the movements, leading to continued issues. That should align with the user's requirements.\n",

Most of season one’s more memorable characters return, including Dave Franco’s scam artist Jeff, and Kyle and Andi (Michael Chernus and Elizabeth Reaser), who are considering an open marriage. Available from 1 December, Netflix The Robot Will See You Now A whole week of bot-related programming from Channel 4 that explores sex-bots, driver-bots and, in the case of this documentary, empathy-bots. A glimpse of what’s looking like a weird future. 28 November, 10pm, Channel 4 Dark “Yesterday, today and tomorrow are not consecutive.” This enigmatic statement is a clue to where Netflix’s first German original is going. Shades of French mystery Les Revenants as the disappearance of two children gives rise to all manner of temporal bewilderment. Available from 1 December, Netflix Joe Orton Laid Bare The 1967 murder of the playwright Orton – by his partner Kenneth Halliwell – robbed us of a thrilling, flourishing literary talent. Fifty years on, this documentary looks back on Orton’s sadly brief career and airs an unpublished “pornographic” playlet for the first time. 25 November, 9pm, BBC Two The X Factor The singing contest-cum-Syco marketing campaign continues. Rak-Su remain favourites but Kevin Davy White will want a say, too.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

It looks like each paragraph is a different news piece about various TV shows and their release dates or air times.\n\nFirst, there's the anthology series set in Chicago with returning characters and available on Netflix. Next is a Channel 4 program about robots, including documentaries on different types of bots. Then, Netflix's first German series, which is a mystery involving missing children and time elements. After that, a documentary about Joe Orton on BBC Two, airing an unpublished play. Lastly, The X Factor continues with specific contestants mentioned.\n\nI should condense each of these into a concise summary. Make sure to highlight the key points: the shows, their genres, what they're about, and when they're available. It's important to keep it clear and straightforward so the user gets all the main info without extra details.\n\nI'll structure each part as a brief sentence, maybe in a numbered list for clarity, but since the user didn't specify, a paragraph might be better. Keep each show's info separate but flowing smoothly.\n\nNow, putting it all together. Also, I need to end with the exact phrase and add the P.P.S at the end.

They've given me a news article snippet about Jim Kweskin and the Jug Band, and they want a summary based on the beginning sentences.

Plus, they want two different responses separated by six asterisks.\n\nFirst, I'll need to understand the main points of the article. It talks about Jim Kweskin's past fame, his new album recorded in London, his guitar style, the artists backing him, and some notable tracks, including a couple they didn't like much. \n\nNow, the challenge is incorporating the keywords without making it forced. 'Chest' could relate to a صدرب but maybe not directly. 'Following' can fit naturally as in 'following the release' or 'following his legacy'. 'House' could be in the context of a venue or just 'household names'. 'Library' might be a stretch, but perhaps referring to a collection or legacy. 'Oven' is tricky; maybe metaphorically as in something warm or cooking up a project.\n\nI need to make sure each summary is unique. Maybe in the first response, focus on his guitar skills and legacy, using 'chest' as chest of songs. For the second, emphasize the blending of genres and use 'house' more as in venues or home. \n\nI also need to make sure each summary is concise and captures all the important points from the article while smoothly integrating the keywords. Let me draft two versions and check that all keywords are included and the summaries make sense in context.\n",

Hans Bunting, the chief operating officer of renewables at Innogy SE, part of the company that owns the UK energy supplier npower, said offshore windfarms had become mainstream and were destined to become even cheaper because of new, bigger turbines. Asked whether nuclear groups that want to build new reactors in the UK could compete with windfarms on cost, even when their intermittency was taken into account, Bunting replied: “Obviously they can’t.” His comments came after MPs criticised the £30bn cost to consumers for EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and said ministers should revisit the case for new nuclear before proceeding with more projects. Innogy recently secured a subsidy of £74.75 per megawatt hour of power to build a windfarm off the Lincolnshire coast, which is £17.75 cheaper than Hinkley and should be completed about three years earlier. “What we see now [with prices] is with today’s technology. It’s not about tomorrow’s technology, which is about [to come in] 2025, 2027, when Hinkley will most likely come to the grid ... and then it [windfarms] will be even cheaper.” While the company is planning to use the most powerful turbines in the world today for the Lincolnshire windfarm, Bunting said even bigger ones in development would drive costs down further. “A few years ago everyone thought 10MW [turbines] was the maximum, now we’re talking about 15[MW]. It seems the sky is the limit,” he said. “[It] means less turbines for the same capacity, less steel in the ground, less cables, even bigger rotors catching more wind, so it will become cheaper.” However, EDF argued that nuclear was also on a path to lower costs. “Early offshore wind projects started at around £150 per MW\/h and developers have shown they can offer lower prices by repeating projects with an established supply chain – the same is true for nuclear,” an EDF spokesman said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

I must avoid those specific keywords, so I'll ensure none of them appear in the summary.\n\nI'll start by outlining the main points: the cost competitiveness of windfarms, the role of new turbine technology, the comparison in subsidies, Bunting's statements on future cost reductions, and EDF's counterpoint on nuclear's cost trajectory. Then, I'll translate these points into a clear, coherent summary.\n\nI should also pay attention to proper grammar and clarity to make sure the JSON output is error-free and meets the user's requirements. Once the summary is crafted, I'll format it within a JSON object, ensuring it's correctly encapsulated within triple backticks as per the user's instruction.\n\nFinally, I'll review the summary to confirm that it accurately reflects the article's content, adheres to the exclusion of specified keywords, and is properly formatted. This thorough approach ensures that the user gets a precise and well-structured response.\n",
    "filtered_answer":"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Hans Bunting, the chief operating officer of renewables at Innogy SE, asserts that new nuclear power stations in the UK can no longer compete with offshore windfarms on cost. He highlights that offshore windfarms have become mainstream and are expected to become even cheaper due to advancements in turbine technology. Bunting's comments follow criticism from MPs regarding the high cost of EDF Energy's Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, which is expected to cost consumers £30bn. Innogy recently secured a subsidy of £74.75 per megawatt hour for a windfarm off the Lincolnshire coast, which is significantly cheaper than Hinkley's subsidy and is expected to be completed three years earlier. Bunting emphasized that future turbine technology, such as 15MW turbines, will further reduce costs. However, EDF argued that nuclear energy is also on a path to lower costs, similar to how offshore wind projects have seen cost reductions over time.\"\n}\n```",
