      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n It was the frog that pushed me over the edge. I’ve never been a Harry Potter fan myself – I was already out of kids’ books when they first came out, and those clever grown-up covers weren’t enough to tempt me back – but I’d always admired JK Rowling from afar. Who wouldn’t? A writer whose imagination transfixed the world, whose riches now exceed those of the Queen, but who has founded a children’s charity, pays her taxes in full, and remains both poised and politically engaged: as role models go, it is hard to think of a better one. So I was pleased when my seven-year-old son went Harry Potter crazy. Having never read to himself before, he was suddenly racing through book after book, his bedside light on late into the night. His brother and several of his friends caught the bug – just as the Suez canal flowed through Clarissa Eden’s drawing room, Hogwarts overshadowed our house, as children constantly dashed about on broomsticks, casting spells and looking for snitches. It was impressive to see the “Harry Potter effect” in action: the magical power that, in the two decades since its first publication, has revitalised the children’s publishing industry, encouraged millions of children to read, sold more than 400m copies across the world, and generated a cultural empire worth £20bn. Less pleasant, however, was the realisation that there was a marketing juggernaut poised to capitalise on my son’s enthusiasm. Unlike those first readers 20 years ago, the children discovering Harry Potter now are immediately faced with a multibillion-pound industry trading in Potter-themed “experiences” and paraphernalia.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Hope to Nope: Politics and Graphics 2008-2018 at the Design Museum From the endless imitations of Shepard Fairey’s seminal Hope poster for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, to the inventive plethora of Donald Trump memes, this exhibition will show how graphic design’s engagement with politics has evolved over the last decade. Featuring the work of high-profile and amateur designers, in campaign billboards, T-shirts and cartoons, it will show graphic design’s power as a tool for political discussion, debate and provocation. • Opens 28 March, Design Museum, London. Windermere Jetty Museum by Carmody Groarke A cluster of copper-clad sheds nestles on the edge of Windermere in the Lake District, signalling the new home for the Jetty Museum, a fascinating little institution that has been telling the story of boats and boatsmen since the 1940s.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theresa May has declared that tackling climate change and reducing its effects on poorer countries is a “moral imperative”, as the Conservative party renewed its push to portray itself as environmentally friendly. The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron’s 2005 efforts to show the Tories cared about global warming. Ahead of this week’s climate change summit in Paris, May said: “There is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.” She described coal as “one of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power” and hailed the “enormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents”. May’s commitment to the issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real. However, the prime minister insists “tackling climate change and mitigating its effects for the world’s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces”. At the summit she will announce a £140m boost to funding for poorer communities affected by climate change through deforestation or vulnerability to natural disasters and extreme weather, plus £15m of additional support for reconstruction on Dominica in the Caribbean, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. It comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being asked by party officials to show off their green credentials after internal polling showed the level of concern among younger voters about environmental issues. The party has been alarmed by the backlash against May’s support for a free vote on foxhunting, the omission of a ban on the ivory trade from the manifesto and its lack of support for an amendment that would have recognised in UK law that animals feel pain.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Vladimir Putin has declared mission accomplished for Russian forces in the fight against Islamic State in Syria, as he made a surprise visit to the Russian airbase in the country. “Friends, the motherland is waiting for you,” Putin told the Russian air force detachment based at the Khmeimim airbase during his visit on Monday morning. “You are coming back home with victory.” Earlier this month, the head of the Russian army said Syria had been entirely liberated from Isis forces.

The prime minister made a concession on Monday by agreeing to set up a new committee of MPs to monitor any proposed legal changes as EU legislation is converted into the British statute book. She had been facing a parliamentary defeat over the issue during the debate on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday, after a widespread backbench revolt among remain- and leave-supporting MPs. However, the government has not backed down on its intention to fix the day of Brexit as 29 March 2019 or acceded to the demands of soft Brexit Tory MPs who wanted a meaningful vote on the terms of the final deal before that date. One Conservative rebel said May was in trouble over these two issues because there were enough dissatisfied Conservatives combined with Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and other opposition MPs to defeat the government. The MP said the government and the rebels were currently in a standoff with neither side prepared to back down. However, government sources were confident May had managed to convince enough of her backbenchers not to defy the whip by indicating that a vote was likely to happen well before the date of leaving and promising a second vote on legislation implementing the EU withdrawal agreement hammered out in Brussels on Friday. The appetite for rebellion among Conservative MPs will become clearer during the two days of debate and voting on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday and Wednesday. Up to 25 had threatened to revolt unless May promised more scrutiny over Brexit lawmaking, but No 10’s concessions appear to have allayed concerns among the would-be troublemakers. The government will agree to establish a new committee of MPs to help weed out the overuse of “Henry VIII powers”, which allow ministers to make changes to secondary legislation as it is transposed.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theresa May has been forced to accept more scrutiny of Brexit lawmaking to head off a Tory revolt but is still heading for a showdown over how MPs get to vote on the final deal and whether the date for leaving should be fixed in law. The prime minister made a concession on Monday by agreeing to set up a new committee of MPs to monitor any proposed legal changes as EU legislation is converted into the British statute book. She had been facing a parliamentary defeat over the issue during the debate on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday, after a widespread backbench revolt among remain- and leave-supporting MPs. However, the government has not backed down on its intention to fix the day of Brexit as 29 March 2019 or acceded to the demands of soft Brexit Tory MPs who wanted a meaningful vote on the terms of the final deal before that date. One Conservative rebel said May was in trouble over these two issues because there were enough dissatisfied Conservatives combined with Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and other opposition MPs to defeat the government. The MP said the government and the rebels were currently in a standoff with neither side prepared to back down. However, government sources were confident May had managed to convince enough of her backbenchers not to defy the whip by indicating that a vote was likely to happen well before the date of leaving and promising a second vote on legislation implementing the EU withdrawal agreement hammered out in Brussels on Friday. The appetite for rebellion among Conservative MPs will become clearer during the two days of debate and voting on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday and Wednesday. Up to 25 had threatened to revolt unless May promised more scrutiny over Brexit lawmaking, but No 10’s concessions appear to have allayed concerns among the would-be troublemakers. The government will agree to establish a new committee of MPs to help weed out the overuse of “Henry VIII powers”, which allow ministers to make changes to secondary legislation as it is transposed.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n International affairs Iran nuclear deal, 15 January We should know by mid-January how serious Donald Trump is about seeking a confrontation with Iran over its nuclear programme. The US president refused in October to continue to certify the 2015 multilateral agreement under which Tehran accepted strict curbs on its activities in return for sanctions relief. Trump said that either Congress or US allies should fix the “serious flaws” in the deal, or he would “terminate it. The Senate has since opted out of dealing with the matter, and Washington’s allies have insisted that the 2015 agreement cannot be renegotiated. If Trump refuses to sign a six-monthly presidential waiver due on 15 January, nuclear-related sanctions against Iran will no longer be suspended and the US will be in violation of agreement. The other signatories, including the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China, would then have to decide whether to try to carry on without the US or allow the agreement to collapse. Either way, the Trump administration would have taken a very significant step toward open confrontation. Winter Olympics, 9 February The Winter Olympics in South Korea will be both a festival of sport and a test of the increasingly fragile peace in the region. If the war of words between Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is defused, the Olympics could offer the opportunity for a thaw.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n International affairs Iran nuclear deal, 15 January We should know by mid-January how serious Donald Trump is about seeking a confrontation with Iran over its nuclear programme. The US president refused in October to continue to certify the 2015 multilateral agreement under which Tehran accepted strict curbs on its activities in return for sanctions relief. Trump said that either Congress or US allies should fix the “serious flaws” in the deal, or he would “terminate it. The Senate has since opted out of dealing with the matter, and Washington’s allies have insisted that the 2015 agreement cannot be renegotiated. If Trump refuses to sign a six-monthly presidential waiver due on 15 January, nuclear-related sanctions against Iran will no longer be suspended and the US will be in violation of agreement. The other signatories, including the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China, would then have to decide whether to try to carry on without the US or allow the agreement to collapse. Either way, the Trump administration would have taken a very significant step toward open confrontation. Winter Olympics, 9 February The Winter Olympics in South Korea will be both a festival of sport and a test of the increasingly fragile peace in the region. If the war of words between Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is defused, the Olympics could offer the opportunity for a thaw. Seoul has suggested a lull in joint manoeuvres with the US during the Games, potentially opening the way for dialogue.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Professional athletes are generally the highest expression of what the human body is capable of doing and therefore inspiring to the fans to reach higher and strive harder. In that way, no sport is superior to any other sport. But when it comes to professional sports, some are more inspirational, more exciting and more entertaining to the general public than others and those sports take on a symbolic meaning for Americans. They come to represent our core values.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['bag', 'edge', 'kiss', 'passenger', 'wear'] in the response.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The career of Keith Chegwin, who has died aged 60, is characterised by having presented both one of the most popular children’s TV shows in history and a contender for the medium’s most notorious adult entertainment. Viewers saw the best of him in Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (BBC1, 1976-82) and its successor, Saturday Superstore (1982-87), on which Chegwin became an honorary big brother to several generations of goggle-eyed British children, through his cheeky grin and giggle, high-pitched Liverpudlian-accented enthusiasm, and psychedelic knitwear. His presentational worst occurred when Chegwin threw off the novelty sweaters – and, indeed, all clothing except a hat – to front the naturist show Naked (Channel 5, 2000), described by a parliamentarian at the time as the “most disgusting programme ever shown” on British TV. But, while he should be remembered for the work he did with his jolly jumpers on, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for Chegwin, even in his most desperate televisual enterprises. This was due to a natural likability. Only the most sympathetic TV presenters earn nicknames from viewers, and, just as Bruce Forsyth transmuted into “Brucie”, Chegwin rapidly and indelibly became “Cheggers”. That identity was cemented by the title of the third huge success of his children’s career: the music-based gameshow, Cheggers Plays Pop (BBC1, 1978-86), which extended his presenting empire to weekdays. In less prosperous times, though, audiences also admired the impressive and affecting determination with which Cheggers, in the three decades after his Saturday morning career ended, tried to reinvent himself, often against considerable odds. In addition to a common problem for children’s presenters – becoming too old to maintain the required fantasy-sibling dynamic – Chegwin suffered health problems, including alcoholism. Apart from the established presenter-rehab route of reality TV – appearing on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity MasterChef – Chegwin also offered ironic spins on his showbiz rise and fall in 10 projects, including Ricky Gervais’s Extras and Life’s Too Short, and Kill Keith (2011), an improbable comedy-horror Brit film spoof of Tarantino’s Kill Bill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

She got a tattoo from a quote in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" for her birthday after a romantic disappointment. This tattoo represents her as someone who, despite her small stature, is fierce. Hayley is described as direct, talkative, and humorous, with a wardrobe focused on actors and characters.

Four fire engines were called to a street in Walkden, Greater Manchester, after the fire broke out at the house at about 5am on Monday. A 14-year-old girl was declared dead at the scene and an eight-year-old boy and seven-year-old girl died in hospital. A three-year-old girl was said to be in a critical condition on Monday afternoon, while a woman, 35, who is understood to be the children’s mother, was in a serious condition. Police are yet to formally identify the victims, but the mother and her 14-year-old daughter have been named locally as Michelle Pearson, 35, and Demi Pearson. Drew Povey, the headteacher at Harrop Fold school in Little Hulton, where Demi was a pupil, said: “We are devastated at the tragic loss of life today in our community. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family involved.” Greater Manchester police said they had arrested three men, aged 23, 20 and 18, and a 20-year-old woman on Monday on suspicion of murder. A 24-year-old man is also being questioned in custody on suspicion of assisting an offender. Police had previously urged a murder suspect to hand himself in, saying there was “an active manhunt” to find an individual who they did not name. “All I would say is he knows who he is and he should give himself up immediately,” said Ch Supt Wayne Miller.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is to launch plans for an opt-out system of organ donation, asking people to overcome their “fatal reluctance” to discuss the issue with family and friends. Under the plans, everybody in England would be presumed to be happy to donate their organs on their death, unless they have signed up to a register stating that they do not want that to happen. In practice, however, it is unlikely that organs would be taken against the wishes of the family. The government’s ambition to change the NHS organ donation programme was announced by Theresa May in her Conservative party conference speech in October. Last year, she said, “500 people died because a suitable organ was not available.

We want as many people as possible to have their say as we shape the new opt-out process,” said Hunt. “As well as changing the law, we also need to change the conversation – it can be a difficult subject to broach, but overcoming this fatal reluctance to talk openly about our wishes is key to saving many more lives in the future.” The consultation will ask three questions: how much say should families have in their deceased relative’s decision to donate their organs?

Under the plans, everybody in England would be presumed to be happy to donate their organs on their death, unless they have signed up to a register stating that they do not want that to happen. In practice, however, it is unlikely that organs would be taken against the wishes of the family. The government’s ambition to change the NHS organ donation programme was announced by Theresa May in her Conservative party conference speech in October. Last year, she said, “500 people died because a suitable organ was not available. And there are 6,500 on the transplant list today.” NHS Blood and Transplant’s figures show that 1,100 families in the UK decided not to allow organ donation because they were unsure, or did not know whether their relatives would have wanted to donate an organ or not. “Every day, three people die for want of a transplant, which is why our historic plans to transform the way organ donation works are so important.

Hence, a strategic increase in the number of digital jobs is one of the quickest methods to boost wages for the British populace.\n\nFrom a historical standpoint, Britain has been pivotal in the scientific revolution, so there is a substantial foundation to build upon in embracing the digital future. Is there anything else I can help with? \n\nP.P.S: Considering the historical significance of scientific innovation in Britain, there's ample opportunity to leverage this legacy in the digital age to foster economic growth and improve living standards.",

Expect powdery white palm-fringed sands, clear warm waters and excellent diving. Spend a week at the Vinpearl Phu Quoc Resort, perched on the edge of Bai Dai Beach, with idyllic views of the Gulf of Thailand from almost every angle. • £859pp all-inclusive at Vinpearl Phu Quoc Resort, including return flights, with Tui Best for peace and quiet: Cyprus The island of Cyprus has one of the mildest winters in the Med and – if you stay away from the big resorts which seem a bit forlorn in low season – there is much to offer independent travellers, from Byzantine churches to ancient mountain villages. In the hamlet of Psematismenos, Modus Vivendi’s one-bed apartments make a good low-key base: a collection of six stone cottages set around a small pool and flower-filled terrace. Interiors are rustic with stone-flagged floors and beamed ceilings. The coast is 3km away and the bright lights of Larnaca, Limassol and Nicosia within a 30-minute drive. • From £80 a night at Modus Vivendi though i-escape. Flights to Larnaca cost from £69 return with easyJet Best for value: Sri Lanka If the slick five-star resorts of the Seychelles and Maldives are beyond your budget, consider Sri Lanka – same white-sand beaches and clear Indian Ocean waters, but for a fraction of the price.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

But for those of us who don’t have the luxury of taking a gap year, tour operator Tui has just launched the first direct flights from the UK this winter, bringing this remote island within an 11.5 hour flight on the 787 Dreamliner. Expect powdery white palm-fringed sands, clear warm waters and excellent diving. Spend a week at the Vinpearl Phu Quoc Resort, perched on the edge of Bai Dai Beach, with idyllic views of the Gulf of Thailand from almost every angle. • £859pp all-inclusive at Vinpearl Phu Quoc Resort, including return flights, with Tui Best for peace and quiet: Cyprus The island of Cyprus has one of the mildest winters in the Med and – if you stay away from the big resorts which seem a bit forlorn in low season – there is much to offer independent travellers, from Byzantine churches to ancient mountain villages. In the hamlet of Psematismenos, Modus Vivendi’s one-bed apartments make a good low-key base: a collection of six stone cottages set around a small pool and flower-filled terrace. Interiors are rustic with stone-flagged floors and beamed ceilings. The coast is 3km away and the bright lights of Larnaca, Limassol and Nicosia within a 30-minute drive. • From £80 a night at Modus Vivendi though i-escape. Flights to Larnaca cost from £69 return with easyJet Best for value: Sri Lanka If the slick five-star resorts of the Seychelles and Maldives are beyond your budget, consider Sri Lanka – same white-sand beaches and clear Indian Ocean waters, but for a fraction of the price.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n When Carla Bruni, the Italian-born, French-raised heiress and supermodel quit the catwalk to reinvent herself as a singer-songwriter 20 years ago, many thought it would be short-lived dilettantism. Yet Bruni surprised her detractors, showing herself to be a talented songwriter and a careful, nuanced singer whose jazzy chansons soon topped the French charts. She has continued to do so, even after the inevitable hiatus to her musical career caused by marrying Nicolas Sarkozy, and spending 2008-12 in the Élysée as France’s first lady. She has spoken of suffering from crippling stage fright, but this still-gamine figure, fronting a four-piece, light-jazz band, exudes preternatural poise. Bruni moves with beatific grace, recalling Karl Lagerfeld’s praise of her as “this beautiful creature who can wear anything”; her husky whisper could be a parody of a breathy Gallic siren. Her latest album is a set of cover versions sung in English, French Touch, which is a decidedly mixed bag. It largely works because Bruni pours herself into the songs as if in thrall to them: her pitch-perfect, sparse croon through Depeche Mode’s Enjoy the Silence identifies and amplifies the bleak yearning at the song’s core. The quirky arrangements can be eccentric. Bruni’s cod-jazz take on Willie Nelson’s Crazy veers near to lift muzak, while the jaunty noodling her band introduce to Lou Reed’s Perfect Day sounds at odds with the song’s dark soul. The Clash’s Jimmy Jazz is transformed into a previously unknown genre that can only be described as ethereal boogie-woogie.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

However, the film looks set to face strong opposition from Steven Spielberg’s Pentagon Papers drama The Post and Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, at a Globes ceremony that will provide the entertainment industry with its first major opportunity to respond to the sexual abuse scandal plaguing Hollywood. Two months after the emergence of allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein that would prompt a further torrent of claims against men in the film industry, the nominations exhibited an already changed landscape in Hollywood. As expected none of the Weinstein-produced films eligible for inclusion received nominations, however there were multiple nominations for Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World, which was forced to replace star Kevin Spacey at short notice, after he was accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and harassment. At the same time, the widely predicted shift towards a more female-focused list of nominees in the wake of the Weinstein scandal did not materialise. Though there were nods for a number of films with female protagonists, including The Shape of Water, Three Billboards, I, Tonya, a biopic of disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding and coming-of-age comedy-drama Lady Bird, there was no room in the nominees for any female directors, while Patty Jenkins’s feminist superhero movie Wonder Woman was snubbed entirely. Leading the way with seven nominations is the Shape of Water, which stars British actor Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaner at a governmental research facility who falls in love with a captured sea creature. Both Del Toro and Hawkins have been nominated in the drama category, for best director and best actress respectively, while Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer have received supporting actor and actress nominations. The film has also received best screenplay and score nominations, as well as best picture in the drama category.

    "response":"SECTION 1\nWithin an art classroom in Denver, Colorado, a revealing lesson illustrates one of the fundamental aspects of creativity. The teacher challenges her students by instructing them to reproduce the style of the renowned artist, Vassily Kandinsky. Their efforts focus on replicating his geometric abstractions, learning various brush techniques, and the intricate use of colors, all of which contribute to a foundational understanding of art history. However, the teacher’s goal isn't merely to confine the students to historical imitation; she pushes their creative boundaries by encouraging them to dissect and reassemble their two-dimensional creations into three-dimensional sculptures. It's important to note that each student begins with the same starting point—a piece of work inspired by Kandinsky. Yet, their final outcomes are incredibly diverse, ranging from columns that shoot upwards starkly to sculptures that occupy space through a complex play of angles and forms.\n\nThis innovative teaching method exemplifies how creativity is not a solitary endeavor but a collaborative process built upon existing foundations. It challenges the notion that original ideas spring forth spontaneously and instead emphasizes the role of both derivation and extrapolation. The teacher nurtures an environment where ideas can evolve, build upon, and transform past knowledge, regardless of the starting point. Each student’s sculpture acts as a symbol of the continual evolution and reimagining of existing artistic practices. The ultimate lesson is that creativity thrives when it builds upon what has been known and does not remain confined but rather explores and extends beyond its initial boundaries, linked by a continuous thread of innovation and inspiration.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In her essays, Susan Sontag spoke with one of the great, sure voices of the last century. From her salon at the centre of the cosmopolis, marvellously at one with her books and her learning, she considered, renamed and renewed our relationship with camp, with photography, with illness: a living legend of braininess and cool. Sontag, was not, though, as her editor Benjamin Taylor admits in the introduction to this gathering of stories from across her career, a committed short-story writer. She turned to the form in order to evade what Chekhov called “autobiographophobia”, which Taylor uses to mean the fear of writing and reflecting directly about one’s life. Evading this fear, Sontag clearly found the name “stories” very helpful: half of them are pure autobiography. “Pilgrimage”, for example, which opens the volume, is a memoir of Sontag’s youth in southern California, and an account of her visit with a boyfriend to the home of an ageing Thomas Mann. The only reason why this did not become an essay, it seems, is that the encounter was dull and disappointing, and so difficult to reflect on: Mann had “only sententious formulas to deliver. And I uttered nothing but tongue-tied simplicities, though I was full of complex feeling. We were neither of us at our best.” The next piece, “Project for a Trip to China”, is also memoir: we learn more about Sontag’s childhood (she was a voracious reader and dug deep holes in the garden to sit in); about her habit of ordering ambitiously in restaurants (hundred-year-old eggs); and a little about her father, who worked in China. The piece is more experimental, using lists and tables, characters identified by initials only, and lots of negatives (she does not, predictably, go to China).\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In her essays, Susan Sontag spoke with one of the great, sure voices of the last century. From her salon at the centre of the cosmopolis, marvellously at one with her books and her learning, she considered, renamed and renewed our relationship with camp, with photography, with illness: a living legend of braininess and cool. Sontag, was not, though, as her editor Benjamin Taylor admits in the introduction to this gathering of stories from across her career, a committed short-story writer. She turned to the form in order to evade what Chekhov called “autobiographophobia”, which Taylor uses to mean the fear of writing and reflecting directly about one’s life. Evading this fear, Sontag clearly found the name “stories” very helpful: half of them are pure autobiography. “Pilgrimage”, for example, which opens the volume, is a memoir of Sontag’s youth in southern California, and an account of her visit with a boyfriend to the home of an ageing Thomas Mann. The only reason why this did not become an essay, it seems, is that the encounter was dull and disappointing, and so difficult to reflect on: Mann had “only sententious formulas to deliver. And I uttered nothing but tongue-tied simplicities, though I was full of complex feeling. We were neither of us at our best.” The next piece, “Project for a Trip to China”, is also memoir: we learn more about Sontag’s childhood (she was a voracious reader and dug deep holes in the garden to sit in); about her habit of ordering ambitiously in restaurants (hundred-year-old eggs); and a little about her father, who worked in China. The piece is more experimental, using lists and tables, characters identified by initials only, and lots of negatives (she does not, predictably, go to China).\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Answer with at least 181 words. Your response should contain at least 14 sentences. Your answer must contain exactly 2 bullet points. Use the markdown bullet points such as:\n* This is point 1. \n* This is point 2 Do not include keywords ['pool', 'sir', 'site', 'tip', 'weakness'] in the response.",
    "response":"* Susan Sontag was a significant and profound influence in the literary world, known for her distinct and powerful voice. She explored and reinterpreted various facets of life, including camp, photography, and her personal experiences with illness, which earned her the status of a beacon of intelligence and elegance.\n* These insights are compiled in a collection of short stories that demonstrate Sontag's adeptness at evading the fear of writing personal life accounts, as she feared this direct approach to her narrative. One of her works, \"Pilgrimage\", is an autobiographical sketch of her childhood in Southern California and a visit to Thomas Mann's house, where the meeting disappointed both participants. \n\nSusan Sontag's writings also include an account of her youthful penchant for delving into extensive holes in her garden for seclusion and her habit of ordering sophisticated dishes, such as hundred-year-old eggs. The second piece, \"Project for a Trip to China\", employs a more experimental format with the use of lists, characters identified with initials, and negative definitives. This approach emphasizes the idea that her experiences in China did not materialize as planned, thereby reflecting on the unpredictability of life and the varied outcomes of her aspirations.\n\nThe collection of these stories not only provides a fascinating insight into Sontag's personal life but also highlights her ability to navigate through complex emotions and situations with grace and depth. Her adeptness in circumventing direct self-revelation and transforming personal experiences into compelling narratives is indeed a testament to her extraordinary talent and her unique perspective on the world. Sontag's collection of short stories is a collection of reflections and insights into her life and the world around her, showcasing her intellectual breadth and emotional sensitivity.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n To non-vegans, the idea of a plant-based Christmas dinner may smack of Scrooge crouched over a miserly candle, sucking on a single slice of tofu. There are few holidays more dedicated to tearing up the five-a-day-guidelines than this one, so if you take away not only the meat but the cream, then what’s left? Actually, this year there’s a lot left, as supermarkets are increasingly wise to the idea that plenty of vegans want to stuff their faces, too. With estimates that between 2 and 12% of British people now follow a vegetarian diet, it’s unsurprising that a vegetarian Christmas is well catered for by shops, but the rise of the “flexitarian” means that even non-vegans may buy and try vegan now, if it’s an option. It takes a bit of supermarket-hopping and a familiarity with an online checkout to do it, but with a little effort, there’s now a gluttonous array of choice. Christmas dinner is a roast with bits added on, and the majority of a roast is vegan anyway. There are a few tweaks that may need to be made – use oil to roast the potatoes instead of fat; swap butter for olive oil in the mash, and leave honey off the parsnips and carrots (you could swap in maple or agave syrup for sweetness). When it comes to the star of the show, the amount of effort you’re willing to put in will dictate your centrepiece. The ever-reliable Linda McCartney range’s new “roast beef” joint comes with a boozy-tasting red wine glaze and a remarkably beef-like flavour, which is great for vegans who like the taste of meat but not the methods, though it may be too meaty for some. Fry’s soy and quinoa Country Roast is a solid herby veggie roast, while Tofurky’s turkey and stuffing is a respectable substitute for the real thing.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Mr Richards had been having a thin time of it but three hurdles wins in the past 10 days, from just a handful of runners, have sent him to the top of our table. By contrast, Harry Fry, who had been soaring, has dropped a long way, Overtown Express having been his only success in the past fortnight, admittedly from just 13 runners; he will surely be back among the winners soon. The Henderson, Tizzard and Skelton camps continue in fine form, while Donald McCain is having his best run for years. But the powerful yards of Hobbs and Mulholland seem disappointingly quiet. Venetia Williams has not yet hit her stride, despite a couple of false dawns, but January is often a fruitful time for her.

The percentage figure is their win strike-rate for the last fortnight, while their total number of runners in that time is shown in brackets. It’s a good time to be called Nicky. Mr Richards had been having a thin time of it but three hurdles wins in the past 10 days, from just a handful of runners, have sent him to the top of our table. By contrast, Harry Fry, who had been soaring, has dropped a long way, Overtown Express having been his only success in the past fortnight, admittedly from just 13 runners; he will surely be back among the winners soon. The Henderson, Tizzard and Skelton camps continue in fine form, while Donald McCain is having his best run for years. But the powerful yards of Hobbs and Mulholland seem disappointingly quiet. Venetia Williams has not yet hit her stride, despite a couple of false dawns, but January is often a fruitful time for her. Today’s tips have been provided by John O’Hara, whose nap has, alas, become a non-runner. In that one’s absence, Archie Stevens (3.30) could be the pick of the Southwell card at odds of 7-2.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The rather unexpected allusion by the prime minister this week in a speech to the Business Council of Australia to the government’s pursuit of further income tax cuts is not one that should be treated with too much respect until he also talks about how to pay for them. With the return to surplus built on income tax revenue, any income tax cuts are unlikely to come before the next decade without either increases in other taxes or big cuts to government services. Amid the usual “free markets are great” rah-rah that the prime minister doled out to the Business Council of Australia on Monday night, Malcolm Turnbull also slipped in a line on income tax cuts, noting that he was: “Actively working with the treasurer and all my cabinet colleagues to ease the burden on middle-income Australians, while also meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” This was a bit of a surprise given the current state of the budget is such that the government is projecting that a return to surplus only in 2020-21and that net debt at that point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP. Even in the best of times, promising income tax cuts as the budget is in deficit is a courageous position to take for a political party that likes to prides itself on “budget responsibility”.It is even more courageous when the path back to surplus is built on a foundation of income tax revenue. Individual’s income tax has always been the biggest tax in the budget. During the mining-boom years it declined slightly in importance as company tax exploded in value from 3.3% of GDP in 1998-99 to5.3% of GDP in 2005-06. But in the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for just over half of all tax revenue. Now that in itself is a bit of a problem (the IMF and OECD have made calls for Australia to lessen its reliance on income tax) but it is a bigger problem for Turnbull and his call for tax cuts while also “meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” The issue it that of the extra $88.1bn in tax revenue the government hopes to gain between now and 2020-21, $48.5bn of it is to come from individual income tax. This means that income tax is actually bearing a greater burden of the increase in tax than would be expected. Income tax makes up 50.6% of total tax revenue, but accounts for 55% of the increase in tax revenue between now and 2020-21.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The heavy reliance on income tax, which comprises over half of all tax revenue, poses challenges as it already bears a disproportionate share of the anticipated tax increases.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Olivia Mead, a millionaire heiress whose list of expenses included a $1.2m crystal-encrusted grand piano and $2,000 annual upkeep of her pet axolotl, has had her inheritance cut from $25m to $6.14m following an appeal from her deceased father’s estate. The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father’s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have “any involvement or association whatsoever” with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than “traditional” Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead’s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court’s master, Craig Sanderson, said would “not fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community”. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright’s estate, acting on behalf of Wright’s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later. On Wednesday, the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court set aside Sanderson’s orders, ruling that while Sanderson was correct to say that Mead had been inadequately provided for in the original will: “The exercise of his discretion to order that provision be made for the respondent in the sum of $25m was flawed.” In a lengthy written judgment, the court found that Sanderson made a number of “material errors” in calculating the size of Mead’s inheritance, saying the focus should have been on what constituted “proper maintenance” and that the initial finding that Mead was “honest” and “not a gold-digger” were not relevant. “The capital sum should be sufficient to enable the respondent to purchase a reasonably substantial house with part of the capital sum and to invest the balance so that she will receive a reasonably substantial annuity for the remainder of her life,” the appeal court’s president, Michael Buss, said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The former top official for internet censorship in China, who travelled to the heart of Silicon Valley to promote China’s vision for the web, is under investigation for corruption, the Communist party’s anti-corruption agency has said. Lu Wei was the powerful and flamboyant head of the Cyberspace Administration of China from 2014 until June 2016 and he came to personify China’s model for internet control. He travelled to the United States, meeting with the CEOs of Facebook, Amazon and Apple, and held court when tech titans visited China. Lu was being investigated for “serious disciplinary violations”, a euphemism for graft, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said on its website. He stepped down from running the Cyberspace Administration in 2016, leading to rumours he had fallen out of favour. President Xi Jinping has led a far reaching anti-corruption drive since coming to power five years ago and has said graft is the paramount threat to the ruling Communist party. The campaign has seen nearly 1.4m party members punished and Xi vowed to continue rooting out graft during his second five-year term which began last month. Critics say elements of the anti-graft campaign have been used to eliminate Xi’s enemies and root out political factions that oppose him. Lu is the most prominent official to fall since Xi’s second term began and the anti-corruption agency pointed to Lu’s case as a sign the drive will continue. “Lu Wei being investigated by the organisation is the best proof of this determination and resolve,” the agency said in a commentary.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Lu Wei was the powerful and flamboyant head of the Cyberspace Administration of China from 2014 until June 2016 and he came to personify China’s model for internet control. He travelled to the United States, meeting with the CEOs of Facebook, Amazon and Apple, and held court when tech titans visited China. Lu was being investigated for “serious disciplinary violations”, a euphemism for graft, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said on its website. He stepped down from running the Cyberspace Administration in 2016, leading to rumours he had fallen out of favour. President Xi Jinping has led a far reaching anti-corruption drive since coming to power five years ago and has said graft is the paramount threat to the ruling Communist party. The campaign has seen nearly 1.4m party members punished and Xi vowed to continue rooting out graft during his second five-year term which began last month. Critics say elements of the anti-graft campaign have been used to eliminate Xi’s enemies and root out political factions that oppose him. Lu is the most prominent official to fall since Xi’s second term began and the anti-corruption agency pointed to Lu’s case as a sign the drive will continue. “Lu Wei being investigated by the organisation is the best proof of this determination and resolve,” the agency said in a commentary.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n As the Queensland election campaign heads into its final stretch, Labor’s main message of “chaos” under a Liberal National party-One Nation government has been damaged by one of its own, while Adani continues to cause headaches for both major parties. With Queenslanders preparing to head to the polls on Saturday, no clear victor has emerged, leaving both the LNP and Labor scrambling to bed down seats. Labor has consolidated its message to one line – “a clear choice” – as it seeks to highlight what it says will be the “cuts and chaos” under a Tim Nicholls-led government. The LNP leader has said he is willing to work with One Nation in the event of a hung parliament. But the Labor campaign is reeling from the damage done by one of its own MPs, the former police minister Jo-Ann Miller, who sought out the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, in front of the media on Tuesday, embracing her and presenting her with a gift for her new grandson. Media at the event have reported that One Nation was aware of Miller’s intentions. Miller and Labor have maintained it was a coincidence of the campaign and a “common decency” to present a gift for a new baby. But the friendly meeting may have damaged Labor’s attempts to paint itself as standing apart from Hanson’s party, which is predicted to take seats across north and central Queensland, as well as some outer-urban electorates in the south-east. “The real issue here is what is going to happen in three days’ time, on Saturday,” Annastacia Palaszczuk said from Bundaberg on Wednesday, moments before her team attempted to keep her away from signs declaring: “It’ll be grim under Tim.” The placement of “grim” seemed a little too close for comfort for those focused on optics. “That is the real fundamental issue and it is about a choice, it is fundamentally about a clear choice,” she said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

At a gala dinner in Canberra on Tuesday, Rinehart gave the inaugural agricultural and related industries award to Joyce, describing him as a “champion of the industry”. Labor immediately took aim at the award, with the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, labelling it a “$40,000 cash present”. Joyce has said he will refuse the cash. The Nationals leader, a close personal friend of Rinehart and former agriculture and water minister, is currently battling for his political life in the New England byelection after the high court ruled him ineligible to sit in parliament because of dual New Zealand citizenship. Rinehart thanked Joyce for taking “time out of your campaigning schedule to come here – to be here for the industry you love and support”. “What a great voice for Australian agriculture,” she said. “The agricultural industry is fortunate to have had such a dedicated, understanding and enthusiastic minister – one with years of first-hand experience – a real Aussie country boy and boy, do we hope you return.” Footage of the event shows Joyce stood up to accept the award and giant cheque, before modestly exclaiming “hooley dooley – rightio”. In addition to being the chair of Hancock Prospecting, Rinehart has extensive agricultural holdings and is the part owner of the $386m S Kidman and Co cattle company which has leasehold over 80,000 sq km in Australia’s north.
