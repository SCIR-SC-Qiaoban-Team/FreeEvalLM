Diamond is a wide-bandgap semiconductor that is rendered electronically active by incorporating a hole dopant, boron. While the effects of boron doping on the electronic band structure of diamond are well-studied, any link between charge carriers and plasmons, which could facilitate optical applications, has never been shown. Here, we report intervalence plasmons in boron-doped diamond, defined as collective electronic excitations between the valence subbands, opened up by the presence of holes. Evidence for these low energy excitations is provided by scanning transmission electron microscope-valence electron energy loss spectroscopy and photoinduced force infrared spectroscopy. The measured loss and absorbance spectra are subsequently reproduced by first-principles calculations based on the contribution of intervalence band transitions to the dielectric function. Remarkably, the calculations also reveal that the real part of the dielectric function exhibits a resonance characteristic of metallicity (narrow-banded negative values of the dielectric function). The energy of the zero-crossing and the position of the loss peak are found to coincide, and both increase with the carrier density. Our results provide insight into a new mechanism for inducing plasmon-like behavior in doped semiconductors from intervalence band transitions, and the possibility of attaining such properties in diamond, a key emerging material for biomedical and quantum information technologies. <|end_of_solution|>",

It is shown that the proposed guidance law exhibits k-exponential stability when converging to the desired path consisting of straight and curved lines.

Methods that find correspondences and solve for the fundamental matrix offer high precision in most cases. Conversely, methods predicting pose directly using neural networks are more robust to limited overlap and can infer absolute translation scale, but at the expense of reduced precision. We show how to combine the best of both methods; our approach yields results that are both precise and robust, while also accurately inferring translation scales.

However, in strongly correlated fermionic systems where gapless fermions are usually present in the vicinity of QCP, the driven dynamics has rarely been explored. In this Letter, we investigate the driven critical dynamics in two-dimensional Dirac systems, which harbor semimetal and Mott insulator phases separated by the QCP triggered by the interplay between fluctuations of gapless Dirac fermions and order-parameter bosons. By studying the evolution of physical quantities for different driving rates through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we confirm that the driven dynamics is described by the FTS form. Accordingly, our results significantly generalize the KZM theory by relaxing its requirement for a gapped initial state to the system accommodating gapless Dirac fermionic excitation. Through successfully extending the KZM and FTS theory to Dirac QCP, our work not only brings new fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics, but also provides a novel theoretical approach to fathom quantum critical properties in fermionic systems.\n<|end_of_solution|>",

In the almost K\\\"ahler case, this recovers Koszul's BV-algebra, defined for any Poisson manifold. As a consequence, both the Dolbeault and that de Rham cohomologies of any compact Hermitian manifold are canonically endowed with homotopy hypercommutative algebra structures, also known as formal homotopy Frobenius manifolds.

SGD is the standard client optimizer for on device training in cross-device FL, favored for its memory and computational efficiency. However, in centralized training of neural language models, adaptive optimizers are preferred as they offer improved stability and performance. In light of this, we ask if language models can be modified such that they can be efficiently trained with SGD client optimizers and answer this affirmatively. We propose a scale-invariant Coupled Input Forget Gate (SI CIFG) recurrent network by modifying then sigmoid and tanh activations in then recurrent cell and show that this new model converges faster and achieves better utility than the standard CIFG recurrent model in cross-device FL in large scale experiments. We further show that the proposed scale invariant modification also helps in federated learning of larger transformer models. Finally, we demonstrate the scale invariant modification is also compatible with other non-adaptive algorithms. Particularly, our results suggest an improved privacy utility trade-off in federated learning with differential privacy.\n<|end_of_solution|>",

Here we introduce Perturbed Neural Network Potential Molecular Dynamics (PNNP MD) to push back accessible time and length scales of such simulations at virtually no loss in accuracy. The total forces on the atoms are expressed in terms of the unperturbed potential energy surface represented by a standard neural network potential and a field-induced perturbation obtained from a series expansion of the field interaction truncated at first order. The latter is represented in terms of an equivariant graph neural network, trained on the atomic polar tensor. PNNP MD is shown to give excellent results for the dielectric relaxation dynamics, the dielectric constant and field-dependent IR spectrum of liquid water when compared to ab-initio molecular dynamics or experiment, up to surprisingly high field strengths of about 0.2 V\/nm. This is remarkable because, in contrast to most previous approaches, the two neural networks which PNNP MD is based on are exclusively trained on zero-field molecular configurations demonstrating that the networks not only interpolate but also reliably extrapolate the field response. PNNP MD is based on rigorous theory yet it is simple, general, modular, and systematically improvable allowing us to obtain atomistic insight into the interaction of a wide range of condensed phase systems with external electric fields.\n<|end_of_solution|>",

In this work, we argue that a broader cause of suboptimal navigation performance near humans is due to the robot's misjudgement for the human's willingness (flexibility) to share space with others, particularly when the robot assumes the human's flexibility holds constant during interaction, a phenomenon of what we call human robot pacing mismatch.

    "ground_truth":"Few-shot named entity recognition (NER) detects named entities within text using only a few annotated examples. One promising line of research is to leverage natural language descriptions of each entity type: the common label PER might, for example, be verbalized as ''person entity.'' In an initial label interpretation learning phase, the model learns to interpret such verbalized descriptions of entity types. In a subsequent few-shot tagset extension phase, this model is then given a description of a previously unseen entity type (such as ''music album'') and optionally a few training examples to perform few-shot NER for this type. In this paper, we systematically explore the impact of a strong semantic prior to interpret verbalizations of new entity types by massively scaling up the number and granularity of entity types used for label interpretation learning. To this end, we leverage an entity linking benchmark to create a dataset with orders of magnitude of more distinct entity types and descriptions as currently used datasets. We find that this increased signal yields strong results in zero- and few-shot NER in in-domain, cross-domain, and even cross-lingual settings. Our findings indicate significant potential for improving few-shot NER through heuristical data-based optimization.",

With a clear setup come intricate rules, such as: players taking turns but not in a fixed order, agreements between some players being made and broken at any time, and a player winning the game even without any chips in hand. One of the often main points of interest in studying this game, is finding when a player has a winning strategy. The game begins with four players that get eliminated successively until the winner is left. To study winning strategies, it is of interest to look at endgame situations. We present the following game setup: there are two players left in the game, Blue and Red, and only their respective chip colors. In this paper, we characterize Blue's winning situations and strategies through inductive reasoning.\n<|end_of_solution|>",

We show that odd-frequency pair correlations are synonymous with even fermion-exchange symetry in a time-dependent correlation function that generalises the two-body reduced density matrix. Macroscopic even-under-fermion-exchange pairing is found to emerge from conventional Penrose-Onsager-Yang condensation in two-body or higher-order reduced density matrices through the symetry-mixing properties of the Hamiltonian. We identify and characterise a transformer matrix responsible for producing macroscopic even fermion-exchange correlations that coexist with a conventional Cooper-pair condensate, while a generator matrix is shown to be responsible for creating macroscopic even fermion-exchange correlations from hidden orders such as a multi-particle condensate. The transformer scenario is illustrated using the spin-imbalanced Fermi superfluid as an example. The generator scenario is demonstrated by the composite-boson condensate arising from itinerant electrons coupled to magnetic excitations. Structural analysis of the transformer and generator matrices is shown to provide general conditions for odd-frequency pairing order to arise in a given system.\n\n<|end_of_solution|>",

We hope our discovery will spite the community to rethink the issue involving dataset bias and model capabilities.\n<|end_of_solution|>",

The proposed probabilistic focalization method estimates the time-varying source location in the presence of measurement-origin uncertainty. In particular, probabilistic data association is performed to match time-differences-of-arrival (TDOA) observations extracted from the acoustic signal to TDOA predictions provided by the statistical model. The performance of our approach is evaluated using real acoustic data recorded by a single mobile receiver.",
