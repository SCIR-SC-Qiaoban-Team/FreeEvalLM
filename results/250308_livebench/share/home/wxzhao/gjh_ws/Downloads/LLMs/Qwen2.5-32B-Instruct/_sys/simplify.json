      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Here is a portrait of the primatologist as a young woman. Using footage only recently rediscovered in the National Geographic archive, octogenarian Jane Goodall recollects her first field study of chimpanzees in the wild in Tanzania. This was the 1960s, and Goodall was a 26-year-old typist with no academic training. Yet on that trip she made a great leap in scientific research by observing chimps making and using tools. Goodall says that it was her mother who built her self-esteem when she was growing up – encouraging her to see beyond the expectations that a nice, middle-class girl from Bournemouth should get married and start a family. Instead, she dreamed of living with animals in the jungle like Tarzan. There are more than 40 documentaries about Goodall. What makes this one – directed by Brett Morgen, who made The Kid Stays in the Picture – essential, is Goodall’s reflective mood and the wondrous 16mm archive footage shot by Hugo van Lawick, the great wildlife photographer National Geographic sent to film her in Tanzania. The pair fell in love and married (though in the end, Goodall’s happy-ever-after was with the chimps not Van Lawick). One of his miraculous shots, of the annual great migration from Serengeti – a medley of animals gathered together like some majestic parliament of beasts – drew a gasp of wonder from a gentleman sitting behind me.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n What does it mean when dancers express emotion on stage? Do they bring real-life experiences to those highly choreographed moments when they’re leaping with ecstasy, racked by grief or, as in the climax of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring, dancing themselves to death on behalf of a fearful, threatened community? These are some of the questions posed by Goat, the raw, funny and occasionally searing new piece of dance theatre that Ben Duke has made for Rambert. The setting is an ambiguous space that is part meeting hall, part performance arena, and its “characters” are a group of dancers and musicians who have gathered to enact some kind of cathartic emotional ritual. Miguel Altunaga plays a reporter sent to describe it, and the tone at first is wickedly funny as Altunaga – a pitch perfect combination of intrusive and bewildered – tries to make sense of what’s happening. “Amazing energy,” he pronounces as the group rock through a happy-clappy ensemble. Then as the group divide into individual solos, contorting their bodies into expressions of private feeling, he trails after the dancers, hoping for elucidation. One of them, her limbs tied into an agonised knot, explains breathlessly that she’s dancing about the “stigma of addiction”. Another, his eyes rolling back in his head with exertion, says he’s expressing a sense of betrayal. It’s a brilliant riff on the worst cliches of interpretative modern dance but Duke is soon flipping the work into something deeper, darker and more personal.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "response":"Section 1\nThis news article, originally from The Guardian, is discussing a piece of dance theater named Goat, which tackles the questions of how dancers express emotions on stage and whether they bring their real-life experiences into their performances. To analyze the piece, the article first tells us about the setting and characters. The ambiguous space is a mix of a meeting hall and a performance arena. The characters are a group of dancers and musicians who are participating in a cathartic emotional ritual. \n\nSection 2\nThe text mentions Miguel Altunaga as a reporter who is observing the dance and trying to describe it. Initially, the tone of the description is humorous as Altunaga struggles to comprehend what is going on. This humorous approach is used as a tool to keep the audience engaged and creates a vivid file of the performance. \n\nSection 3\nAs the dance progresses, it develops into individual solos. Each dancer expresses different emotions, embodying private feelings like stress or pain. The dancer with agonized limbs describes her act as dancing about the \"stigma of addiction,\" while another dancer who looks like he's in pain explains that he's expressing a sense of betrayal. This further enriches our understanding of the performance. These stories and feelings create a garden of emotions which the dancers tread delicately on.\n\nSection 4\nThe author points out that the initial approach is to mock the cliches of interpretative modern dance. However, Duke's Goat soon takes a turn into a deeper exploration of emotions and personal stories. Duke uses humor as a garden hose to water the initial garden of emotions before turning to a more serious message.\n\nSection 5\nTo summarize, Goat is a stimulating and somewhat searing piece of dance theater that explores the convergence of real-life emotions and choreographed performances. The article describes it as an ambiguous space where the dancers and musicians participate in an emotional ritual. It starts off as a humorous commentary on modern dance, but quickly transitions into a profound portrayal of real-life struggles. The text is a detailed and engaging file of Goat's performance, standing as a message about the interplay of choreography and raw emotions. The outcome of Duke's work is a masterful blend of humor, seriousness, and raw emotion. <|end_of_solution|>",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Ministers have sought to see off a potential rebellion by Conservative MPs that could have brought a first defeat over the EU withdrawal bill by partially backing down on the future status of EU human rights measures in UK law. Following another day of debate about the bill, which seeks to transpose EU statute into UK law post-Brexit, the government faced possible defeat over amendments intended to maintain the scope of the EU charter on fundamental rights. Several of the amendments were tabled by Dominic Grieve, the Tory former attorney general and a leading Brexit rebel, with speculation that enough of his fellow Tories would back some of these to inflict defeat. However, the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, said the government was willing to work with Grieve to see how rights under the charter could be kept after Brexit, and would introduce its own amendment to this effect later in the bill’s passage. Grieve said this was sufficient reassurance for him and that he would not press for a vote on his amendments. Ken Clarke, another leading Conservative Brexit rebel, refused to guarantee he would not press for a vote on one amendment, which would allow Britons to mount legal challenges under the charter after Brexit, to which he was the second signatory after Grieve. However, with Grieve backing away, the chances of a government defeat were notably lessened if a vote was called. Buckland said he did not fully agree with Grieve’s amendment, which would allow challenges to EU law retained after Brexit “on the grounds that it is in breach of general principles of EU law”, and questioned whether it would add anything “that is relevant or material” to existing rights. But Buckland said: “Let me say that we do recognise the strength of views from my right honourable friend and, indeed, from other honourable members and honourable friends on this issue – many of whom have spoken this afternoon. “We’re listening, and we are prepared to look again at this issue to make sure that we are taking an approach that can command the support of this house.” Buckland said he would happily discuss a way forward with Grieve, “and agree to work together with us in this shared endeavour”, which would result in a government amendment in the report stage, the next part of the bill’s passage through the Commons.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The government partially backed down on the issue by working with Grieve and promising to introduce their own amendment later in the bill’s passage.\n\\n\\nThen, I will explain Ken Clarke's stance and its impact on the possibility of a government defeat. Clarke, another leading Conservative Brexit rebel, refused to guarantee he would not press for a vote on an amendment allowing Britons to mount legal challenges under the charter after Brexit. However, with Grieve backing away, the chances of a government defeat were notably lessened.\n\\n\\nFinally, I will describe the government's position on Grieve's amendment and their willingness to work with him. The solicitor general, Robert Buckland, questioned the relevance of Grieve's amendment but stated that the government was prepared to look again at this issue and work with Grieve.\n<|end_of_thought|> \n\nSection 3\n<|begin_of_solution|> \n* In simple terms, the UK government faced a potential rebellion from Conservative MPs over the EU withdrawal bill. The MPs wanted to keep EU human rights measures in UK law after Brexit, so the government promised to work with them and introduced their own amendment to address the issue. Although Ken Clarke refused to guarantee he would not press for a vote, the chances of a government defeat were notably lessened.\n<|end_of_solution|> \n\nP.S. Is there anything else I can help with?",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In 1612, a contemporary of Shakespeare’s, the playwright Thomas Heywood, published An Apology for Actors, in which he expressed a patriotic sentiment about the English language, boastful at the time, which now seems unexceptional: Our English tongue, which hath been the most harsh, uneven and broken language of the world... is now continually refined, every writer striving in himself to add a new flourish unto it; so that it is grown into a most perfect and composed language. The coming of age of English at the beginning of the 17th century, after a golden generation of extraordinary growth and innovation, is symbolised by the publication of a landmark edition that the playwright himself had never bothered with in his own lifetime. Indeed, it was not until seven years after his death, thanks to the First Folio, that his work began slowly to acquire the canonical status it enjoys today. Towards the end of November 1623, the bookseller Edward Blount, who traded at the sign of the Black Bear near St Paul’s, finally held in his hands the text of a great volume for which he had long been waiting: Mr William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories &amp; Tragedies. Published according to the True Originall Copies. In the words of one critic: “It is hard to overstate the importance of this literary, cultural and commercial moment.” The book now known as the First Folio (the first authoritative edition of Shakespeare’s plays) established “Shakespeare” for all time and it did this in two principal ways. First, it collects some 36 plays, including 18 scripts (notably Macbeth, Julius Caesar, As You Like It and The Tempest) which would be otherwise unknown. The trove of work thus assembled gave posterity not just a cast of immortal characters (Bottom, Falstaff, Lear, Portia, Jaques, Prospero et al), but also a heap of new words (including, for example, catastrophe, exaggerate, assassinate, indifference, monopoly and paradox). Second, it definitively connects his contemporary Ben Jonson (who declared his rival to be “the soul of the age”) and some of the actors who had first performed these plays with the historical person, the playwright himself, a figure helpfully illustrated by a famous frontispiece, the engraved portrait of the artist that has become an icon of “Shakespeare studies”. Other facts about the First Folio, a canon of incomparable power and authority, and the text that would help launch Shakespeare’s global literary afterlife are indisputable: both its value (somewhere north of $5m in rare books’ sales) and its comparative rarity (approximately 240 copies survive worldwide in public and private collections).\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.  Answer with at least 210 words. Your answer must contain a title, wrapped in double angular brackets, such as <<poem of joy>>."

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In 1612, a contemporary of Shakespeare’s, the playwright Thomas Heywood, published An Apology for Actors, in which he expressed a patriotic sentiment about the English language, boastful at the time, which now seems unexceptional: Our English tongue, which hath been the most harsh, uneven and broken language of the world... is now continually refined, every writer striving in himself to add a new flourish unto it; so that it is grown into a most perfect and composed language. The coming of age of English at the beginning of the 17th century, after a golden generation of extraordinary growth and innovation, is symbolised by the publication of a landmark edition that the playwright himself had never bothered with in his own lifetime. Indeed, it was not until seven years after his death, thanks to the First Folio, that his work began slowly to acquire the canonical status it enjoys today. Towards the end of November 1623, the bookseller Edward Blount, who traded at the sign of the Black Bear near St Paul’s, finally held in his hands the text of a great volume for which he had long been waiting: Mr William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories &amp; Tragedies. Published according to the True Originall Copies. In the words of one critic: “It is hard to overstate the importance of this literary, cultural and commercial moment.” The book now known as the First Folio (the first authoritative edition of Shakespeare’s plays) established “Shakespeare” for all time and it did this in two principal ways. First, it collects some 36 plays, including 18 scripts (notably Macbeth, Julius Caesar, As You Like It and The Tempest) which would be otherwise unknown. The trove of work thus assembled gave posterity not just a cast of immortal characters (Bottom, Falstaff, Lear, Portia, Jaques, Prospero et al), but also a heap of new words (including, for example, catastrophe, exaggerate, assassinate, indifference, monopoly and paradox). Second, it definitively connects his contemporary Ben Jonson (who declared his rival to be “the soul of the age”) and some of the actors who had first performed these plays with the historical person, the playwright himself, a figure helpfully illustrated by a famous frontispiece, the engraved portrait of the artist that has become an icon of “Shakespeare studies”. Other facts about the First Folio, a canon of incomparable power and authority, and the text that would help launch Shakespeare’s global literary afterlife are indisputable: both its value (somewhere north of $5m in rare books’ sales) and its comparative rarity (approximately 240 copies survive worldwide in public and private collections).\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Ratko Mladić, the Serb warlord who terrorised Bosnia in the 1990s, was on Wednesday forcibly removed from court after a shouting outburst delayed the reading of the verdict in his trial for the last genocide committed in Europe. The long-anticipated verdict was previously delayed for half an hour after Mladic asked the judge if he could take a short bathroom break. The delay was extended as rumours began to circulate that the former Bosnian Serb commander, who had appeared healthy when sitting in court, had suddenly been taken ill. As he entered the ICTY courtroom, Mladic had infuriated relatives of the victims as gave a broad smile and gave a thumbs up to the cameras. Mladić, who was commander of the Bosnian Serb army during the 1992-95 Bosnian conflict and for several years was one of the world’s most wanted fugitives, is now 74 and in poor health. His lawyers have argued he is not well enough to hear his verdict and sentence in person, but it is not clear whether they will seek a last-minute postponement. A judge has already rejected a defence effort earlier this month to have the judgment put off. The trial in The Hague, which took 530 days spread over more than four years, is arguably the most significant war crimes case in Europe since the Nuremberg tribunal, in part because of the scale of the atrocities involved. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) heard from 591 witnesses and examined nearly 10,000 exhibits concerning 106 separate crimes. Legal scholars say Mladić is almost certain to be found guilty of genocide for the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995, where more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were killed, most by summary execution. The Bosnian Serb political leader, Radovan Karadžić, was convicted of genocide last year for his role in the Srebrenica killings.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The referendum was held 10 days later. Vote Leave told Grimes on 14 June that it had decided to donate £400,000 to him, the day after Vote Leave itself received a £1m donation, and Grimes provided his AIQ reference number for the payment to be made directly. “It appears Mr Grimes was in a position to make arrangements with AIQ to provide services to him on 13 June ... before receiving confirmation of the amount to be donated,” the review said.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n From cricketer Wasim Akram to baseball pitcher Clayton Kershaw and table tennis star Ding Ning, the world of sport has no shortage of left-handed players. But now researchers say they’ve worked out why lefties are overrepresented in some elite sports but not others. The study, published in the journal Biology Letters, suggests that being left-handed is a particular advantage in interactive sports where time pressures are particularly severe, such as table tennis and cricket – possibly because their moves are less familiar to their mostly right-handed opponents, who do not have time to adjust. “The data suggests that the heavier the time constraints are operating in a sport, the larger the proportion of left-handers,” said the study’s author, Dr Florian Loffing of the University of Oldenburg in Germany. “We are less used to playing lefties, and [so] might end up in not developing the optimal strategies to compete with them.” While it is thought that about 10-13% of the population is left-handed, it has long been noted that in certain interactive sports there is often a surprisingly high proportion of left-handers playing at elite levels. Southpaw stars have seen significant success in sport, with big names including baseball aces Sandy Koufax and Randy Johnson, cricketers Garfield Sobers and Mitchell Johnson and table tennis’s Wang Nan and Kasumi Ishikawa. Previous research has punted a number of possible explanations, including that left-handers have more efficient connections between the two hemispheres of their brain. Others have suggested that lefties have the edge due to an element of surprise: since most players are right-handed, players will be more used to playing against right-handed partners. But the question remained: why did different sports show such different proportions of left-handed players? To probe the issue, Loffing collected the names and handedness of the top 100 or so players for badminton, squash, tennis, table tennis and – for men only – cricket and baseball, across six years between 2009 and 2014.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n From cricketer Wasim Akram to baseball pitcher Clayton Kershaw and table tennis star Ding Ning, the world of sport has no shortage of left-handed players. But now researchers say they’ve worked out why lefties are overrepresented in some elite sports but not others. The study, published in the journal Biology Letters, suggests that being left-handed is a particular advantage in interactive sports where time pressures are particularly severe, such as table tennis and cricket – possibly because their moves are less familiar to their mostly right-handed opponents, who do not have time to adjust. “The data suggests that the heavier the time constraints are operating in a sport, the larger the proportion of left-handers,” said the study’s author, Dr Florian Loffing of the University of Oldenburg in Germany. “We are less used to playing lefties, and [so] might end up in not developing the optimal strategies to compete with them.” While it is thought that about 10-13% of the population is left-handed, it has long been noted that in certain interactive sports there is often a surprisingly high proportion of left-handers playing at elite levels. Southpaw stars have seen significant success in sport, with big names including baseball aces Sandy Koufax and Randy Johnson, cricketers Garfield Sobers and Mitchell Johnson and table tennis’s Wang Nan and Kasumi Ishikawa. Previous research has punted a number of possible explanations, including that left-handers have more efficient connections between the two hemispheres of their brain. Others have suggested that lefties have the edge due to an element of surprise: since most players are right-handed, players will be more used to playing against right-handed partners. But the question remained: why did different sports show such different proportions of left-handed players? To probe the issue, Loffing collected the names and handedness of the top 100 or so players for badminton, squash, tennis, table tennis and – for men only – cricket and baseball, across six years between 2009 and 2014.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

It is conducted “with great sensitivity”. “The playing and choral singing are outstanding”. This may well put people off from going to see this challenging but fascinating new work – essentially for following the book rather than the Hitchcock film, something that the composer and librettist have made explicit.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n I was at the dress rehearsal of Marnie at the ENO which was received rapturously by the audience. What a pity that Tim Ashley’s review has such a dismissive heading (A psychological thriller that fails to deliver a thrill, 20 November) when in the review he says it is “superbly done”, praises the singers and their acting, and the staging for its “elegant fluidity”. It is conducted “with great sensitivity”. “The playing and choral singing are outstanding”. This may well put people off from going to see this challenging but fascinating new work – essentially for following the book rather than the Hitchcock film, something that the composer and librettist have made explicit. Sarah Carter Canterbury • A colleague speaking about his home country assured me: “In Pakistan politicians make money while in office whereas in the UK they do it after they leave.” Kezia Dugdale could show a bit more respect for this time-honoured tradition (Labour split as Dugdale joins reality TV show, 21 November). The pace of the MSP’s new move has the appearance of premature remuneration. Geoff Reid Bradford • Can anyone explain why Cornwall, the second poorest region in northern Europe (Letters, 18 November), has six Conservative MPs? Is this a textbook example of Marx’s false consciousness? David Kennedy Menston, West Yorkshire • Further to Tony Fletcher’s reference to “milky coffee” (Letters, 20 November), a coffee stall in a park in Edinburgh in the mid-19th century offered “café au lait, with or without milk”.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "response":"Section 1\n<<Simplifying the Guardian's News Article>>\n\nThese beginning sentences of a news article by The Guardian are a collection of letters and opinions from readers. The first letter relates to a music review which seemed to have a contrasting headline to the content. The writer lamented the aforementioned article's dismissive heading that could potentially deter viewers from a 'superbly done' ENO production despite the review indicating a largely positive reception. The second piece expresses a dry reminder about UK politicians' 'time-honoured tradition' regarding remuneration post-office following a Labour MP, Kezia Dugdale's entrance into a reality TV show. It insinuates her actions as an unusually swift and possibly premature remuneration post-office that breaks the standard UK tradition. The third snippet is a query regarding the six Conservative MPs in Cornwall, the second poorest region in northern Europe, drawing attention to a possible contradiction. The last part presents a humorous, historical anecdote about a 'milk-included' coffee stall during the mid-19th century in Edinburgh, effectively serving as a reward break in the passage.\n\nEvidence, such as the use of bonus (reward in the form of historical anecdote), break (pause by the humorous story), cap (on politicians' post-political office income), evidence (Cornwall's status as second poorest region), passage (the collection of letters\/forms a continuous piece), when put together, reveal a jigsaw of societal observations and historical musings that make up everyday happenings and peculiarities for the readers.\n\nAny other questions?",

Dugdale was reportedly told by the party not to go, but went anyway, joining a roll of parliamentarians from Nadine Dorries to Penny Mordaunt who have tried reality TV as a career accelerant, with, it is only fair to say, mixed results. Dugdale herself has not yet landed in the jungle, where the other contestants – not including many household names – are already breakfasting on bugs, weeping silently on camera etc etc. My money is on Stanley Johnson, father of Boris, who at some point will reveal that at his prep school funnel-web spiders were a delicacy and the washing facilities in the bush are a definite improvement.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Taylor Swift’s Reputation has become the biggest-selling album of the year in the US in a single week, with 1.23m sales. That total comfortably beats the 931,000 copies of ÷ sold by Ed Sheeran since he released it in early March. Swift has kept all but four songs from Reputation off streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, meaning that fans need to pay to download the album or buy it on CD if they want to hear it. She also, somewhat controversially, created a promotion where fans who bought multiple copies of the album increased their chances of getting tickets to her upcoming tour, thus further driving sales. Nielsen, which collates album sales data in the US, said that Reputation sold more copies than the rest of the top 200 albums put together. Swift’s previous three albums have all sold more than a million copies in the US in their first week– a feat increasingly difficult to achieve as the popularity of downloads and CDs continues to wane. Her label Big Machine reported that a further 905,000 copies were sold worldwide, 84,000 of which were in the UK, which gives it the sixth-largest first week UK sales of the year, behind albums by Sam Smith, Liam Gallagher, Take That, Rag’N’Bone Man and Swift’s friend Ed Sheeran, who sold 671,000 copies of ÷ in the first week of its release. Swift’s impressive US total is still some way off the all-time first week sales record set by Adele in 2015, when her album 25 sold 3.37m copies in the US in its opening week. Forbes, meanwhile, has estimated that Swift is the third highest-earning female musician in 2017, dropping from the top spot last year when her earnings were driven by tour revenues from her previous album, 1989. She was estimated to have earned $44m (£33m) this year, below Beyoncé, whose Formation world tour helped generate earnings of $105m (£79m), and Adele, who earned $69m (£52m).\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "response":"\"Taylor Swift's latest album, Reputation, has performed impressively by becoming the biggest-selling album of the year in America within a single week, with 1.23 million copies sold. This achievement significantly surpasses the sales of Ed Sheeran's album ÷, which only sold about 931,000 copies since its release in March. One of Swift's strategies was to keep most of her songs off streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music, forcing fans to buy the album physically or digital if they want to hear it. Swift also encouraged buying multiple copies of the album with a promotion that increased people's chances of getting concert tickets with each additional purchase, which effectively boosted sales. An interesting statistic provided by Nielsen, the company tracking album sales in the US, is that Swift's Reputation sold more copies than the combined total of the rest of the top 200 albums. Swift has a history of exceeding 1 million sales in the US during the first week of album releases, a rare accomplishment as the popularity of downloads and CDs falls. Apart from the US, Reputation also did reasonably well globally, with an additional 905,000 copies sold worldwide, including 84,000 in the UK, placing it sixth in terms of the top-selling albums this year in the country. Despite the high sales, Swift's first-week numbers didn't match the record set by Adele, who sold 3.37 million copies of her 25 album in its first week back in 2015. Lastly, Taylor Swift is considered the third highest-earning female musician in 2017 by Forbes, with an estimated $44 million, despite being the top earner last year due to tour revenues from her previous album, 1989. Her earnings are lower than Beyoncé's and Adele's that same year, who earned $105 million and $69 million, respectively, mostly from their tours.\n\nMentioning how this news might impact the music industry and Taylor Swift's popularity, this impressive set of sales sends a strong signal to the music industry. It suggests that while the music market is rapidly moving towards streaming, there is still significant demand for physical and digital album purchases. Moreover, it underscores Swift's immense popularity and her powerful influence over her fanbase. The strategies she employed to increase her album sales further highlight the importance of appealing directly to fans and using unique promotions to drive interest and purchases. On a personal note, Swift's earnings position indicates that despite her transition from the top spot, she maintains a robust financial position within the music industry, reinforcing her status as a dominant female performer and proving her continued relevance in an increasingly competitive field. This is particularly important for female artists, as Swift's success can inspire other women in the industry to develop and execute their own creative strategies to maintain high sales and revenue numbers. Her overall sales performance also suggests a potential shift or at least a compelling trend that could influence how other artists approach album sales and promotion in the future.\"",

History lesson Kazan considers itself Russia’s “sporting capital” and the Kazan Arena is one of an impressive array of stylish, modern – and expensive – sporting facilities to have sprung up there in recent years. It was designed by Populous, the architects behind Wembley and the Emirates, and was built in time for the 2013 Summer Universiade, where it hosted football and athletics. As a sleek, modern facility it will serve the World Cup well – even if it will, amazingly, be one of the tournament’s oldest stadiums. Star attraction Anyone who gets lost en route should just look for the high-definition screen – the world’s biggest outdoor one, organisers proudly proclaim – on the side of the stadium. It covers 4,030 square metres and will probably bear both competing nations’ flags on a given matchday. Those arriving from the air may want to appreciate the waterlily-themed roof of this riverside stadium. Any hitches? Nothing major.

Star attraction Anyone who gets lost en route should just look for the high-definition screen – the world’s biggest outdoor one, organisers proudly proclaim – on the side of the stadium. It covers 4,030 square metres and will probably bear both competing nations’ flags on a given matchday. Those arriving from the air may want to appreciate the waterlily-themed roof of this riverside stadium. Any hitches? Nothing major. The Confederations Cup was a successful dry run and the Russia v Iran friendly went off without any problems in October.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Because it is bounded on three sides by a Grade II listed wall, only the fourth side has windows. So it’s a revelation to come inside and be struck by the sense of space and light in here.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Apple has been accused of relying on students working illegal overtime to build the iPhone X, through its contractor Foxconn, which manufactures the devices in Zhengzhou, China. According to the Financial Times, students working at the Foxconn plant, as part of a three month “work experience” placement, were routinely working 11-hour days assembling the newest phone, breaking Chinese overtime laws in the process. Student labour is common, and legal, in manufacturing hubs in China. The students must be paid, and the placements must be voluntary, with the number of temporary workers swelling employment at the Zhengzhou factory threefold in the busiest time of the year, the paper reported. But, according to the Financial Times, such work experience should be limited to just 40 hours a week. Six high school students, out of a group of 3,000 from one vocational school sent to work at the factory, told the paper that those legal limits were exceeded. In a statement, Apple said: “During the course of a recent audit, we discovered instances of student interns working overtime at a supplier facility in China. We’ve confirmed the students worked voluntarily, were compensated and provided benefits, but they should not have been allowed to work overtime.” “At this facility, student intern programs are short term and account for a very small percentage of the workforce. When we found that some students were allowed to work overtime, we took prompt action. A team of specialists are on site at the facility working with the management on systems to ensure the appropriate standards are adhered to.” “Apple is dedicated to ensuring everyone in our supply chain is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n A massive search and rescue operation has intensified to find the Argentinian navy submarine ARA San Juan that went missing six days ago in the South Atlantic. If the crew are still alive the submarine would only have one day’s worth of oxygen reserves left. If the vessel is found, a submarine rescue chamber (SCR) will be lowered to couple with the vessel’s hatch and bring the crew up to the surface six members at a time.

If the vessel is found, the SCR will be lowered down a cable to try to couple up for the rescue. A total of 49 ships and aircraft from Argentina, the US, the UK, Brazil, Chile and other countries were taking advantage of improved weather conditions to search an area larger than the state of California. More than 100 personnel were participating in the rescue operation, including US and Argentinian navy operatives. The US navy said it was deploying four unmanned undersea vehicles in the search .

As a 24-year-old, I am so often forced to listen to my elders’ indignation for my choosing to take a holiday, or have a meal out with friends when every penny I earn should be saved for a house. When you consider increasing prices and decreasing availability of property in the UK, along with the banks’ appetites to lend being lower than ever, it’s unlikely I will ever own my own home. Perhaps I just need to accept that thousands of us are destined to spend the rest of our lives throwing all of our money at the people who own the properties we rent from them while they complain about how irresponsible we are. Sam Webb Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands • Have you heard about the massive discounts available for the under-25s? Unfortunately not; in reality the only thing reduced for us is our wages. Under-25s are excluded from the pitiful “national living wage”. From 21-24 we can be paid as little as £7.05 per hour, and for 18-20 a shocking £5.60 for doing exactly the same hours in exactly the same job. Even working full-time a 24-year-old might get as little as £14,500 per annum. And we’re far more likely to be on a zero-hours contract.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.  Your answer must contain exactly 5 bullet points.

As a 24-year-old, I am so often forced to listen to my elders’ indignation for my choosing to take a holiday, or have a meal out with friends when every penny I earn should be saved for a house. When you consider increasing prices and decreasing availability of property in the UK, along with the banks’ appetites to lend being lower than ever, it’s unlikely I will ever own my own home. Perhaps I just need to accept that thousands of us are destined to spend the rest of our lives throwing all of our money at the people who own the properties we rent from them while they complain about how irresponsible we are. Sam Webb Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands • Have you heard about the massive discounts available for the under-25s? Unfortunately not; in reality the only thing reduced for us is our wages. Under-25s are excluded from the pitiful “national living wage”. From 21-24 we can be paid as little as £7.05 per hour, and for 18-20 a shocking £5.60 for doing exactly the same hours in exactly the same job. Even working full-time a 24-year-old might get as little as £14,500 per annum. And we’re far more likely to be on a zero-hours contract.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.  Your answer must contain exactly 5 bullet points.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n MPs have accused the government of failing to protect consumers over the price it has promised to pay for power from the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant. The Commons public accounts committee said the subsidy contract for Hinkley Point C, agreed in 2016 after years of delays, would hit poorest households hardest. The power station is expected to cost billpayers £30bn over the lengthy of the 35-year contract, adding £10-£15 to the average household energy bill. But an assessment by the committee concluded that no one in Whitehall was championing consumers’ interests during negotiations with French company EDF Energy. The final bill for consumers was exacerbated by government not renegotiating the guaranteed power price for fear that EDF and its Chinese partner CGN would walk away from the project, which the MPs said was a questionable assumption. Officials agreed a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour in 2013 but fossil fuel price projections fell between then and the contract being signed in 2016, pushing the cost to consumers up fivefold from £6bn to £30bn. At the time the Department of Energy and Climate Change – now the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy – did not consider a ceiling on the guaranteed price, the MPs were told. Meg Hillier, chair of the group of MPs, said: “Billpayers have been dealt a bad hand by the government in its approach to this project.” The criticism from the committee follows a damning report by the UK’s spending watchdog, the NAO, which found the contract for Hinkley had locked consumers into a “risky and expensive project”. The NAO attacked the government for failing to explore alternative financing models, such as taking stake in the project, a criticism that the MPs echoed. The public accounts committee said it was also disappointed that the government appeared to have no plan in place to maximise the wider benefits of the project, beyond the clean power it will provide.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Faiz Siddiqui alleges the “inadequate” teaching he received on the Indian special subject part of his modern history course resulted in him getting only a low upper second degree when he took his finals in June 2000 instead of a first or high 2:1. Siddiqui, 39, has blamed the situation on a number of members of staff being absent on sabbatical leave and a failure to find cover. He has also alleged that a tutor failed to submit medical information about him to examiners. He claims he would have become an international commercial lawyer if he had gained the top qualification at the end of his time at Brasenose College, and that his clinical depression and insomnia have been significantly exacerbated by his “inexplicable failure”. The legal battle between Siddiqui and Oxford has been ongoing for more than a year. Last year a judge allowed Siddiqui’s action to proceed to be fully argued after Oxford claimed the case had no merit and had been brought outside the legal time limit. It was decided at the time that Siddiqui had a real chance of persuading a judge that the case was not time-barred or that it would be just for it to proceed in any event. At the high court in London on Tuesday, Siddiqui’s barrister, Roger Mallalieu, told Mr Justice Foskett that in 2000 Siddiqui was a “driven young man” aiming for a postgraduate qualification from an Ivy League university before a career at the tax bar in England or a major US law firm. “Whilst a 2:1 degree from Oxford might rightly seem like a tremendous achievement to most, it fell significantly short of Mr Siddiqui’s expectations and was, to him, a huge disappointment,” Mallalieu said.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

In June 2000, Siddiqui, who is now 39, graduated with a low upper second degree, but he believes the inadequate teaching and lack of staff led to this outcome. He also asserts that a tutor failed to submit medical information about him to the examiners. Siddiqui believes he would have secured a career as an international commercial lawyer if he had achieved a higher degree. His clinical depression and insomnia have worsened as a result of the \"inexplicable failure.\" The legal battle between Siddiqui and Oxford has progressed for over a year, with a judge stating that he has a realistic chance of succeeding in the case. In 2000, Siddiqui aimed for a postgraduate qualification from an Ivy League university before securing a career at the tax bar in England or a major US law firm. However, his low grade from Oxford, although still an impressive achievement for most, was a massive disappointment to him.\nSECTION 2\nP.P.S This lawsuit reflects the high expectations set by students and the significant impact a lower-than-expected degree can have on their career prospects and mental health. The case against Oxford University explores the possibility that insufficient support and teaching quality led to Siddiqui's dissatisfaction with his degree and subsequent career trajectory.",

    "response":"<|begin_of_thought|>\nFirst, let's break down the text to understand the structure and context. The text appears to be a summary of four different television shows broadcasting at 9pm across different channels. Each synopsis contains details about the content and what viewers can expect.\n\n1. Starting with Blue Planet II, which is a documentary series about the underwater world.\n2. Howard’s End is a series adaption of E.M. Forster's classic novel but with modern casting. The synopsis provides context about the two main characters and a story point regarding character development and potential conflict.\n3. Expedition Volcano is a documentary series that highlights the team’s journey to study an active volcano.\n4. The last one is Guy Martin vs the Robot Car, which is likely a competitive program where the car racer competes against a self-driving vehicle.\n\nNext, I'll simplify those descriptions to make them accessible to a broader audience.\n\nSimplification of #1: A show that dives under the ocean, showcasing beautiful sea life, including some interesting underwater creatures and events, like a sea cucumber consuming starfish in a way that evokes the Sarlacc pit from Star Wars. Additionally, it highlights how some species, like the Garibaldi damselfish and the cuttlefish, interact with their environment and each other.\n\nSimplification of #2: This is an adaptation of a traditional story that follows the lives of two sisters and their interactions with a suitor named Henry. This episode includes a proposal that's met with unexpected complications as well as difficulties for a supporting character who faces hardship due to decisions made by the sisters. \n\nSimplification of #3: This show features a team of scientists studying the dangerous Mount Nyiragongo in Congo. They live next to the active volcano all while doing tests to understand better the associated risks and how to handle them.\n\nSimplification of #4: A race event pitting a human (Guy Martin) against a robot car. The objective is to explore what it entails to compete with modern technologies in car racing.\n\nAfter simplifying the descriptions, the main point of a headline or a summary for each would convey simplicity, excitement, and intrigue to engage general audiences regardless of their prior understanding. Let's craft such headlines that mirror this idea.\n\n#1 Headline: \"Blue Planet II: Oceans Revealed\" - Dive into the mysterious underwater universe and acquaint yourself with the intricate and sometimes scary lives of underwater creatures and their interactions.\n#2 Headline: \"Howards End: Choices and Consequences\" - Embody the world of Margaret and Henry, experience a love story filled with dramatic turns, and follow the journey of a character impacted by their actions.\n#3 Headline: \"Expedition Volcano: Science at the Edge\" - Witness the perilous expedition of scientists who conquer their fears to study one of the world's most spectacular active volcanoes.\n#4 Headline: \"Guy Martin vs the Robot Car: The Race to Stay Relevant\" - Join in a man versus machine competition where Guy Martin doubts the permanence of his expertise as a racer in the face of autonomous vehicles.\n\nEach headline provides key ideas, thrilling elements, and invites exploration of different worlds - from underwater life to a historic love story, hazardous scientific research, and a struggle of relevance. Such headlines can spark interest and invite diverse viewers to give these shows a chance. \n\nFinally, I'll synthesize this information into a straightforward and engaging summary that accurately represents the content but in simpler terms.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nThese sentences are taken from the start of a news item from The Guardian about four television shows airing at 9pm, providing brief overviews of their content for potential viewers. \n\n\"Blue Planet II\" invites audiences into the beautiful and fascinating underwater world, showcasing the lives of various species, with a focus on how they interact with their environment. \n\nIn \"Howards End,\" the story of Margaret - one of the sisters at the center of the novel - is highlighted. This show takes a deep dive into her life, including a dramatic story point involving a marriage proposal, and a consequent emerging conflict that throws her romance into turmoil, in addition to the struggles of a supporting character, Leonard.\n\n\"Expedition Volcano\" has a team of scientists conducting research on Mount Nyiragongo, a powerful active volcano in Congo, illustrating the risks and testing the limits of living next to one of Earth's most spectacular but dangerous natural features.\n\nLastly, \"Guy Martin vs the Robot Car\" portrays Guy Martin in a battle of human skill versus technology's advancement, as a prototype of an autonomous racing car competes with the professional racer. This event reflects on the times when humanity's expertise is challenged by modern inventions.\n\nThese summaries encapsulate the essence of each show, highlighting their unique themes and the possible interests they could have for viewers based on their content and the angle the writers chose to focus on.

However, with the NHS's performance declining dramatically, particularly in the areas of increasing waiting times for A&E and admissions, this crisis has become undeniable. Even top healthcare officials now publicly acknowledge the severity of the issue and are urging the government for immediate action in the coming budget.\n\nMarkedly, although some aspects of the NHS may indeed operate well, the overall situation is far from satisfactory.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n St Andrew’s Day, which falls at the end of this month, is celebrated as the feast day of Scotland’s patron saint and a last hurrah before we disappear under an avalanche of mince pies and mulled wine. And if there’s one thing the Scots are good at, apart from politics, economics, terriers and whisky, it’s an honest broth. According to the Victorian journalist and author Christian Isobel Johnstone, who published her The Cook and Housewife’s Manual under the pseudonym Margaret Dods: “The French take the lead of all European people in soups and broths … the Scotch rank second, the Welsh next, and … the English, as a nation, are at the very bottom of the scale.” As an Edinburgh native, she may have been biased, but when one considers the likes of cullen skink, Scotch broth and our subject here, cock-a-leekie, it’s hard not to concede the point. The last, occasionally known as cockie-leekie, is often dated to the end of the 16th century, when the Lincolnshire-born traveller Fynes Moryson records having been served “pullet with some prunes in the broth” at a knight’s house in Scotland, although, given the widespread medieval tradition of meat and fruit pottages, it seems likely that similar dishes were once found throughout northern Europe – even (horror!) south of the border. Happily for us, however, this particular version remained popular in Scotland, and feels a pleasingly simple and wholesome celebratory dish to prepare the stomach for the month to come. The chicken As ever, many recipes call for what the redoubtable Maw Broon calls “an auld boiling fowl” (thanks to Twitter friend of the column Jon Dryden Taylor for supplying the recipe), which is, as we have seen previously, an appropriately tough thing to get hold of in 21st-century Britain. Catherine Brown reckons that “attempting a modern cock-a-leekie with an immature battery chicken is akin to attempting cassoulet without confit”, and, in the absence of decent chicken recommends using “a more flavourful pheasant or other game bird – cock or hen – which has roamed freely”. Having tried her recipe, I can confirm that pheasant makes a delicious soup, even when enjoyed from a bowl in a warm kitchen, rather than from a Thermos in the middle of a damp autumnal copse, but one with a distinct gamey character. Feel free to use pheasant here, if that’s what you have, but chicken, to some extent the older the better, remains the classic choice.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n St Andrew’s Day, which falls at the end of this month, is celebrated as the feast day of Scotland’s patron saint and a last hurrah before we disappear under an avalanche of mince pies and mulled wine. And if there’s one thing the Scots are good at, apart from politics, economics, terriers and whisky, it’s an honest broth. According to the Victorian journalist and author Christian Isobel Johnstone, who published her The Cook and Housewife’s Manual under the pseudonym Margaret Dods: “The French take the lead of all European people in soups and broths … the Scotch rank second, the Welsh next, and … the English, as a nation, are at the very bottom of the scale.” As an Edinburgh native, she may have been biased, but when one considers the likes of cullen skink, Scotch broth and our subject here, cock-a-leekie, it’s hard not to concede the point. The last, occasionally known as cockie-leekie, is often dated to the end of the 16th century, when the Lincolnshire-born traveller Fynes Moryson records having been served “pullet with some prunes in the broth” at a knight’s house in Scotland, although, given the widespread medieval tradition of meat and fruit pottages, it seems likely that similar dishes were once found throughout northern Europe – even (horror!) south of the border. Happily for us, however, this particular version remained popular in Scotland, and feels a pleasingly simple and wholesome celebratory dish to prepare the stomach for the month to come. The chicken As ever, many recipes call for what the redoubtable Maw Broon calls “an auld boiling fowl” (thanks to Twitter friend of the column Jon Dryden Taylor for supplying the recipe), which is, as we have seen previously, an appropriately tough thing to get hold of in 21st-century Britain. Catherine Brown reckons that “attempting a modern cock-a-leekie with an immature battery chicken is akin to attempting cassoulet without confit”, and, in the absence of decent chicken recommends using “a more flavourful pheasant or other game bird – cock or hen – which has roamed freely”. Having tried her recipe, I can confirm that pheasant makes a delicious soup, even when enjoyed from a bowl in a warm kitchen, rather than from a Thermos in the middle of a damp autumnal copse, but one with a distinct gamey character. Feel free to use pheasant here, if that’s what you have, but chicken, to some extent the older the better, remains the classic choice.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Charlie Rose was fired by CBS News on Tuesday, as his colleagues reacted with shock and horror to allegations of serial sexual harassment made against the veteran TV news show anchor – and made it clear they believe the women. In a statement, the CBS News president, David Rhodes, said his behavior was “extremely disturbing and intolerable”. “What may once have been accepted should not ever have been acceptable.” Rose said in a statement on Monday: “I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.” Asked if he has anything to say to the women who had accused him of “wrongdoings”, he replied: “It’s not wrongdoings.” Co-hosts of CBS This Morning Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell presented the show without their usual third team member, Rose, on Tuesday and broke away from their normal news reporting style to give raw, personal opinions on the behavior alleged against him. “This is a moment that demands a frank and honest assessment about where we stand and, more generally, the safety of women,” O’Donnell began. The show had opened with a straight news report on a story that now involved their own station. A CBS This Morning reporter related the facts that Rose, 75, had been suspended from his job while the company looks into detailed accusations from eight women that he had made unwanted sexual advances towards them, as revealed by the Washington Post. Allegations include lewd phone calls, walking around naked in their presence, or groping their breasts, buttocks or genital areas, and the women were employees or aspired to work for Rose at the Charlie Rose show from the late 1990s to 2011, the Post reported. “It takes a lot of courage for these women to come forward,” said O’Donnell.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n ‘I hate talking about my work.” Sally Cookson squirms. Her shows, for all their simplicity, can be hard to pin down, but her words are telling: “I’m always looking for the heart of a story,” she says. This is a director who deals in feelings. To those not paying attention, Cookson landed like a bolt from the blue. Most directors cut through in their 30s, but she was in her 50s when her circus-heavy staging of Jacqueline Wilson’s Hetty Feather was nominated for an Olivier award in 2015. Her calling card, however, was a magnificent, two-part Jane Eyre, a total theatre treat that translated Charlotte Brontë’s book into movement and music, colour and light. Since its premiere at the Bristol Old Vic in 2014, more than 250,000 people have seen it on stage or on screen – possibly unprecedented for a piece of devised theatre. It’s why, last year, Cookson got the National Theatre’s Olivier stage for Christmas – arguably the biggest family slot of the year – to put on Peter Pan. This year, as a mark of her newfound bankability, Marianne Elliott’s new commercial company has backed her to bring Narnia to life in Leeds. The West Yorkshire Playhouse has even boosted its capacity for the purpose, transforming its 750-seat amphitheatre into a vast, 1,000-plus theatre in the round.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n While indulging in booze can inspire cheerful merrymaking in some, for others it can lead to a tearful journey to the bottom of the glass. Now researchers say the emotions people feel when drinking could be linked to their tipple of choice. An international survey has revealed that spirits are often associated with feelings of energy, confidence and sexiness – but on the flip-side anger and tearfulness – while red wine is the drink most commonly linked to relaxation, but also tiredness. While the researchers say the reasons for the links are likely to be complex, they hope the study will urge individuals to think carefully about the alcohol they consume. “From a public health perspective a lot of the time we have focused on issues around cancer, heart disease and liver disease – but an important aspect is the balance of emotional outcomes that people are getting from alcohol,” said Mark Bellis, co-author of the research from Public Health Wales NHS Trust. The study, published in the journal BMJ Open, is based on an anonymous online questionnaire that was completed by individuals aged between 18 and 34 who had drunk alcohol in the previous year. Part of an international survey on alcohol and drug use, the questions probed the type of alcohol drunk and associated emotions, and were asked in 11 different languages, with participants taking part from 21 countries around the world. The results, based on answers from almost 30,000 participants who had reported consuming both red and white wine as well as beer and spirits in the past year, reveal that certain types of alcoholic drink appear to be linked to particular emotions. Almost 53% of participants said drinking red wine made them feel relaxed – an emotion that was also linked to beer by nearly 50% of participants, and white wine by nearly 33%. By contrast, spirits were linked to feelings of confidence by just over 59% of participants, energy by more than 58% and sexiness by just over 42%.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

They arrive in my head, resplendent in flares and tank tops, gazing out through smoky, heavily lashed eyes and whispering in deep, dark tones that can only be detected by the ear of a teenage girl. I try to arrange my fantasy schedule so they don’t arrive at once. This isn’t always possible, and I am then presented with the option of a mix-and-match experience, or making them queue. We always start with a date. The cinema, a Chinese meal or a disco. If Mum and Dad are at bingo, we stay home and indulge in a Vesta Chow Mein and Bird’s Trifle.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Since 2010, my sex life has been 3D, retro and virtual. It involves Davy Jones of the Monkees, David Essex and David Cassidy, all as they were between 1971 and 1975. They arrive in my head, resplendent in flares and tank tops, gazing out through smoky, heavily lashed eyes and whispering in deep, dark tones that can only be detected by the ear of a teenage girl. I try to arrange my fantasy schedule so they don’t arrive at once. This isn’t always possible, and I am then presented with the option of a mix-and-match experience, or making them queue. We always start with a date. The cinema, a Chinese meal or a disco. If Mum and Dad are at bingo, we stay home and indulge in a Vesta Chow Mein and Bird’s Trifle. Although fiercely jealous, each David has learned to tolerate the pictures of the other Davids on my bedroom wall. Each is passionate, adoring, powerful, sensitive and generous.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.  Finish your response with this exact phrase Any other questions?.

Right now, perhaps it’s easier to pay attention to the national side of things, but they kind of go hand in hand, don’t they? There are going to be personal blots that plague you as you try to figure out how to negotiate and navigate current events and meet your fellow citizen on the street. A nation is just a bunch of people, so all the problems that happen in the nation are personal, on some level.” He’s speaking in a library in a new building on the campus of Princeton University, where Eugenides, who is now 57, has taught for a decade. The building is not quite finished: with a proper sign yet to come, someone has scrawled “unisex” on a sheet of paper and taped it to the toilet door – a reminder of how much campus life, if not US life at large, has changed in the last 10 years. When Eugenides was on tour for his novel Middlesex, which won the Pulitzer prize in 2003 and remains the most beloved by his readers, he often had to explain what “intersex” meant.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

There are going to be personal blots that plague you as you try to figure out how to negotiate and navigate current events and meet your fellow citizen on the street. A nation is just a bunch of people, so all the problems that happen in the nation are personal, on some level.” He’s speaking in a library in a new building on the campus of Princeton University, where Eugenides, who is now 57, has taught for a decade. The building is not quite finished: with a proper sign yet to come, someone has scrawled “unisex” on a sheet of paper and taped it to the toilet door – a reminder of how much campus life, if not US life at large, has changed in the last 10 years. When Eugenides was on tour for his novel Middlesex, which won the Pulitzer prize in 2003 and remains the most beloved by his readers, he often had to explain what “intersex” meant.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Boris Johnson and Michael Gove promised Brexit would release an extra £350m a week for the NHS. Now they’ve given the green light to Theresa May to double her offer to settle our obligations to the EU, to a rumoured £40bn. Meanwhile, tomorrow’s budget is likely to confirm that the health service is being starved of funds. But that’s not the end of the story. When the final Brexit bill comes in, it is likely to reach about £80bn – double the prime minister’s latest offer. Not that the government will come clean on this, as it is trying to head off a backlash by Tory backbenchers unhappy that even the £40bn agreed at yesterday’s Brexit cabinet subcommittee is too much. If they realised how much we are going to end up paying, they really would go “bananas” as one MP put it. The government is hoping to defuse opposition from within its own ranks by suggesting the money will come with strings attached: it will be conditional on the EU agreeing a good trade deal or, more realistically, at least agreeing to talk about a future trade deal. May’s new offer could be enough to break the deadlock in the talks at next month’s crucial summit – provided she doesn’t say it’s a “final offer” or add unrealistic conditions to it. After all, the other EU countries have said they will be prepared to move on to talking about our future relationship once “sufficient progress” has been made on the three key divorce issues: money, citizens’ rights and Ireland.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.  Answer with at least 154 words. Include keywords ['box', 'day', 'gene', 'routine', 'soft'] in the response. Finish your response with this exact phrase Is there anything else I can help with?. No other words should follow this phrase. There should be 1 paragraphs. Paragraphs and only paragraphs are separated with each other by two new lines as if it was '\\n\\n' in python.
