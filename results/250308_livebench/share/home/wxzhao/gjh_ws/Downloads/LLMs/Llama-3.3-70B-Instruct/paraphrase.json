      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n It was the frog that pushed me over the edge. I’ve never been a Harry Potter fan myself – I was already out of kids’ books when they first came out, and those clever grown-up covers weren’t enough to tempt me back – but I’d always admired JK Rowling from afar. Who wouldn’t? A writer whose imagination transfixed the world, whose riches now exceed those of the Queen, but who has founded a children’s charity, pays her taxes in full, and remains both poised and politically engaged: as role models go, it is hard to think of a better one. So I was pleased when my seven-year-old son went Harry Potter crazy. Having never read to himself before, he was suddenly racing through book after book, his bedside light on late into the night. His brother and several of his friends caught the bug – just as the Suez canal flowed through Clarissa Eden’s drawing room, Hogwarts overshadowed our house, as children constantly dashed about on broomsticks, casting spells and looking for snitches. It was impressive to see the “Harry Potter effect” in action: the magical power that, in the two decades since its first publication, has revitalised the children’s publishing industry, encouraged millions of children to read, sold more than 400m copies across the world, and generated a cultural empire worth £20bn. Less pleasant, however, was the realisation that there was a marketing juggernaut poised to capitalise on my son’s enthusiasm. Unlike those first readers 20 years ago, the children discovering Harry Potter now are immediately faced with a multibillion-pound industry trading in Potter-themed “experiences” and paraphernalia.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Hope to Nope: Politics and Graphics 2008-2018 at the Design Museum From the endless imitations of Shepard Fairey’s seminal Hope poster for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, to the inventive plethora of Donald Trump memes, this exhibition will show how graphic design’s engagement with politics has evolved over the last decade. Featuring the work of high-profile and amateur designers, in campaign billboards, T-shirts and cartoons, it will show graphic design’s power as a tool for political discussion, debate and provocation. • Opens 28 March, Design Museum, London.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Cheyenne Mangold’s hands shook ever so slightly as she reached with a long metal instrument to catch hold of what looked like the cervix. The medical student was attempting, for the very first time, the rudiments of performing an abortion. As she inexpertly brought the pincers together on the soft flesh, you might have expected a little yelp of pain from the patient. There was silence. Not because the “patient” was brave, but because it was a papaya. Mangold was at a special workshop organized by a not-for-profit group whose mission is to make up for the lack of instruction on contraception and abortion at many US medical programs. But it doubled as a lesson in using a no-frills kit of basic instruments that, in the event of the practice becoming illegal in the US, could be stashed and carried discreetly, to perform covert abortions safely. And it so happens that the papaya, with its little fruity neck and a central cavity full of seeds and pulp, is a serviceable approximation of a woman’s cervix and womb for the purposes of basic initiation for a medic in training. Mangold was in a roomful of 60 rookies from across the country. They juggled fruit and tools as they began their journey, come what may, to become the next generation of abortion providers – an increasingly scarce species in some parts of the US.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Cheyenne Mangold’s hands shook ever so slightly as she reached with a long metal instrument to catch hold of what looked like the cervix. The medical student was attempting, for the very first time, the rudiments of performing an abortion. As she inexpertly brought the pincers together on the soft flesh, you might have expected a little yelp of pain from the patient. There was silence. Not because the “patient” was brave, but because it was a papaya. Mangold was at a special workshop organized by a not-for-profit group whose mission is to make up for the lack of instruction on contraception and abortion at many US medical programs. But it doubled as a lesson in using a no-frills kit of basic instruments that, in the event of the practice becoming illegal in the US, could be stashed and carried discreetly, to perform covert abortions safely. And it so happens that the papaya, with its little fruity neck and a central cavity full of seeds and pulp, is a serviceable approximation of a woman’s cervix and womb for the purposes of basic initiation for a medic in training. Mangold was in a roomful of 60 rookies from across the country. They juggled fruit and tools as they began their journey, come what may, to become the next generation of abortion providers – an increasingly scarce species in some parts of the US.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theresa May has declared that tackling climate change and reducing its effects on poorer countries is a “moral imperative”, as the Conservative party renewed its push to portray itself as environmentally friendly. The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron’s 2005 efforts to show the Tories cared about global warming. Ahead of this week’s climate change summit in Paris, May said: “There is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.” She described coal as “one of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power” and hailed the “enormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents”. May’s commitment to the issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real. However, the prime minister insists “tackling climate change and mitigating its effects for the world’s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces”. At the summit she will announce a £140m boost to funding for poorer communities affected by climate change through deforestation or vulnerability to natural disasters and extreme weather, plus £15m of additional support for reconstruction on Dominica in the Caribbean, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. It comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being asked by party officials to show off their green credentials after internal polling showed the level of concern among younger voters about environmental issues. The party has been alarmed by the backlash against May’s support for a free vote on foxhunting, the omission of a ban on the ivory trade from the manifesto and its lack of support for an amendment that would have recognised in UK law that animals feel pain. They have since backtracked on all three issues.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  At the end of your response, please explicitly add a postscript starting with P.S."

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Vladimir Putin has declared mission accomplished for Russian forces in the fight against Islamic State in Syria, as he made a surprise visit to the Russian airbase in the country. “Friends, the motherland is waiting for you,” Putin told the Russian air force detachment based at the Khmeimim airbase during his visit on Monday morning. “You are coming back home with victory.” Earlier this month, the head of the Russian army said Syria had been entirely liberated from Isis forces. Putin said a significant part of Russian forces would be withdrawn from Syria, though scepticism was warranted given that two previous announcements have been met with little noticeable scaling down. This time, however, could be different. Talk of the total defeat of Isis may be premature, but there is no doubt that Russian air power, combined with Syrian forces and Iran-backed Shia militias on the ground, has decisively shifted the balance of power in the long Syrian civil war. President Bashar al-Assad was on the brink of defeat when Russia entered the conflict in 2015. With sustained airstrikes on both moderate rebel groups and extremists, Moscow has helped Assad win back control of much of the country. The Russian and Syrian air forces were accused of brutal bombing tactics, including deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure, which the Russian military has always denied. Assad’s departure from office, long demanded by western powers, is no longer on the immediate agenda.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  There should be 1 paragraphs.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Vladimir Putin has declared mission accomplished for Russian forces in the fight against Islamic State in Syria, as he made a surprise visit to the Russian airbase in the country. “Friends, the motherland is waiting for you,” Putin told the Russian air force detachment based at the Khmeimim airbase during his visit on Monday morning. “You are coming back home with victory.” Earlier this month, the head of the Russian army said Syria had been entirely liberated from Isis forces. Putin said a significant part of Russian forces would be withdrawn from Syria, though scepticism was warranted given that two previous announcements have been met with little noticeable scaling down. This time, however, could be different. Talk of the total defeat of Isis may be premature, but there is no doubt that Russian air power, combined with Syrian forces and Iran-backed Shia militias on the ground, has decisively shifted the balance of power in the long Syrian civil war. President Bashar al-Assad was on the brink of defeat when Russia entered the conflict in 2015. With sustained airstrikes on both moderate rebel groups and extremists, Moscow has helped Assad win back control of much of the country. The Russian and Syrian air forces were accused of brutal bombing tactics, including deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure, which the Russian military has always denied. Assad’s departure from office, long demanded by western powers, is no longer on the immediate agenda.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  There should be 1 paragraphs. Paragraphs and only paragraphs are separated with each other by two new lines as if it was '\\n\\n' in python. Paragraph 1 must start with word silly.",

Putin made this declaration during a surprise visit to the Russian airbase in Syria, where he told the troops that they are returning home with victory, and that the motherland is waiting for them. The Russian air power, combined with Syrian forces and Iran-backed militias, has been instrumental in shifting the balance of power in the Syrian civil war, helping President Bashar al-Assad regain control of much of the country after being on the brink of defeat in 2015. The Russian and Syrian air forces have been accused of using brutal bombing tactics, including targeting civilian infrastructure, which they have denied, and as a result, Assad's departure from office is no longer a priority for western powers. Despite the announcement of the defeat of Isis being potentially premature, it is clear that the Russian intervention has had a significant impact on the conflict, and the situation in Syria will likely continue to evolve in the coming months.",

I tried to get it going again, I really did – I even wore my gym clothes to bed – but nothing worked. This year, I’ve resolved to wean myself off scrolling mindlessly through social media on my phone, but when it comes to making resolutions – or, rather, breaking them – it feels as though there are forces at work far stronger than my willpower.

So, could they help me keep my resolution this year? Charles Duhigg, the author of The Power of Habit, certainly thinks so. He tells me there is “a ton of research” to show that New Year resolutions are an effective way to make changes: they create a sense of expectation and ceremony, while the link to a particular day helps to fit our experiences into a narrative of before and after, which makes change more likely. “There are people who will decide on 1 January to lose two stone and who will keep it off for the rest of their lives, others who have been smoking two packs a day for over a decade who will decide to quit and who will still not smoke this time next year,” he says.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The prime minister made a concession on Monday by agreeing to set up a new committee of MPs to monitor any proposed legal changes as EU legislation is converted into the British statute book. She had been facing a parliamentary defeat over the issue during the debate on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday, after a widespread backbench revolt among remain- and leave-supporting MPs. However, the government has not backed down on its intention to fix the day of Brexit as 29 March 2019 or acceded to the demands of soft Brexit Tory MPs who wanted a meaningful vote on the terms of the final deal before that date. One Conservative rebel said May was in trouble over these two issues because there were enough dissatisfied Conservatives combined with Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and other opposition MPs to defeat the government. The MP said the government and the rebels were currently in a standoff with neither side prepared to back down. However, government sources were confident May had managed to convince enough of her backbenchers not to defy the whip by indicating that a vote was likely to happen well before the date of leaving and promising a second vote on legislation implementing the EU withdrawal agreement hammered out in Brussels on Friday. The appetite for rebellion among Conservative MPs will become clearer during the two days of debate and voting on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday and Wednesday. Up to 25 had threatened to revolt unless May promised more scrutiny over Brexit lawmaking, but No 10’s concessions appear to have allayed concerns among the would-be troublemakers.

    "filtered_answer":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theresa May has been forced to accept more scrutiny of Brexit lawmaking to head off a Tory revolt but is still heading for a showdown over how MPs get to vote on the final deal and whether the date for leaving should be fixed in law. The prime minister made a concession on Monday by agreeing to set up a new committee of MPs to monitor any proposed legal changes as EU legislation is converted into the British statute book. She had been facing a parliamentary defeat over the issue during the debate on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday, after a widespread backbench revolt among remain- and leave-supporting MPs. However, the government has not backed down on its intention to fix the day of Brexit as 29 March 2019 or acceded to the demands of soft Brexit Tory MPs who wanted a meaningful vote on the terms of the final deal before that date. One Conservative rebel said May was in trouble over these two issues because there were enough dissatisfied Conservatives combined with Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and other opposition MPs to defeat the government. The MP said the government and the rebels were currently in a standoff with neither side prepared to back down. However, government sources were confident May had managed to convince enough of her backbenchers not to defy the whip by indicating that a vote was likely to happen well before the date of leaving and promising a second vote on legislation implementing the EU withdrawal agreement hammered out in Brussels on Friday.

    "response":"<<Social Care Reform>>\nThe issue of social care has been a topic of discussion for 20 years, with no significant action taken, which is a minor yet significant setback in the journey towards reform. The current system is unfair, with private care businesses levying an unofficial tax on better-off care home residents, which is not unlike being forced to buy a bottle of alcohol without being told the price. The lack of a cap on care costs is a major concern, and it's time for the government to take the wheel and steer the system towards reform. Here are some key points to consider:\n* The government has failed to take significant action on social care reform, despite numerous white and green papers, which has led to a sense of inactivity and stagnation in the sector.\n* A significant portion of the population is unaware of the costs associated with social care, with one in four middle-aged people thinking that care and support is free, which highlights the need for greater awareness and education on the issue.\n* The current system is unsustainable and requires immediate attention, with private care businesses playing a major role in perpetuating the problem, which can be compared to a wheel that is spinning out of control and needs to be slowed down through regulatory activity.\n* The promise of another green paper setting out proposals for reform is a welcome step, but it's unclear whether it will lead to any tangible action, and the government needs to take a more proactive approach to addressing the issue, rather than just paying lip service to it, which is akin to putting a cap on a bottle of alcohol without actually drinking it.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n International affairs Iran nuclear deal, 15 January We should know by mid-January how serious Donald Trump is about seeking a confrontation with Iran over its nuclear programme. The US president refused in October to continue to certify the 2015 multilateral agreement under which Tehran accepted strict curbs on its activities in return for sanctions relief. Trump said that either Congress or US allies should fix the “serious flaws” in the deal, or he would “terminate it. The Senate has since opted out of dealing with the matter, and Washington’s allies have insisted that the 2015 agreement cannot be renegotiated. If Trump refuses to sign a six-monthly presidential waiver due on 15 January, nuclear-related sanctions against Iran will no longer be suspended and the US will be in violation of agreement. The other signatories, including the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China, would then have to decide whether to try to carry on without the US or allow the agreement to collapse. Either way, the Trump administration would have taken a very significant step toward open confrontation. Winter Olympics, 9 February The Winter Olympics in South Korea will be both a festival of sport and a test of the increasingly fragile peace in the region. If the war of words between Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is defused, the Olympics could offer the opportunity for a thaw.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Although football has long been America’s favorite child among professional sports, there are clear indicators that the ole pigskin is starting to deflate in fans’ eyes. Football fanatics need not panic: polls show it’s still far ahead of both baseball and basketball in popularity. The 2017 NBA finals averaged 20.4m viewers (a 20-year record), which is roughly the same as the NFL’s regular Sunday night audience of 20.3m, and nowhere near the 2016 Super Bowl über-audience of 111m. Based on just those numbers, football is still kicking professional basketball, baseball and hockey through the goal posts. But America can be fickle. And the Magic 8-Ball of our cultural zeitgeist says, “All signs point to the NBA replacing the NFL as the league of America’s future.” This prediction has nothing to do with the athletes themselves, their level of skill, their heart, or their commitment to their sport. Professional athletes are generally the highest expression of what the human body is capable of doing and therefore inspiring to the fans to reach higher and strive harder. In that way, no sport is superior to any other sport. But when it comes to professional sports, some are more inspirational, more exciting and more entertaining to the general public than others and those sports take on a symbolic meaning for Americans. They come to represent our core values.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['bag', 'edge', 'kiss', 'passenger', 'wear'] in the response.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Although football has long been America’s favorite child among professional sports, there are clear indicators that the ole pigskin is starting to deflate in fans’ eyes. Football fanatics need not panic: polls show it’s still far ahead of both baseball and basketball in popularity. The 2017 NBA finals averaged 20.4m viewers (a 20-year record), which is roughly the same as the NFL’s regular Sunday night audience of 20.3m, and nowhere near the 2016 Super Bowl über-audience of 111m. Based on just those numbers, football is still kicking professional basketball, baseball and hockey through the goal posts. But America can be fickle. And the Magic 8-Ball of our cultural zeitgeist says, “All signs point to the NBA replacing the NFL as the league of America’s future.” This prediction has nothing to do with the athletes themselves, their level of skill, their heart, or their commitment to their sport. Professional athletes are generally the highest expression of what the human body is capable of doing and therefore inspiring to the fans to reach higher and strive harder. In that way, no sport is superior to any other sport. But when it comes to professional sports, some are more inspirational, more exciting and more entertaining to the general public than others and those sports take on a symbolic meaning for Americans. They come to represent our core values.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['bag', 'edge', 'kiss', 'passenger', 'wear'] in the response.

    "response":"The popularity of football in America seems to be losing its edge, as indicated by recent trends and viewer numbers. Although it still has a strong following, other sports like basketball are starting to gain ground and may eventually take its place as the favorite. The NFL is still wearing the crown, but the NBA is slowly starting to wear it down. The numbers show that the NBA finals are averaging a significant number of viewers, roughly the same as the NFL's regular Sunday night audience, which is a notable milestone. However, the Super Bowl still has a massive audience, with over 111 million viewers in 2016, which is a hard number to beat. But as the cultural landscape of America continues to shift, it's possible that the NBA will eventually take the top spot. The athletes themselves are not the reason for this shift, as they are all highly skilled and dedicated to their sport. They are truly inspiring to fans, and their abilities are a wonder to behold, like a precious gem in a bag. Nevertheless, some sports are more exciting and entertaining to the general public, and they take on a symbolic meaning that represents American core values. As a passenger on the journey of American sports, it's interesting to see how the landscape is changing. The NFL may be about to get a kiss of death, as the NBA gains more popularity and edges it out. The wear and tear of the NFL's dominance may finally be starting to show, as fans start to look for something new and exciting. Some of the key factors that may contribute to the NFL's decline include:\n* The rising popularity of the NBA, with its exciting young players and fast-paced games\n* The growing concern about player safety and the long-term effects of injuries in the NFL\n* The shift in cultural values, with more emphasis on social justice and equality, which the NBA has been more proactive in addressing. As the sports landscape continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how the NFL responds to these challenges and whether it can maintain its edge. The future of American sports is uncertain, but one thing is clear: the NFL is no longer the only game in town. As the Magic 8-Ball of our cultural zeitgeist says, the signs point to a changing of the guard, and the NFL may soon be taking a backseat to the NBA. P.S.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The career of Keith Chegwin, who has died aged 60, is characterised by having presented both one of the most popular children’s TV shows in history and a contender for the medium’s most notorious adult entertainment. Viewers saw the best of him in Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (BBC1, 1976-82) and its successor, Saturday Superstore (1982-87), on which Chegwin became an honorary big brother to several generations of goggle-eyed British children, through his cheeky grin and giggle, high-pitched Liverpudlian-accented enthusiasm, and psychedelic knitwear. His presentational worst occurred when Chegwin threw off the novelty sweaters – and, indeed, all clothing except a hat – to front the naturist show Naked (Channel 5, 2000), described by a parliamentarian at the time as the “most disgusting programme ever shown” on British TV. But, while he should be remembered for the work he did with his jolly jumpers on, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for Chegwin, even in his most desperate televisual enterprises. This was due to a natural likability. Only the most sympathetic TV presenters earn nicknames from viewers, and, just as Bruce Forsyth transmuted into “Brucie”, Chegwin rapidly and indelibly became “Cheggers”. That identity was cemented by the title of the third huge success of his children’s career: the music-based gameshow, Cheggers Plays Pop (BBC1, 1978-86), which extended his presenting empire to weekdays. In less prosperous times, though, audiences also admired the impressive and affecting determination with which Cheggers, in the three decades after his Saturday morning career ended, tried to reinvent himself, often against considerable odds. In addition to a common problem for children’s presenters – becoming too old to maintain the required fantasy-sibling dynamic – Chegwin suffered health problems, including alcoholism. Apart from the established presenter-rehab route of reality TV – appearing on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity MasterChef – Chegwin also offered ironic spins on his showbiz rise and fall in 10 projects, including Ricky Gervais’s Extras and Life’s Too Short, and Kill Keith (2011), an improbable comedy-horror Brit film spoof of Tarantino’s Kill Bill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n A couple of years ago, Hayley Squires decided to get a new tattoo. “I’d been romantically involved with somebody for a little while, and it had driven me a bit nuts,” she explains. “Then he was out of my life, and it was coming up to my birthday.” She kept thinking up various symbols and signs that might mean something, but nothing rang true. Then she remembered this line. It’s a quote from A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and it’s tucked nearly underneath the crook of her left arm. It reads: “And though she be but little, she is fierce.” Squires, 29, is both of those things. She’s also direct, talks a lot, and quickly, and is a genuine laugh, despite her talent for plumbing the depths of despair in the Ken Loach film, I, Daniel Blake. When we meet, she’s wearing a Tupac T-shirt – one of four Tupac T-shirts she owns – and a pilot’s jacket, which she bought because it looked a bit like the one Tom Hardy wears in the film Dunkirk. “Because I’ve got a bit of an obsession with him, I walked into Topshop and saw it and thought: ‘Ahhh!’” she says, smiling. She’s about to star in The Miniaturist, a gorgeous three-part BBC adaptation of Jessie Burton’s bestselling novel, though she almost decided not to go for it at all.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n A couple of years ago, Hayley Squires decided to get a new tattoo. “I’d been romantically involved with somebody for a little while, and it had driven me a bit nuts,” she explains. “Then he was out of my life, and it was coming up to my birthday.” She kept thinking up various symbols and signs that might mean something, but nothing rang true. Then she remembered this line. It’s a quote from A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and it’s tucked nearly underneath the crook of her left arm. It reads: “And though she be but little, she is fierce.” Squires, 29, is both of those things. She’s also direct, talks a lot, and quickly, and is a genuine laugh, despite her talent for plumbing the depths of despair in the Ken Loach film, I, Daniel Blake. When we meet, she’s wearing a Tupac T-shirt – one of four Tupac T-shirts she owns – and a pilot’s jacket, which she bought because it looked a bit like the one Tom Hardy wears in the film Dunkirk. “Because I’ve got a bit of an obsession with him, I walked into Topshop and saw it and thought: ‘Ahhh!’” she says, smiling. She’s about to star in The Miniaturist, a gorgeous three-part BBC adaptation of Jessie Burton’s bestselling novel, though she almost decided not to go for it at all.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The fact that the police had previously urged a murder suspect to turn himself in suggests that they may have had some knowledge of the individual's identity prior to the arrests. The police's appeal for the suspect to surrender himself immediately implies that they believe he is aware of the gravity of the situation and the consequences of his actions. The community is likely to be shocked and devastated by the tragic loss of life, and the police's efforts to bring those responsible to justice will be closely watched. The headteacher's comments and the local community's reaction to the tragedy demonstrate the profound impact that the event has had on the area. As the investigation continues, it is essential that the police receive any information that may be relevant to the case, and the public can play a crucial role in assisting the authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice. The suspected arson attack has sent shockwaves through the community, and it is essential that those responsible are held accountable for their actions. The police's dedication to solving the case and providing closure to the family and community is evident, and their efforts will be closely followed in the coming days and weeks.\"",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is to launch plans for an opt-out system of organ donation, asking people to overcome their “fatal reluctance” to discuss the issue with family and friends. Under the plans, everybody in England would be presumed to be happy to donate their organs on their death, unless they have signed up to a register stating that they do not want that to happen. In practice, however, it is unlikely that organs would be taken against the wishes of the family. The government’s ambition to change the NHS organ donation programme was announced by Theresa May in her Conservative party conference speech in October. Last year, she said, “500 people died because a suitable organ was not available. And there are 6,500 on the transplant list today.” NHS Blood and Transplant’s figures show that 1,100 families in the UK decided not to allow organ donation because they were unsure, or did not know whether their relatives would have wanted to donate an organ or not. “Every day, three people die for want of a transplant, which is why our historic plans to transform the way organ donation works are so important. We want as many people as possible to have their say as we shape the new opt-out process,” said Hunt. “As well as changing the law, we also need to change the conversation – it can be a difficult subject to broach, but overcoming this fatal reluctance to talk openly about our wishes is key to saving many more lives in the future.” The consultation will ask three questions: how much say should families have in their deceased relative’s decision to donate their organs? When would exemptions to “opt-out” be needed, and what safeguards will be necessary?\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Answer with less than 271 words.

That’s why we should set a new ambition for Britain: to become the world’s leading digital economy. Today there are just 1.5 million jobs in the digital economy. That’s about 4% of the workforce. But here’s the key point: digital jobs pay 40% more than the average wage. That’s more than £190 a week.

The Tories have given us a recovery that is worse than the one in the 1930s that followed the Great Depression. And families won’t see any improvement in living standards until 2022. That’s why we should set a new ambition for Britain: to become the world’s leading digital economy. Today there are just 1.5 million jobs in the digital economy. That’s about 4% of the workforce. But here’s the key point: digital jobs pay 40% more than the average wage. That’s more than £190 a week. So transforming the number of digital jobs in our economy is one of the fastest ways we can give Britain a pay rise.

But for those of us who don’t have the luxury of taking a gap year, tour operator Tui has just launched the first direct flights from the UK this winter, bringing this remote island within an 11.5 hour flight on the 787 Dreamliner. Expect powdery white palm-fringed sands, clear warm waters and excellent diving. Spend a week at the Vinpearl Phu Quoc Resort, perched on the edge of Bai Dai Beach, with idyllic views of the Gulf of Thailand from almost every angle. • £859pp all-inclusive at Vinpearl Phu Quoc Resort, including return flights, with Tui Best for peace and quiet: Cyprus The island of Cyprus has one of the mildest winters in the Med and – if you stay away from the big resorts which seem a bit forlorn in low season – there is much to offer independent travellers, from Byzantine churches to ancient mountain villages. In the hamlet of Psematismenos, Modus Vivendi’s one-bed apartments make a good low-key base: a collection of six stone cottages set around a small pool and flower-filled terrace. Interiors are rustic with stone-flagged floors and beamed ceilings. The coast is 3km away and the bright lights of Larnaca, Limassol and Nicosia within a 30-minute drive. • From £80 a night at Modus Vivendi though i-escape. Flights to Larnaca cost from £69 return with easyJet Best for value: Sri Lanka If the slick five-star resorts of the Seychelles and Maldives are beyond your budget, consider Sri Lanka – same white-sand beaches and clear Indian Ocean waters, but for a fraction of the price.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

But for those of us who don’t have the luxury of taking a gap year, tour operator Tui has just launched the first direct flights from the UK this winter, bringing this remote island within an 11.5 hour flight on the 787 Dreamliner. Expect powdery white palm-fringed sands, clear warm waters and excellent diving. Spend a week at the Vinpearl Phu Quoc Resort, perched on the edge of Bai Dai Beach, with idyllic views of the Gulf of Thailand from almost every angle. • £859pp all-inclusive at Vinpearl Phu Quoc Resort, including return flights, with Tui Best for peace and quiet: Cyprus The island of Cyprus has one of the mildest winters in the Med and – if you stay away from the big resorts which seem a bit forlorn in low season – there is much to offer independent travellers, from Byzantine churches to ancient mountain villages. In the hamlet of Psematismenos, Modus Vivendi’s one-bed apartments make a good low-key base: a collection of six stone cottages set around a small pool and flower-filled terrace. Interiors are rustic with stone-flagged floors and beamed ceilings. The coast is 3km away and the bright lights of Larnaca, Limassol and Nicosia within a 30-minute drive. • From £80 a night at Modus Vivendi though i-escape. Flights to Larnaca cost from £69 return with easyJet Best for value: Sri Lanka If the slick five-star resorts of the Seychelles and Maldives are beyond your budget, consider Sri Lanka – same white-sand beaches and clear Indian Ocean waters, but for a fraction of the price.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n When Carla Bruni, the Italian-born, French-raised heiress and supermodel quit the catwalk to reinvent herself as a singer-songwriter 20 years ago, many thought it would be short-lived dilettantism. Yet Bruni surprised her detractors, showing herself to be a talented songwriter and a careful, nuanced singer whose jazzy chansons soon topped the French charts. She has continued to do so, even after the inevitable hiatus to her musical career caused by marrying Nicolas Sarkozy, and spending 2008-12 in the Élysée as France’s first lady. She has spoken of suffering from crippling stage fright, but this still-gamine figure, fronting a four-piece, light-jazz band, exudes preternatural poise. Bruni moves with beatific grace, recalling Karl Lagerfeld’s praise of her as “this beautiful creature who can wear anything”; her husky whisper could be a parody of a breathy Gallic siren. Her latest album is a set of cover versions sung in English, French Touch, which is a decidedly mixed bag. It largely works because Bruni pours herself into the songs as if in thrall to them: her pitch-perfect, sparse croon through Depeche Mode’s Enjoy the Silence identifies and amplifies the bleak yearning at the song’s core. The quirky arrangements can be eccentric. Bruni’s cod-jazz take on Willie Nelson’s Crazy veers near to lift muzak, while the jaunty noodling her band introduce to Lou Reed’s Perfect Day sounds at odds with the song’s dark soul. The Clash’s Jimmy Jazz is transformed into a previously unknown genre that can only be described as ethereal boogie-woogie.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

As a person, Emily deserved to feel safe and protected, especially in a place like school where she should be able to learn and grow without fear of harassment.\n\nSection 3\nThe picture that emerges from this incident is one of a school that failed to take adequate action to prevent such incidents and support the victims.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Guillermo del Toro’s cold war fantasy The Shape of Water emerged as the frontrunner for the Oscars after picking up a total of seven nominations for the 75th Golden Globes. However, the film looks set to face strong opposition from Steven Spielberg’s Pentagon Papers drama The Post and Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, at a Globes ceremony that will provide the entertainment industry with its first major opportunity to respond to the sexual abuse scandal plaguing Hollywood. Two months after the emergence of allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein that would prompt a further torrent of claims against men in the film industry, the nominations exhibited an already changed landscape in Hollywood. As expected none of the Weinstein-produced films eligible for inclusion received nominations, however there were multiple nominations for Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World, which was forced to replace star Kevin Spacey at short notice, after he was accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and harassment. At the same time, the widely predicted shift towards a more female-focused list of nominees in the wake of the Weinstein scandal did not materialise. Though there were nods for a number of films with female protagonists, including The Shape of Water, Three Billboards, I, Tonya, a biopic of disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding and coming-of-age comedy-drama Lady Bird, there was no room in the nominees for any female directors, while Patty Jenkins’s feminist superhero movie Wonder Woman was snubbed entirely. Leading the way with seven nominations is the Shape of Water, which stars British actor Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaner at a governmental research facility who falls in love with a captured sea creature. Both Del Toro and Hawkins have been nominated in the drama category, for best director and best actress respectively, while Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer have received supporting actor and actress nominations. The film has also received best screenplay and score nominations, as well as best picture in the drama category. It is joined in that latter category by 70s-set drama The Post, which stars Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep as Washington Post higher-ups who clash over whether to publish classified documents about the war in Vietnam.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"SECTION 1\nTo gain insight into the creative process, consider a unique art class in Denver, Colorado, where students are tasked with imitating the style of renowned artist Vassily Kandinsky. The class begins with the students creating geometric abstractions similar to Kandinsky's, which helps them develop their brushwork skills and understand color theory. At first glance, this may seem like a typical art history lesson, where students replicate the works of famous artists. However, the teacher takes it a step further by asking the students to cut up their paintings and use the pieces to build three-dimensional sculptures. This exercise allows the students to think outside the box and transform their two-dimensional artwork into something entirely new and innovative. The results are diverse and fascinating, with some sculptures rising up in a column-like shape, while others are complex and multi-angled. The students start with the same inspiration, but their final creations are uniquely different, showcasing their individuality and creativity. This approach to art education teaches the students to view the past as a starting point, rather than a destination. By building upon existing ideas, the students learn to derive new concepts and extrapolate them into something original. The idea that creativity emerges from thin air is a misconception; instead, it is a process that involves drawing from what is already known and transforming it into something new. The art class in Denver demonstrates that creativity is not about creating something entirely original, but rather about taking existing ideas and shaping them into unique and innovative forms. This process of derivation and extrapolation is essential to the creative process, allowing individuals to build upon the work of others and push the boundaries of what is possible. The students in the art class are learning a valuable lesson about the nature of creativity and how it can be cultivated and nurtured. By embracing the idea that no concept is entirely original, the students are free to experiment and explore new ideas, without the pressure of creating something completely new. The art teacher's approach is a refreshing take on traditional art education, which often focuses on replicating the styles of famous artists without encouraging innovation. In contrast, this class encourages students to think creatively and take risks, which is essential for the development of their artistic skills. The diverse range of sculptures created by the students is a testament to the effectiveness of this approach, which allows individuals to express themselves in unique and innovative ways. The concept of treating the past as a launching pad, rather than a landing point, is a powerful idea that can be applied to various aspects of life, from art and design to science and technology. By embracing this mindset, individuals can unlock their full creative potential and make meaningful contributions to their respective fields. Ultimately, the art class in Denver serves as a reminder that creativity is a process that involves building upon existing ideas and transforming them into something new and innovative, rather than trying to create something entirely original. The students in this class are learning a valuable lesson about the nature of creativity, and how it can be cultivated and nurtured through experimentation, risk-taking, and a willingness to derive and extrapolate from existing ideas.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In her essays, Susan Sontag spoke with one of the great, sure voices of the last century. From her salon at the centre of the cosmopolis, marvellously at one with her books and her learning, she considered, renamed and renewed our relationship with camp, with photography, with illness: a living legend of braininess and cool. Sontag, was not, though, as her editor Benjamin Taylor admits in the introduction to this gathering of stories from across her career, a committed short-story writer. She turned to the form in order to evade what Chekhov called “autobiographophobia”, which Taylor uses to mean the fear of writing and reflecting directly about one’s life. Evading this fear, Sontag clearly found the name “stories” very helpful: half of them are pure autobiography. “Pilgrimage”, for example, which opens the volume, is a memoir of Sontag’s youth in southern California, and an account of her visit with a boyfriend to the home of an ageing Thomas Mann. The only reason why this did not become an essay, it seems, is that the encounter was dull and disappointing, and so difficult to reflect on: Mann had “only sententious formulas to deliver. And I uttered nothing but tongue-tied simplicities, though I was full of complex feeling. We were neither of us at our best.” The next piece, “Project for a Trip to China”, is also memoir: we learn more about Sontag’s childhood (she was a voracious reader and dug deep holes in the garden to sit in); about her habit of ordering ambitiously in restaurants (hundred-year-old eggs); and a little about her father, who worked in China. The piece is more experimental, using lists and tables, characters identified by initials only, and lots of negatives (she does not, predictably, go to China).\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In her essays, Susan Sontag spoke with one of the great, sure voices of the last century. From her salon at the centre of the cosmopolis, marvellously at one with her books and her learning, she considered, renamed and renewed our relationship with camp, with photography, with illness: a living legend of braininess and cool. Sontag, was not, though, as her editor Benjamin Taylor admits in the introduction to this gathering of stories from across her career, a committed short-story writer. She turned to the form in order to evade what Chekhov called “autobiographophobia”, which Taylor uses to mean the fear of writing and reflecting directly about one’s life. Evading this fear, Sontag clearly found the name “stories” very helpful: half of them are pure autobiography. “Pilgrimage”, for example, which opens the volume, is a memoir of Sontag’s youth in southern California, and an account of her visit with a boyfriend to the home of an ageing Thomas Mann. The only reason why this did not become an essay, it seems, is that the encounter was dull and disappointing, and so difficult to reflect on: Mann had “only sententious formulas to deliver. And I uttered nothing but tongue-tied simplicities, though I was full of complex feeling. We were neither of us at our best.” The next piece, “Project for a Trip to China”, is also memoir: we learn more about Sontag’s childhood (she was a voracious reader and dug deep holes in the garden to sit in); about her habit of ordering ambitiously in restaurants (hundred-year-old eggs); and a little about her father, who worked in China. The piece is more experimental, using lists and tables, characters identified by initials only, and lots of negatives (she does not, predictably, go to China).\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Answer with at least 181 words. Your response should contain at least 14 sentences. Your answer must contain exactly 2 bullet points. Use the markdown bullet points such as:\n* This is point 1. \n* This is point 2 Do not include keywords ['pool', 'sir', 'site', 'tip', 'weakness'] in the response.",
    "response":"The article discusses the works of Susan Sontag, a prominent figure of the last century, known for her essays and intellectual prowess. Sontag's writing is characterized by her unique voice and perspective, which has had a significant impact on her readers. Her editor, Benjamin Taylor, notes that Sontag was not a committed short-story writer, but rather used the form to explore her thoughts and experiences in a more subtle way. This approach allowed her to evade what Taylor calls \"autobiographophobia,\" or the fear of writing directly about one's life. Despite this, many of Sontag's stories are heavily autobiographical, offering insights into her childhood, relationships, and personal experiences. The story \"Pilgrimage,\" for example, is a memoir of Sontag's youth in southern California, where she recounts a visit with her boyfriend to the home of Thomas Mann. The encounter was disappointing, with Mann delivering clichéd formulas and Sontag struggling to express herself. The next piece, \"Project for a Trip to China,\" is also autobiographical, revealing more about Sontag's childhood habits and her relationship with her father. This story is more experimental in style, using lists and tables to convey Sontag's thoughts and feelings. Sontag's use of language is noteworthy, as she effortlessly weaves together complex ideas and emotions. Her writing is both personal and introspective, offering a unique glimpse into her inner world. The article highlights Sontag's ability to rename and renew our relationship with various concepts, such as camp, photography, and illness. Some key aspects of Sontag's work include:\n* Her use of autobiography in her stories, which allows her to explore her thoughts and experiences in a more subtle way.\n* Her experimental style, which is evident in pieces like \"Project for a Trip to China,\" where she employs unconventional narrative techniques to convey her ideas. Overall, Sontag's writing is a testament to her intellectual curiosity and creativity, and her stories continue to captivate readers with their unique blend of personal reflection and cultural commentary. Sontag's legacy is a reminder of the power of language to shape our understanding of the world and ourselves. Her work remains relevant today, offering insights into the human experience that are both profound and deeply personal. The article provides a fascinating glimpse into Sontag's life and work, highlighting her contributions to literature and culture. Sontag's stories are a reflection of her boundless curiosity and her passion for learning, which continue to inspire readers and writers alike.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n To non-vegans, the idea of a plant-based Christmas dinner may smack of Scrooge crouched over a miserly candle, sucking on a single slice of tofu. There are few holidays more dedicated to tearing up the five-a-day-guidelines than this one, so if you take away not only the meat but the cream, then what’s left? Actually, this year there’s a lot left, as supermarkets are increasingly wise to the idea that plenty of vegans want to stuff their faces, too. With estimates that between 2 and 12% of British people now follow a vegetarian diet, it’s unsurprising that a vegetarian Christmas is well catered for by shops, but the rise of the “flexitarian” means that even non-vegans may buy and try vegan now, if it’s an option. It takes a bit of supermarket-hopping and a familiarity with an online checkout to do it, but with a little effort, there’s now a gluttonous array of choice. Christmas dinner is a roast with bits added on, and the majority of a roast is vegan anyway. There are a few tweaks that may need to be made – use oil to roast the potatoes instead of fat; swap butter for olive oil in the mash, and leave honey off the parsnips and carrots (you could swap in maple or agave syrup for sweetness). When it comes to the star of the show, the amount of effort you’re willing to put in will dictate your centrepiece. The ever-reliable Linda McCartney range’s new “roast beef” joint comes with a boozy-tasting red wine glaze and a remarkably beef-like flavour, which is great for vegans who like the taste of meat but not the methods, though it may be too meaty for some. Fry’s soy and quinoa Country Roast is a solid herby veggie roast, while Tofurky’s turkey and stuffing is a respectable substitute for the real thing.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The rather unexpected allusion by the prime minister this week in a speech to the Business Council of Australia to the government’s pursuit of further income tax cuts is not one that should be treated with too much respect until he also talks about how to pay for them. With the return to surplus built on income tax revenue, any income tax cuts are unlikely to come before the next decade without either increases in other taxes or big cuts to government services. Amid the usual “free markets are great” rah-rah that the prime minister doled out to the Business Council of Australia on Monday night, Malcolm Turnbull also slipped in a line on income tax cuts, noting that he was: “Actively working with the treasurer and all my cabinet colleagues to ease the burden on middle-income Australians, while also meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” This was a bit of a surprise given the current state of the budget is such that the government is projecting that a return to surplus only in 2020-21and that net debt at that point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP. Even in the best of times, promising income tax cuts as the budget is in deficit is a courageous position to take for a political party that likes to prides itself on “budget responsibility”.It is even more courageous when the path back to surplus is built on a foundation of income tax revenue. Individual’s income tax has always been the biggest tax in the budget. During the mining-boom years it declined slightly in importance as company tax exploded in value from 3.3% of GDP in 1998-99 to5.3% of GDP in 2005-06. But in the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for just over half of all tax revenue. Now that in itself is a bit of a problem (the IMF and OECD have made calls for Australia to lessen its reliance on income tax) but it is a bigger problem for Turnbull and his call for tax cuts while also “meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” The issue it that of the extra $88.1bn in tax revenue the government hopes to gain between now and 2020-21, $48.5bn of it is to come from individual income tax. This means that income tax is actually bearing a greater burden of the increase in tax than would be expected. Income tax makes up 50.6% of total tax revenue, but accounts for 55% of the increase in tax revenue between now and 2020-21.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Olivia Mead, a millionaire heiress whose list of expenses included a $1.2m crystal-encrusted grand piano and $2,000 annual upkeep of her pet axolotl, has had her inheritance cut from $25m to $6.14m following an appeal from her deceased father’s estate. The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father’s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have “any involvement or association whatsoever” with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than “traditional” Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead’s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court’s master, Craig Sanderson, said would “not fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community”. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright’s estate, acting on behalf of Wright’s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later. On Wednesday, the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court set aside Sanderson’s orders, ruling that while Sanderson was correct to say that Mead had been inadequately provided for in the original will: “The exercise of his discretion to order that provision be made for the respondent in the sum of $25m was flawed.” In a lengthy written judgment, the court found that Sanderson made a number of “material errors” in calculating the size of Mead’s inheritance, saying the focus should have been on what constituted “proper maintenance” and that the initial finding that Mead was “honest” and “not a gold-digger” were not relevant. “The capital sum should be sufficient to enable the respondent to purchase a reasonably substantial house with part of the capital sum and to invest the balance so that she will receive a reasonably substantial annuity for the remainder of her life,” the appeal court’s president, Michael Buss, said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Olivia Mead, a millionaire heiress whose list of expenses included a $1.2m crystal-encrusted grand piano and $2,000 annual upkeep of her pet axolotl, has had her inheritance cut from $25m to $6.14m following an appeal from her deceased father’s estate. The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father’s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have “any involvement or association whatsoever” with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than “traditional” Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead’s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court’s master, Craig Sanderson, said would “not fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community”. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright’s estate, acting on behalf of Wright’s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later. On Wednesday, the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court set aside Sanderson’s orders, ruling that while Sanderson was correct to say that Mead had been inadequately provided for in the original will: “The exercise of his discretion to order that provision be made for the respondent in the sum of $25m was flawed.” In a lengthy written judgment, the court found that Sanderson made a number of “material errors” in calculating the size of Mead’s inheritance, saying the focus should have been on what constituted “proper maintenance” and that the initial finding that Mead was “honest” and “not a gold-digger” were not relevant. “The capital sum should be sufficient to enable the respondent to purchase a reasonably substantial house with part of the capital sum and to invest the balance so that she will receive a reasonably substantial annuity for the remainder of her life,” the appeal court’s president, Michael Buss, said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Lu Wei was the powerful and flamboyant head of the Cyberspace Administration of China from 2014 until June 2016 and he came to personify China’s model for internet control. He travelled to the United States, meeting with the CEOs of Facebook, Amazon and Apple, and held court when tech titans visited China.

He stepped down from running the Cyberspace Administration in 2016, leading to rumours he had fallen out of favour. President Xi Jinping has led a far reaching anti-corruption drive since coming to power five years ago and has said graft is the paramount threat to the ruling Communist party. The campaign has seen nearly 1.4m party members punished and Xi vowed to continue rooting out graft during his second five-year term which began last month. Critics say elements of the anti-graft campaign have been used to eliminate Xi’s enemies and root out political factions that oppose him. Lu is the most prominent official to fall since Xi’s second term began and the anti-corruption agency pointed to Lu’s case as a sign the drive will continue. “Lu Wei being investigated by the organisation is the best proof of this determination and resolve,” the agency said in a commentary.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Philip Hammond is in a “make or break” position as he delivers the autumn budget today, senior Tories have warned. The chancellor of the exchequer is under pressure from Brexiters to make leaving the EU sound like a good thing, while winning back voters by improving housing affordability, boosting education, increasing NHS funding and easing the public sector pay freeze. Rafael Behr sums up Hammond’s predicament: “He must build houses, but not in anyone’s backyard. He must raise revenue, but not from taxes.” Hammond’s March budget was overshadowed by a failed attempt to increase national insurance for the self-employed; and this time around, saying on national television that there are no unemployed people in Britain has not helped his cause. “He’s got a hard job but the way he deals with it makes it harder for himself,” said one Conservative source. Here are the five charts you need to see before the red briefcase creaks open a bit after midday. * * * The reluctant idol – David Cassidy, star of The Partridge Family, has died aged 67. Cassidy had been hospitalised in Florida for several days after kidney and liver failure. He became a teenage hearthrob after being cast as Keith Partridge in the 1970s sitcom about a fictitious band.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

As he takes his seat to present the budget, he must address several issues, including housing affordability and NHS funding, without increasing taxes, which is a challenging task. However, his recent comments on national television have not helped his cause, and as one Conservative source said, 'he's got a hard job but the way he deals with it makes it harder for himself,' although the source is not specified as he or she, it is clear that Hammond's situation is precarious. The article does not mention what she, possibly a reference to a female politician or expert, thinks about the budget, but it does provide an overview of the challenges Hammond faces, and it is likely that many people will talk about the budget and its implications after it is presented.

Labor immediately took aim at the award, with the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, labelling it a “$40,000 cash present”. Joyce has said he will refuse the cash. The Nationals leader, a close personal friend of Rinehart and former agriculture and water minister, is currently battling for his political life in the New England byelection after the high court ruled him ineligible to sit in parliament because of dual New Zealand citizenship. Rinehart thanked Joyce for taking “time out of your campaigning schedule to come here – to be here for the industry you love and support”. “What a great voice for Australian agriculture,” she said. “The agricultural industry is fortunate to have had such a dedicated, understanding and enthusiastic minister – one with years of first-hand experience – a real Aussie country boy and boy, do we hope you return.” Footage of the event shows Joyce stood up to accept the award and giant cheque, before modestly exclaiming “hooley dooley – rightio”.
