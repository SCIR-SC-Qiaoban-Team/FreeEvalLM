    "ground_truth":"The first king of Aurea leads a futile attack on a dragon residing in his realm. All the king's men are killed, leaving the king at the Dragon's mercy. Centuries later, Elodie, the adolescent daughter of Lord Bayford, receives a proposal from Queen Isabelle of Aurea to marry her son, Prince Henry. On her father's urging, Elodie agrees to the marriage so her bride price can help their impoverished people. Upon arriving in Aurea, Elodie and Henry are initially uninterested in each other, but begin to bond as they share a desire to travel. Elodie's stepmother, Lady Bayford, becomes suspicious of the motives of Queen Isabelle, leading her to futilely implore Elodie to end the engagement. After the wedding, Elodie and Henry take part in an ancient ritual in the mountains, supposedly to celebrate their union. Isabelle describes the pact between the first king and the Dragon, where he had to sacrifice his three daughters to ensure peace between his people and the dragon. Following a ceremony where their palms are cut and held together, Henry carries Elodie across the narrow path over the Dragon's lair, then at Isabelle's behest throws her down the chasm. Recovering from the fall, Elodie realizes that she is the actual sacrifice. She escapes the Dragon after it burns her leg, and discovers an illuminated cave filled with glowing silk worms, which she collects as a light source. Elodie reaches a chamber with the note 'Safe Here She Cannot Reach', the names of past victims, and a map carved into the wall. In Elodie's sleep, the worms heal the burn on her leg. Elodie follows the map to a dead end at a high vertical drop on the mountainside. She discovers the remains of dead dragon hatchlings, explaining the reason for the royal sacrifices. A rescue party led by Lord Bayford arrives. The Dragon kills them, including Lord Bayford, but the distraction allows Elodie to escape the mountain. She takes one of the rescue party's horses and hides under a rock as the Dragon burns the surrounding area in an unsuccessful pursuit. Alerted by the conflagration that Elodie's sacrifice has failed, Isabelle resorts to kidnapping Elodie's younger sister Floria as a replacement. After learning this from a desperate Lady Bayford, Elodie returns to the mountain to rescue Floria, who the dragon has left alive as bait. Elodie creates a diversion to reach Floria. Telling her sister to hide, she confronts the Dragon and tries to convince her that they were deceived by the Aureans: by joining their cut hands at the wedding, the blood of the brides and the Aurean royals mingled, making the Dragon think of the princesses as being of Aurean descent. Refusing to believe Elodie, the Dragon states that the first king's assault was unprovoked, and then attacks her, but Elodie tricks her into burning herself. With the Dragon at her mercy, she convinces the Dragon of the truth and heals both of them with the glowing worms. Elodie then interrupts the wedding of another sacrifice at the palace, exposing the Aurean royal family's treachery. Elodie advises the new bride and her family to flee, and the Dragon burns the palace with all the Aurean royals and nobles inside. Days later, Elodie, Floria, and Lady Bayford sail home, loaded with supplies and accompanied by the Dragon.",

Amidst these challenges, a family gathering brings news that her brother-in-law, Ray Hawthorne, an ambitious assistant district attorney, is set to prosecute a high-profile murder case against Zyair Malloy, a charismatic local artist. Despite the familial discord, Mea becomes intrigued when Zyair, proclaiming his innocence, approaches her to represent him, claiming that Ray has a personal grudge against him. As Mea delves deeper into the case, she encounters a tangle of evidence that seems compelling at first glance but shows inconsistencies under scrutiny.

    "ground_truth":"Charlotte, a rebellious 12-year-old girl, lives in a dilapidated apartment building in New York City with her parents, overworked stepfather Ethan and mother Heather. A fan of comic books, Charlotte regularly bonds with Ethan over the creation of her character 'Fang Girl', but feels constantly isolated due to the presence of her infant half-brother Liam One night, Charlotte stumbles upon a tiny spider hatched from a strange, glowing object that crash-lands in her great-aunt's apartment. Intrigued, Charlotte decides to keep the spider as a pet, naming it Sting. As Charlotte cares for Sting, the spider begins to grow at an alarming rate. She initially keeps its size a secret, but as it becomes more difficult to hide, Ethan and some of the apartment tenants start to notice strange occurrences around the building. Sting's growing size and insatiable appetite soon lead to the death of pets and residents, which worsen after Charlotte leaves it in the care of her neighbor Eric. Following an argument with Ethan after Eric exposes Sting's presence, Charlotte's relationship with him becomes strained over the fact that her biological father has been neglecting her. Sometime after, Sting attacks and kidnaps both Ethan and Heather along Liam, forcing a distressed Charlotte to intervene. The tension escalates when Sting, now a gigantic, traps several residents in the building using mimicked sounds to lure prey. Charlotte learns the spider's weakness from her grandmother and goes on a hunt for her now missing family. As Charlotte saves Ethan, they face numerous obstacles, including Sting's intelligence and adaptability. During a showdown in the building's basement, Sting attacks the group until Charlotte manages to lure it into a trap with the help of Ethan. Using a trash compression device, they finally destroy Sting, but not without sustaining significant losses. With Charlotte's family safe, they do not realize that Sting has laid several eggs, with one beginning to hatch.",

With Charlotte's family safe, they do not realize that Sting has laid several eggs, with one beginning to hatch. Sting's growing size and insatiable appetite soon lead to the death of pets and residents, which worsen after Charlotte leaves it in the care of her neighbor Eric. As Charlotte saves Ethan, they face numerous obstacles, including Sting's intelligence and adaptability. A fan of comic books, Charlotte regularly bonds with Ethan over the creation of her character 'Fang Girl', but feels constantly isolated due to the presence of her infant half-brother Liam One night, Charlotte stumbles upon a tiny spider hatched from a strange, glowing object that crash-lands in her great-aunt's apartment. She initially keeps its size a secret, but as it becomes more difficult to hide, Ethan and some of the apartment tenants start to notice strange occurrences around the building. Charlotte, a rebellious 12-year-old girl, lives in a dilapidated apartment building in New York City with her parents, overworked stepfather Ethan and mother Heather. The tension escalates when Sting, now a gigantic, traps several residents in the building using mimicked sounds to lure prey. Using a trash compression device, they finally destroy Sting, but not without sustaining significant losses. Sometime after, Sting attacks and kidnaps both Ethan and Heather along Liam, forcing a distressed Charlotte to intervene. Charlotte learns the spider's weakness from her grandmother and goes on a hunt for her now missing family. Following an argument with Ethan after Eric exposes Sting's presence, Charlotte's relationship with him becomes strained over the fact that her biological father has been neglecting her."

    "ground_truth":"In late 1941, during World War II the United Kingdom is struggling to halt Nazi Germany's attempts to take over Europe, with London regularly suffering bombing runs at the hands of the Luftwaffe. With their supply and aid ships constantly sunk by German submarines, Brigadier Colin Gubbins, with the indirect backing of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, prepares to initiate Operation Postmaster, an off the books black-ops sabotage mission intended to disrupt the Nazis' U-boat resupply operation on the Spanish-controlled island Fernando Po. While SOE agents Marjorie Stewart and Richard Heron depart by train, Gubbins enlists Gus March-Phillips to assemble a ground team to destroy the Italian supply ship Duchessa d'Aosta and two tugboats attached to it. Using the neutral Swedish fishing trawler Maid of Honor, Gus and his allies, Graham Hayes, Freddy Alvarez, and Danish naval officer Anders Lassen (the only non-British subject to be awarded the Victoria Cross), begin the slow sail to Fernando Po. Upon discovering that SOE saboteur Geoffrey Appleyard, whom Gubbins had sent ahead on the assumption that Gus would show interest in wanting him on the team, was captured by Gestapo agents, they divert course to a Nazi-controlled section of the Canary Islands for a rescue mission. Meanwhile, arriving early on Fernando Po, Marjorie and Heron use the latter's 'illegal' gambling hall to recruit backup for Gus' team while Marjorie seduces Heinrich Luhr, the SS commander in charge. Upon learning that the Duchessa intends to depart three days ahead of schedule, Gus has his crew sail through a British naval blockade of Nazi-occupied West Africa despite knowing they'll be arrested should their unauthorized mission be discovered. On the night of the intended raid, Marjorie and Heron learn that Luhr has had the Duchessa's hull reinforced despite the Italian attache's reservations. Barely warned of this in time, Gus and Appleyard decide that their best course of action is to hijack the ships and use them as a bartering chip after a mole in Gubbins' staff reveals the mission to senior command. Although Luhr eventually catches on when Marjorie's act begins to 'slip', the raid is ultimately successful, and Marjorie shoots Luhr in the head. Delivering the boats to a British fleet outside Lagos, the team is nonetheless arrested. While waiting to be court-martialed, they are saved and recruited by Churchill as part of his 'Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare', as their actions have not only severely damaged the Nazis' naval strength, but also have allowed the United States, who recently entered the war following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, to join the European theatre. A montage of details before the end credits reveal the post operation activities of several protagonists: Gus became a war hero and would helm several similar raids during the war before marrying Marjorie at the start of her acting career; Appleyard would receive several commendations for his role in the mission, much to the king's amusement; Hayes would go on to become a highly accomplished spy notable for surviving a year of Nazi torture without breaking; Lassen would go on to take part in raids outside the group until his death in 1945; Ian Fleming, who had been part of Gubbins' inner circle during this time, would use Operation Postmaster as the inspirational basis for his James Bond novels.",

    "ground_truth":"Years after a global catastrophe, Australia is a radioactive wasteland and the Green Place of Many Mothers is one of the last remaining areas with fresh water and agriculture. Raiders discover the Green Place while two kids, Furiosa and Valkyrie, are picking peaches. Furiosa attempts to sabotage their motorbikes, but the raiders capture her as a prize for their leader, warlord Dementus of the Biker Horde. Furiosa's mother Mary pursues them to the Horde's camp, killing all but one raider. The last raider delivers Furiosa to Dementus, but Furiosa mortally wounds him before he can reveal the Green Place's location. Mary sneaks into the camp and rescues Furiosa; the Horde gives chase. Mary stays back to buy Furiosa time to escape and gives her a peach pit to remember her by, but Furiosa returns to her mother anyway. Dementus forces Furiosa to watch her mother's crucifixion. Haunted by the death of his family, he adopts Furiosa as his daughter, hoping that she will lead him to the Green Place. Furiosa tattoos a star chart to the Green Place on her left arm to find her way home. After receiving a tip from a stranded soldier, Dementus and the Biker Horde besiege the Citadel, another Wasteland settlement with fresh water and agriculture. They are repelled by the War Boys, the fanatical army of Citadel warlord Immortan Joe. Dementus changes course, using a Trojan Horse strategy to capture Gastown, an oil refinery that supplies the Citadel with gasoline. At peace negotiations, Joe agrees to recognize Dementus's authority over Gastown and increase its supplies of food and water in exchange for the Horde's physician and Furiosa. At the Citadel, Immortan Joe imprisons Furiosa in the vault with his stable of 'wives'. After Joe's son Rictus shows an attraction to her, she devises a plan to escape. One night, Rictus breaks Furiosa out of the vault to make sexual advances toward her; using a wig made from her own hair, she slips from his grasp and disappears. Disguised as a mute teenage boy, Furiosa works her way up the ranks of Immortan Joe's men for over a decade and helps build the 'War Rig', a heavily-armed supply tanker that can withstand raider attacks in the lawless Wasteland. During one such attack, the Rig's crew are wiped out, leaving its commander, Praetorian Jack, and Furiosa as the only survivors. Furiosa attempts to carjack the Rig and return to the Green Place, but Jack easily thwarts her. However, Jack recognizes her potential and offers to train her to escape the Citadel if she helps him rebuild his crew. Furiosa becomes Jack's second-in-command and is promoted to Praetorian; the two bond and resolve to escape together one day. Immortan Joe decides to attack Gastown, as Dementus's mismanagement has led the facility to near-ruin. He orders Furiosa and Jack to collect weapons and ammunition from the Bullet Farm, an allied mining facility. However, Dementus, having preemptively attacked and captured the Bullet Farm, ambushes the War Rig on arrival; Furiosa and Jack barely escape, and Furiosa's left arm is severely injured. Dementus eventually chases them down and tortures Jack to death. Furiosa escapes her chains by severing her own injured arm, sacrificing her star map to escape; a loner watches Furiosa return to the Citadel. Upon arrival, Furiosa helps Joe plan a 40-day war, during which most of Dementus's horde is killed. Having lost her path home, Furiosa shaves her head again, replaces her arm with a mechanical prosthetic, and pursues Dementus by herself as he flees with the remnants of his horde. After an extended chase, she captures him in the desert. Dementus taunts her, saying revenge will not make her whole. In a voiceover, the potentially unreliable narrator claims that Furiosa imprisoned Dementus at the Citadel and used his living body as fertilizer to grow a peach tree from her mother's seed. For her services, Immortan Joe promotes Furiosa to 'Imperator' and gives her command of a new War Rig. She eventually meets Joe's five remaining wives in the vault where Joe once held her prisoner. In the final scene, the 'Five Wives' hide in Furiosa's War Rig the night before another supply run.",

Disguised as a mute teenage boy, Furiosa works her way up the ranks of Immortan Joe's men for over a decade and helps build the 'War Rig', a heavily-armed supply tanker that can withstand raider attacks in the lawless Wasteland. Furiosa's mother Mary pursues them to the Horde's camp, killing all but one raider. However, Jack recognizes her potential and offers to train her to escape the Citadel if she helps him rebuild his crew. In a voiceover, the potentially unreliable narrator claims that Furiosa imprisoned Dementus at the Citadel and used his living body as fertilizer to grow a peach tree from her mother's seed. He orders Furiosa and Jack to collect weapons and ammunition from the Bullet Farm, an allied mining facility. During one such attack, the Rig's crew are wiped out, leaving its commander, Praetorian Jack, and Furiosa as the only survivors. Haunted by the death of his family, he adopts Furiosa as his daughter, hoping that she will lead him to the Green Place. One night, Rictus breaks Furiosa out of the vault to make sexual advances toward her; using a wig made from her own hair, she slips from his grasp and disappears. In the final scene, the 'Five Wives' hide in Furiosa's War Rig the night before another supply run. Upon arrival, Furiosa helps Joe plan a 40-day war, during which most of Dementus's horde is killed. At the Citadel, Immortan Joe imprisons Furiosa in the vault with his stable of 'wives'. For her services, Immortan Joe promotes Furiosa to 'Imperator' and gives her command of a new War Rig. The last raider delivers Furiosa to Dementus, but Furiosa mortally wounds him before he can reveal the Green Place's location. Furiosa becomes Jack's second-in-command and is promoted to Praetorian; the two bond and resolve to escape together one day. Dementus changes course, using a Trojan Horse strategy to capture Gastown, an oil refinery that supplies the Citadel with gasoline. At peace negotiations, Joe agrees to recognize Dementus's authority over Gastown and increase its supplies of food and water in exchange for the Horde's physician and Furiosa. Immortan Joe decides to attack Gastown, as Dementus's mismanagement has led the facility to near-ruin. Dementus forces Furiosa to watch her mother's crucifixion. Years after a global catastrophe, Australia is a radioactive wasteland and the Green Place of Many Mothers is one of the last remaining areas with fresh water and agriculture. However, Dementus, having preemptively attacked and captured the Bullet Farm, ambushes the War Rig on arrival; Furiosa and Jack barely escape, and Furiosa's left arm is severely injured. After an extended chase, she captures him in the desert. Dementus eventually chases them down and tortures Jack to death. Dementus taunts her, saying revenge will not make her whole. Furiosa attempts to sabotage their motorbikes, but the raiders capture her as a prize for their leader, warlord Dementus of the Biker Horde. After receiving a tip from a stranded soldier, Dementus and the Biker Horde besiege the Citadel, another Wasteland settlement with fresh water and agriculture. They are repelled by the War Boys, the fanatical army of Citadel warlord Immortan Joe. She eventually meets Joe's five remaining wives in the vault where Joe once held her prisoner. Raiders discover the Green Place while two kids, Furiosa and Valkyrie, are picking peaches. Furiosa attempts to carjack the Rig and return to the Green Place, but Jack easily thwarts her. Mary stays back to buy Furiosa time to escape and gives her a peach pit to remember her by, but Furiosa returns to her mother anyway. Having lost her path home, Furiosa shaves her head again, replaces her arm with a mechanical prosthetic, and pursues Dementus by herself as he flees with the remnants of his horde. Furiosa escapes her chains by severing her own injured arm, sacrificing her star map to escape; a loner watches Furiosa return to the Citadel. Furiosa tattoos a star chart to the Green Place on her left arm to find her way home. Mary sneaks into the camp and rescues Furiosa; the Horde gives chase.",

    "ground_truth":"Following the destruction of House Atreides by House Harkonnen, Princess Irulan, the daughter of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, secretly journals her distaste over how her father betrayed the Atreides. On Arrakis, Stilgar's Fremen troops, including Paul Atreides and his pregnant Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Jessica, overcome a Harkonnen patrol. When Jessica and Paul reach Sietch Tabr, some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the 'Outer World' will bring prosperity to Arrakis. Stilgar tells Jessica that Sietch Tabr's Reverend Mother is dying and that Jessica must succeed her by drinking the Water of Life—a poison fatal for males and untrained women. Jessica transmutes and survives the poison, inheriting the memories of all the past Reverend Mothers. The liquid also prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her; they agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy. Chani and her friend, Shishakli, correctly believe the prophecy was fabricated to manipulate the Fremen, but begins to respect Paul after he declares that he only intends to fight alongside the Fremen, not to rule them. Paul and Chani fall in love as Paul immerses himself in Fremen culture: learning their language, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, riding a sandworm, and raiding Harkonnen spice operations. Paul adopts the Fremen names 'Usul' and 'Muad'Dib'. Due to the continuing spice raids, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen replaces his nephew, Rabban, as Arrakis's ruler with his more cunning yet psychotic younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha. Lady Margot Fenring, a Bene Gesserit, is sent to evaluate Feyd-Rautha as a prospective Kwisatz Haderach and secure his genetic lineage. Jessica travels south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists who believe most strongly in the prophecy. Paul remains in the north, fearful that his visions of an apocalyptic holy war will come to pass if he goes south as a messiah. During another raid on a spice harvester, Paul reunites with Gurney Halleck, who leads Paul to the hidden atomic stockpile of House Atreides. Feyd-Rautha unleashes a devastating attack on the northern Fremen, destroying Sietch Tabr, killing Shishakli, and forcing Paul and the survivors to journey south. Upon arrival, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a coma. This angers Chani, but she is compelled by Jessica to mix her tears with the liquid, which awakens him. Now possessing clairvoyance across space and time, Paul sees an adult Alia on water-filled Arrakis. He also sees a singular path to victory among all possible futures, and that Jessica is the Baron's daughter. Paul meets with the southern Fremen war council, galvanizing the crowd by demonstrating his ability to discern their deepest thoughts. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib and sends a challenge to Shaddam, who arrives on Arrakis with Irulan and the Sardaukar. As Shaddam chastises the Harkonnens for their failures, the Fremen launch an offensive, using atomics and sandworms to overpower the Sardaukar.

    "ground_truth":"A civil war has engulfed the United States, fought between the federal government led by a third-term president and secessionist movements. Despite the president claiming that victory is close at hand, it is considered only a matter of time before the 'Western Forces' (WF), led by Texas and California, reach Washington, D.C. After surviving a suicide bombing in New York City, veteran war photographer Lee Smith and journalist colleague Joel meet with their mentor Sammy to share their plan to interview the isolated president. While trying to dissuade them from heading to the capital, Sammy joins them so that he can reach the frontline at Charlottesville, Virginia. The next morning, Lee finds that Joel has allowed a young aspiring photojournalist who Lee encountered at the bombing, Jessie Cullen, to join them. After departing the city, the group stops at a gas station that is protected by armed men. Jessie explores a nearby car wash, where she finds the men torturing two alleged looters. One of the guards follows Jessie, but Lee defuses the situation by taking a photo of the man posing with his victims. Later, Jessie berates herself for being too scared to take photos. When Lee has her shoot a downed helicopter, Jessie asks if Lee would photograph Jessie being killed, to which Lee responds, 'What do you think?'. Following an overnight stop near ongoing fighting, the group documents combat the next day as secessionist militiamen assault a loyalist-held building. Lee recognizes Jessie's potential as a war-photographer and begins to mentor her, while Jessie photographs the militia executing loyalist prisoners. Continuing, the group spends the night at a refugee camp before passing through a small town where, under watchful guard, residents attempt to live in blissful ignorance. Lee and Jessie grow closer, trying on clothes at a shop. They are caught in a sniper battle amid the remains of a Christmas fair. Nearby snipers mock Joel's questioning what side they are on, instead displaying a cynical kill-or-be-killed attitude. Jessie's nerve and photography skills improve as she becomes desensitized to violence. While driving, the four encounter two Hongkonger reporters who they know, Tony and Bohai. Tony and Jessie switch vehicles before Bohai drives ahead with Jessie in his car. The others catch up to find the pair held at gunpoint by unknown uniformed militia who are burying bodies in a mass grave. Against Sammy’s objection, the other three attempt to negotiate their release, but the leader of the militia executes both Bohai and Tony for not being American. The others are saved by Sammy after he rams the group's truck into members of the militia, but he is mortally wounded during the escape and dies. Traumatized, the remaining three arrive at the Charlottesville WF base. Joel learns from Lee's British reporter friend Anya that most remaining loyalists have surrendered, leaving D.C. undefended beside fanatical remnants of the armed forces and Secret Service. Joel drunkenly lashes out at what he views as Sammy's pointless death; Lee tells Jessie that Sammy died while doing what he wanted. Lee deletes a photo that she took of his body. The trio embeds itself with the WF as they assault Washington, D.C., where Jessie repeatedly exposes herself during fighting to capture photographs, while Lee struggles with combat fatigue.

Jessie unemotionally continues into the Oval Office, watching soldiers drag the president from under his desk and prepare to execute him summarily.

    "ground_truth":"Colt Seavers, a Hollywood stunt performer, works as the stunt double for famous action star Tom Ryder. However, he is severely injured during a stunt gone wrong and he abandons his career and his girlfriend Jody Moreno, a camerawoman. Eighteen months later, Colt, now a valet for a small Mexican restaurant, is contacted by Gail Meyer, Tom's film producer. She tells him that Jody is directing her first film, a science fiction epic titled Metalstorm, and wants Colt to join the production in Sydney. After arriving on set, Colt learns that Jody never asked for him and is still angry about their breakup, with the film being a less-than-subtle attempt at airing her grievances at Colt. Gail reveals that Tom has disappeared after getting into trouble with drug dealers, and she wants Colt to find him before his absence causes the already overbudget film's cancelation. Not wanting Jody's directorial debut ruined, Colt starts to track down Tom. He first goes to Tom's apartment where he is ‘attacked’ by Tom's girlfriend Iggy. She gives him a lead, so he visits a nightclub, where he meets drug dealer Doone, who tricks Colt into drinking a cocktail laced with hallucinogenic drugs. After getting into a fight with the drug dealer's goons, he visits Tom's hotel room where he finds a dead body in a bathtub full of ice. When Colt returns with the police, he finds the body has disappeared. Meanwhile, as production of Metalstorm continues, Colt and Jody begin to rekindle their relationship until Gail abruptly informs him that he must return to the United States. Instead, he continues looking for Tom by tracking down his PA Alma Milan. They are both attacked by people looking for a phone belonging to Tom in Alma's possession. Colt defeats them after an extended chase through Sydney, involving a rubbish truck. He and his longtime friend Dan Tucker, the stunt coordinator on Metalstorm, unlock the phone at Tom's apartment. They discover a video of an intoxicated Tom accidentally killing his previous stuntman Henry Herrera. The henchmen attack Colt and Dan, destroying the phone with shotgun pellets. Dan escapes, but Colt is captured and brought face-to-face with Tom, who has been hiding out on a yacht on Gail's instructions. He reveals that Gail is framing Colt for the crime using deepfake technology to replace Tom's face with Colt's on the incriminating video. Tom also reveals that he orchestrated both Colt's and Henry's ‘accidents’ over his resentment of them thinking he's cowardly for not wanting to do his own stunts. Henry's body is discovered and the doctored video is released on news media, while Gail tries to convince Jody that Colt is guilty. Colt escapes and is presumed dead after a boat chase, though he swims to safety. The next day, Tom arrives at the Metalstorm set with his goons and the production continues. Colt secretly returns to the set and convinces Jody of his innocence. Together, they trick Tom into participating in a stunt sequence and into confessing while he is wired with a lav mike. The rest of the crew, led by Dan, hold off his goons. Gail steals the recording at gunpoint and tries to escape in a helicopter with Tom, but Jody helps Colt leap onto the helicopter in mid-air. He retrieves the recording and falls onto a crash mat prepared by Dan, while the helicopter crashes with Gail and Tom in it. Metalstorm's trailer premieres at San Diego Comic-Con, with Jason Momoa replacing Tom as the lead, and the film eventually becomes a box-office hit. Colt gets exonerated, and he and Jody get back together. In a flashback, prop crew members dressed as police surround Gail and Tom, prompting Tom to run towards stunt pyrotechnics while trying to phone his agent, accidentally blowing himself up.",

When Colt arrives on set, he learns that Jody never asked for him and is still angry about their breakup, with the film being a less-than-subtle attempt at airing her grievances at Colt. Tom also reveals that he orchestrated both Colt's and Henry's “accidents” over his resentment of them thinking he's cowardly for not wanting to do his own stunts. Gail steals the recording at gunpoint and tries to escape in a helicopter with Tom, but Jody helps Colt leap onto the helicopter in mid-air.\n\nIn a crash mat prepared by Dan, Colt retrieves the recording. The henchmen attack Colt and Dan, destroying the phone with shotgun pellets. Metalstorm's trailer premieres at San Diego Comic-Con, with Jason Momoa replacing Tom as the lead, and the film eventually becomes a box-office hit. Colt secretly returns to the set and convinces Jody of his innocence. When Colt returns with the police, he finds the body has disappeared. Together, they trick Tom into participating in a stunt sequence and into confessing while he is wired with a lav mike. He and his longtime friend Dan Tucker, the stunt coordinator on Metalstorm, unlock the phone at Tom's apartment.",

    "ground_truth":"Captain Eddie ‘Reaper’ Grimm, a US Air Force drone pilot, supported by Staff Sergeant Nia Branson, provides air support from a Reaper to a US Army Delta Force team sent to rescue a CIA spy in the southern Philippines. After a firefight breaks out against the Abu Sayyaf, Sergeant JJ ‘Playboy’ Kinney – a young Air Force TACP officer attached to the drone team as its JTAC – is seemingly the only survivor and is directed to an extraction point, relying only on the Reaper's remote air support. Once Kinney arrives, he is intercepted by the Abu Sayyaf, depleting the ammunition of Grimm's drone (consisting of AGM-114 Hellfire and BLU-118 rockets) and forcing the endangered extraction helicopter to leave. Trying to reach another extraction point, Kinney falls down a hill and loses his rifle, runs out of ammunition for his pistol, and then gets captured. One of his squad mates, Master Sergeant John ‘Sugar’ Sweet, turns out to be alive and rescues Kinney, while telling him Sergeant Bishop was taken prisoner in Abu Sayyaf's base in a series of caves, at their initial mission location. Using Sweet's radio, Kinney contacts Grimm, who schedules three bombings to hit the base, each 15 minutes apart, before Grimm and Branson are forced by their superiors to take a leave for having exceeded their shift. Kinney and Sweet raid one of Sayyaf's facilities before being captured and taken to their prison. Sweet is executed right as the first superficial bombing hits, and Kinney is taken to be tortured, where the rebel leader does not believe his warning about the upcoming bombings. When the bombs hit, Kinney survives due to having been dunked in a water tub, while his captors are caught in the flames. Kinney grabs a machete and kills the surviving leader, taking his satellite phone and calling Nellis Air Force Base for Grimm to call off the third bombing, before the battery runs out. The base crew, distracted by a March Madness game, dismisses Kinney's call and redirects him to Grimm's private phone. Grimm does not answer, being in a call with his very pregnant wife while grocery shopping, so Kinney leaves a voice mail, and leaves seeking the other prisoners. Returning to Bishop and searching for a way out, they also find the CIA operative, whom Grimm and Branson had been lied to that he was found elsewhere by another agency's operation. At the grocery store checkout, Grimm hears Kinney's voicemail and immediately leaves, trying to call Nellis while driving to the base. As no one answers, Grimm is forced to rush to the control room and order the B-1 Lancer pilot to abort the bombing, right as it flies in front of Kinney, Bishop, and the CIA agent reaching the cave's entrance. As the soldiers are finally extracted in the Philippines, Grimm complains to the rest of the base crew and his superiors that three men nearly died because they were too distracted to hear their calls, despite being repeatedly asked to pay attention to the phone because of his pregnant wife, and he smashes the break room's main television in anger. Afterwards he convenes with Branson in a hangar, where she asks him to walk her down the aisle in her wedding, and he agrees and leads her in a dance.",

She chafes against his playful antics, insisting she can handle the situation with maturity. One night, Bea goes out to buy a charger for her mother's old camcorder and sees an unfamiliar creature, following it back to her grandmother's building. The next day, she sees the creature again, accompanied by a man. Bea follows them to a nearby house where the man, Cal, retrieves a large furry purple creature named Blue. She also meets the other creature, a butterfly-like being named Blossom, and faints. She awakens in Cal's apartment where she learns that he has been working with imaginary friends, nicknamed IFs, to place them with new children as their original children have grown up and forgotten them. Initially reluctant, Bea eventually decides to help Cal. The next day, Cal takes Bea to Memory Lane Retirement Home, a retirement community for IFs housed underneath a swing in Coney Island. There, he introduces Bea to Lewis, an elderly teddy bear who is the head of the facility. He inspires Bea to use her imagination to redesign the facility, much to the chagrin of Cal. Bea tries to match one of the IFs with Benjamin, a young patient at the hospital. She, Cal, and Lewis audition the IFs, but he is unable to see any of them. Feeling unmotivated, Bea talks with Lewis on the Coney Island pier. He gives her an idea that maybe IFs do not need new kids, but rather to reunite with their old ones. Talking with her grandmother, she sees a picture of her as a young dancer and recognizes Blossom in the background of the picture. Realizing Blossom was her grandmother's IF, Bea decides to test Lewis' idea. Playing one of her grandmother's records inspires Margaret to dance and she remembers Blossom, instilling Bea with hope. Following a tip, Bea, Cal, and Blue find Blue's original kid, Jeremy, now a grown man trying to launch a business. By eating a fresh croissant in front of Jeremy, Bea reminds him of his childhood home above his parents' bakery; Jeremy remembers Blue enough for Blue to give Jeremy the confidence he needs for a business presentation. That evening, Bea arrives at Margaret's to find her hastily preparing for a return to the hospital because there's been a complication with her father's treatment. Bea rushes upstairs to Cal, who comforts her. When Bea says she does not want to say goodbye to her dad, Cal advises her to tell him a story instead. At the hospital, a nurse reassures Bea that her father will be all right. She tells him a story about realizing she was pushing herself to act like a grown-up when she's just a child who still needs her father. He wakes up and they reassure each other. Bea goes upstairs to thank Cal, but no one answers his door. The landlady shows Bea that the door opens into an old storage room. After her dad is released from the hospital, he and Bea pack up to go home. Bea finds an old picture she painted of herself, her parents and a clown named Calvin. She suddenly realizes that Cal is her own IF, forgotten after the death of her mother. She rushes back to see Cal, now able to see him again, and wishes him a farewell. After Bea and her father drive off, Margaret asks Blossom if the two of them should go inside, causing Blossom to realize Margaret can see her. Some time later, Cal begins reuniting the IFs with their original kids, now grown up. Benjamin meets his IF, a cartoonish dragon with glasses.

She also meets the other creature, a butterfly-like being named Blossom, and faints. She rushes back to see Cal, now able to see him again, and wishes him a farewell. She tells him a story about realizing she was pushing herself to act like a grown-up when she's just a child who still needs her father. She awakens in Cal's apartment where she learns that he has been working with imaginary friends, nicknamed IFs, to place them with new children as their original children have grown up and forgotten them. When Bea says she does not want to say goodbye to her dad, Cal advises her to tell him a story instead. The next day, she sees the creature again, accompanied by a man. He wakes up and they reassure each other. She chafes against his playful antics, insisting she can handle the situation with maturity. Bea finds an old picture she painted of herself, her parents and a clown named Calvin. She, Cal, and Lewis audition the IFs, but he is unable to see any of them. He gives her an idea that maybe IFs do not need new kids, but rather to reunite with their old ones. After Bea and her father drive off, Margaret asks Blossom if the two of them should go inside, causing Blossom to realize Margaret can see her. One night, Bea goes out to buy a charger for her mother's old camcorder and sees an unfamiliar creature, following it back to her grandmother's building. There, he introduces Bea to Lewis, an elderly teddy bear who is the head of the facility. Bea goes upstairs to thank Cal, but no one answers his door. At the hospital, a nurse reassures Bea that her father will be all right. Bea tries to match one of the IFs with Benjamin, a young patient at the hospital. He inspires Bea to use her imagination to redesign the facility, much to the chagrin of Cal. Initially reluctant, Bea eventually decides to help Cal. After her dad is released from the hospital, he and Bea pack up to go home. The next day, Cal takes Bea to Memory Lane Retirement Home, a retirement community for IFs housed underneath a swing in Coney Island. Realizing Blossom was her grandmother's IF, Bea decides to test Lewis' idea. Bea follows them to a nearby house where the man, Cal, retrieves a large furry purple creature named Blue. Some time later, Cal begins reuniting the IFs with their original kids, now grown up. Feeling unmotivated, Bea talks with Lewis on the Coney Island pier. Bea and her father return home, where he trips over Keith, his invisible imaginary friend. 12-year-old Bea moves into her grandmother Margaret's apartment in New York while her father waits for heart surgery in the same hospital where her mother died of cancer years earlier. Bea rushes upstairs to Cal, who comforts her. Playing one of her grandmother's records inspires Margaret to dance and she remembers Blossom, instilling Bea with hope. Following a tip, Bea, Cal, and Blue find Blue's original kid, Jeremy, now a grown man trying to launch a business. By eating a fresh croissant in front of Jeremy, Bea reminds him of his childhood home above his parents' bakery; Jeremy remembers Blue enough for Blue to give Jeremy the confidence he needs for a business presentation. Talking with her grandmother, she sees a picture of her as a young dancer and recognizes Blossom in the background of the picture. That evening, Bea arrives at Margaret's to find her hastily preparing for a return to the hospital because there's been a complication with her father's treatment.",

    "ground_truth":"In 1976, amidst armed political conflict that is affecting daily life in Jamaica, Bob Marley announces he will perform at a concert, Smile Jamaica, promoting peace amongst the warring factions. While preparing for the concert, Marley, his wife Rita, and several other members of his band are shot by assailants. Rita and Marley are hospitalized, but survive and recover from their injuries in time for the concert. After performing, Marley, saddened that his own countrymen would try to kill him and his wife, shows the crowd his bullet wounds before walking off stage. He tells Rita to take their children to Delaware in the United States and stay with his mom, as he and the rest of his band venture to London. After struggling to come up with a new album concept, Marley asks Rita to rejoin him and the band in England, and taking inspiration from the soundtrack of the film Exodus and their own situation, he and the band begin recording what would become their album of the same name. The album becomes a hit and helps further popularize reggae music and the Rastafari movement around the world. When the recording company schedules a tour in Europe, Marley also aims for stops throughout Africa to inspire the people there. This leads to friction with Rita as she and Marley argue about his responsibilities and both his and Rita's infidelities, in addition to having given up on promoting peace back in Jamaica. Marley also gets into an altercation with manager Don Taylor over a financial dispute. After a toenail infection raises concern from Rita and his record producer Chris Blackwell, Marley is later diagnosed with a rare skin cancer. Blackwell confronts Marley about treatment choices, reluctantly dismissed by a firm Marley. Faced with his own mortality, Marley reconciles with Rita and Taylor and finally decides to return to Jamaica in 1978, where he is welcomed back by a crowd at the airport. Back home, the gunman who had shot him and the others arrives and begs for forgiveness, to which Marley states he ‘keeps no vengeance’. After Marley debuts a song to Rita and the children about reconciliation, she finally deems him ready to perform a peace concert. The film ends as Marley and his band gear up to perform again for the Jamaican crowd with the song ‘One Love’. A pre-credits montage shows clips of the real Marley and his band during the One Love Peace Concert, which sees them joined on-stage by the heads of both of Jamaica's political parties, also revealing that Marley and his band were able to perform in Zimbabwe to celebrate the nation's independence before he died of his cancer in 1981 at the age of 36.",

After the group captures a ghost in Hell's Kitchen, Walter Peck, the Ghostbusters' long-time opponent, threatens to close them down with his authority as mayor.

Upset, Phoebe attempts to control her emotions by playing chess in a nearby park, where she encounters and befriends Melody, the ghost of a teenage girl who died in a fire.

Ray suspects it is an apotropaic trap. When he tests its PKE levels, the orb immediately emits broad-spectrum telekinetic energy. A frosty wave travels from the orb to the Ghostbusters' firehouse headquarters and damages the ecto-containment unit, which is dangerously near capacity. Winston takes the orb to his privately owned paranormal research center, run by Dr. Lars Pinfield. Using an experimental extraction device, Lars is unable to extract any spiritual energy from the orb.

Meanwhile, Ray, accompanied by Phoebe and Podcast, visits Dr. Hubert Wartzki, a New York Public Library research librarian. Wartzki explains the orb was built millennia ago by four sorcerers called the Firemasters to imprison Garraka, a phantom god who sought to conquer the world with an undead army who would use ‘Kusharit Umoti’ - ‘the power to kill by fear itself.’ They learn Nadeem's grandmother belonged to the lineage of Firemasters, one of whom prevented Garraka from escaping the orb in 1904 during a mock ritual conducted by members of the Manhattan Adventurers' Society, whom Garraka froze to death. Garraka was confined in the orb due to being vulnerable to copper alloys combined with fire and lacking his devil horns which augment his powers.

The orb is built millennia ago by four sorcerers called the Firemasters to imprison Garraka, a phantom god who sought to conquer the world with an undead army using 'Kusharit Umoti' - 'the power to kill by fear itself.'

    "ground_truth":"Many generations after Caesar's death, apes have established numerous clans, while most humans have become feral-esque. Noa, a young chimpanzee from a falconry-practicing clan, prepares for a coming-of-age ceremony by collecting eagle eggs with his friends Anaya and Soona. However, a human scavenger follows Noa home and inadvertently cracks his egg during a scuffle before fleeing. While searching for a replacement egg, Noa encounters a group of ape raiders using electric weapons. As Noa hides from them, the apes follow his horse back to his clan. Noa hurries home to find his village burning; the raider leader Sylva kills Noa's father before dropping Noa from a high platform. Left for dead, Noa awakens, discovering that his clan has been abducted. He buries his father and sets out to rescue his clan. On his journey, he is joined by Raka, an orangutan who tells Noa about Caesar's teachings. The apes notice they are being followed by the human scavenger; Raka offers her food and a blanket, naming her Nova. When the trio encounters a group of feral humans, Sylva's raiders suddenly attack. Noa and Raka rescue Nova who, to their surprise, can speak. She reveals that her name is Mae and that the raiders took Noa's clan to a beachfront settlement outside an old human vault. As they cross a bridge on their way to the settlement, they are ambushed by Sylva. In the ensuing fight, Raka saves Mae from drowning but is swept away by the rapids. Noa and Mae are captured and taken to the apes' settlement. Noa reunites with his clan and is introduced to the apes' self-proclaimed king, Proximus Caesar. Proximus has enslaved other clans, forcing them to work on opening the vault so he can access the human technology locked inside. Proximus invites Noa to dinner along with Mae and Trevathan, a human prisoner who is teaching Proximus about the old human world. Proximus believes that Noa's intelligence could help open the vault and warns him that Mae only has her own agenda. Noa confronts Mae, demanding the truth in exchange for his help. Mae discloses knowledge of a hidden entrance to the vault and says that a mysterious ‘book’ capable of restoring speech to humanity is inside. Noa agrees to help her enter the vault, hoping to destroy Proximus' settlement and lead his clan back home. Noa, Mae, Soona, and Anaya secretly plant explosives around the levee that surrounds the settlement. Trevathan catches them and intends to warn Proximus, but Mae kills him. The group enters the vault, which is a military bunker housing a stockpile of weapons and Mae's 'book', which is actually a deciphering key for a satellite. The apes discover old picture books depicting humans as the once-dominant species and apes in cages at a zoo. As the group makes their way out of the bunker, they are confronted by Proximus and his tribe. Lightning, one of Proximus's apes threatens to kill Soona, but Mae kills him with a gun she found. Proximus tells Mae that she can leave if she tells him where the other weapons are. Mae refuses and triggers the explosives, flooding the bunker with the apes inside. Mae flees the settlement while the apes climb to higher ground through the bunker. Noa is pursued by Sylva, but Noa traps and drowns him. Noa escapes the bunker with his clan, but Proximus attacks him. Noa leads his clan in summoning their eagles to attack Proximus and send him falling off a cliff into the sea. As Noa's clan returns to rebuild their home, Mae arrives to bid farewell to Noa, concealing a gun behind her back but never revealing or using it. She explains that she destroyed the bunker and prevented the apes from accessing the weapons in the bunker because those weapons were created by humans and should only be used by humans. Noa then argues that if weapons and technology are only for humans, it suggests that nothing belongs to the apes, questioning whether apes and humans can coexist peacefully given Mae's fundamental disparity.

Master Shifu then tells Po that he must advance and become a spiritual leader, which means Po can no longer be the Dragon Warrior and must find a suitable successor to take his place. Po struggles to choose the right candidate as he does not want to lose his status as the Dragon Warrior, and he stumbles upon a fox bandit named Zhen trying to steal ancient weapons from the Jade Palace. Po is able to outsmart Zhen and send her to prison, but a group of mine workers tell him that Tai Lung has returned and destroyed an entire quarry. Zhen reveals that Tai Lung's return was masqueraded by a sorceress known as The Chameleon, who can shape-shift into any animal she wants as well as copying various kung fu techniques simply by touching them. With Zhen's assistance, Po heads to Juniper City to take down The Chameleon, little knowing that his fathers, worried that Po is in over his head this time, are following them. After encountering a shifty tavern and fighting off the inhabitants, they soon arrive at Juniper City. They are almost arrested and escape to the Den of Thieves, where they receive aid from the den's leader Han, who is also a close friend of Zhen. From there, Po and Zhen head to The Chameleon's lair until Po is captured. It is then revealed that Zhen has been acting as a double agent for The Chameleon; her task was to acquire Po's Staff of Wisdom, which has the power to access the Spirit Realm. Po almost manages to escape, but The Chameleon, taking the form of Zhen, fools him and throws him off a cliff. He nearly falls to his death, but is rescued by his fathers, who convince him that sometimes change can be good.

They battle, but when Zhen intervenes, The Chameleon turns into a Chimera of several kung fu masters. After the battle, she then shifts into a copycat of Po, fights him, and soon traps him in a cage. Putting his trust in Zhen, Po gives her the Staff of Wisdom, with which she bests The Chameleon. Po, who was only pretending to be trapped, defeats The Chameleon using the staff and returns all of the stolen kung fu to their owners, who show respect to Po and return to the Spirit Realm, with Tai Lung taking The Chameleon with him.

Ping open their new restaurant. After escaping for good, Zhen reunites with Po, but he refuses to back down from facing The Chameleon, so she, Ping and Li head back to the Den of Thieves to convince them to help them save Po. Master Shifu then tells Po that he must advance and become a spiritual leader, which means Po can no longer be the Dragon Warrior and must find a suitable successor to take his place. Putting his trust in Zhen, Po gives her the Staff of Wisdom, with which she bests The Chameleon. Confident with his choice, Po and the Furious Five help train Zhen to become the next Dragon Warrior. They battle, but when Zhen intervenes, The Chameleon turns into a Chimera of several kung fu masters. He nearly falls to his death, but is rescued by his fathers, who convince him that sometimes change can be good. As they battle The Chameleon's army of Komodo dragons, Po attempts to reason with The Chameleon to no avail, although she does give the staff back to him as she no longer needs it. While returning to the Valley of Peace, Po chooses Zhen as his successor, much to Shifu's annoyance. In the Valley of Peace, Po helps Li Shan and Mr. Zhen reveals that Tai Lung's return was masqueraded by a sorceress known as The Chameleon, who can shape-shift into any animal she wants as well as copying various kung fu techniques simply by touching them. Po almost manages to escape, but The Chameleon, taking the form of Zhen, fools him and throws him off a cliff. With Zhen's assistance, Po heads to Juniper City to take down The Chameleon, little knowing that his fathers, worried that Po is in over his head this time, are following them. After encountering a shifty tavern and fighting off the inhabitants, they soon arrive at Juniper City. Po is able to outsmart Zhen and send her to prison, but a group of mine workers tell him that Tai Lung has returned and destroyed an entire quarry. After the battle, she then shifts into a copycat of Po, fights him, and soon traps him in a cage.

    "ground_truth":"Three years after defeating Mechagodzilla, Kong has established his new territory in the Hollow Earth and searches for more of his kind. On Earth's surface, Godzilla continues to maintain order between humanity and giant monsters, known as ‘Titans’ — killing Titan Scylla in Rome and resting in the Colosseum afterwards. A Monarch observation outpost stationed in Hollow Earth picks up an unidentified signal. On the surface, the signal causes Jia, the last known survivor of the Iwi tribe from Skull Island, to experience hallucinations and visions, causing her adoptive mother and Kong expert, Dr. Ilene Andrews, to worry. Also sensing the signal, Godzilla leaves Rome and attacks a nuclear plant in France to absorb radiation. He then heads to the lair of the Titan Tiamat in the Arctic. Monarch believes Godzilla is strengthening himself for an oncoming threat. When a sinkhole opens near his home, Kong discovers an uncharted realm where a tribe of his species has survived, including a juvenile named Suko. After a brief initial confrontation, Kong convinces Suko to lead him to the tribe's lair, and the two slowly bond on their journey. The tribe's tyrannical leader, Skar King, battles Kong with the aid of an ancient ice-powered Titan, Shimo, whom he controls with pain using a crystal. Shimo's ice breath injures Kong's right arm, causing frostbite, but with Suko's help, Kong manages to escape after losing his axe. Andrews and Jia, alongside Titan veterinarian Trapper and conspiracy podcaster Bernie Hayes, travel to Hollow Earth to locate the source of the signal. They find the Monarch outpost destroyed. As the group follows the signal, they discover a temple that leads them to a subterranean section that houses a surviving Iwi tribe, who communicate telepathically with each other, living beneath portals to the surface. Inspecting some ruins, they surmise that the signal was a telepathic distress call sent by the Iwi. While observing Jia socializing with the Iwi, Andrews voices her fears to Trapper that Jia may choose to stay with her people and that Andrews would have to accept it. Inside a temple, Andrews uncovers hieroglyphics displaying the past and future: Skar King once attempted to conquer the surface world, forced Shimo to trigger an ice age, and waged war against Godzilla's species, but Godzilla defeated him by trapping him and his tribe deep within Hollow Earth. The prophecy also indicates that Jia would be the key to reawakening Mothra. Sensing Jia, Kong locates the temple and is fitted by Trapper with a prototype exoskeletal glove to strengthen and heal his frostbitten limb. Unknown to them, one of Skar King's loyalists follows them and informs him that the protective barrier leading to the surface portals has been opened. Jia successfully awakens the reborn Mothra. Meanwhile, Godzilla kills Tiamat and absorbs cosmic radiation from her lair, which turns his dorsal plates magenta. Hoping to lure Godzilla to Hollow Earth to assist him, Kong surfaces in Cairo and calls out to Godzilla. Despite Kong's attempts to communicate, Godzilla attacks him, and a brief fight ensues until Mothra intervenes. Godzilla, Kong, and Mothra return to the Hollow Earth and engage Skar King and Shimo in battle. Skar King and Shimo manage to use one of the portals to escape to the surface, forcing Godzilla and Kong to chase them to Rio de Janeiro, and Shimo induces a second ice age at Skar King's command. The factions are evenly matched until Suko arrives with Kong's axe and destroys the crystal controlling Shimo. Shimo freezes Skar King before Kong shatters him to pieces. After undoing Shimo's ice age with his atomic breath, Godzilla returns to rest in the Colosseum. Jia reunites with Andrews and alleviates her fears by choosing to stay with her adopted mother.

    "ground_truth":"In 1973 in the jungles of Peru, a research team led by Ezekiel Sims and his pregnant colleague Constance Webb discovers an unidentified species of spider with rare healing properties. Ezekiel betrays the team and claims the spider for himself, shooting Constance in a struggle over the spider before leaving her for dead. An indigenous tribe attempts to save Constance by having the spider bite her, but she dies shortly after giving birth to Cassandra. Thirty years later, Cassandra, going by 'Cassie', works as a paramedic in New York City alongside her co-workers Ben Parker and O'Neil. During a dangerous call, Cassie falls into the water and has a near-death experience. Ben revives her, but she begins to experience visions. Initially, she dismisses them as déjà vu, but after failing to prevent O'Neil's death, Cassie realizes that she can see into the future. Ezekiel, who has limited precognition power and enhanced physical abilities, collects information on three teenage girls: Julia Cornwall, Anya Corazon, and Mattie Franklin. His visions lead him to believe that they are destined to kill him. Cassie is also drawn to the same girls and intervenes to stop Ezekiel from ambushing them at Grand Central Terminal. She steals a taxi and takes Julia, Anya, and Mattie out of the city to hide them in a nearby forest. Cassie returns to her apartment and finds Constance's notes, which reveal Ezekiel's identity and the true nature of his powers. Ignoring Cassie's instructions, the girls go to a diner where Ezekiel finds them. After briefly incapacitating Ezekiel by ramming him with the car, Cassie takes the girls back to Queens and they take refuge in Ben's house.

    "ground_truth":"In 2010, New York City photographer Jae Donnelly stakes out a private Manhattan home for an exclusive shot. He eventually photographs Prince Andrew walking with Jeffrey Epstein in Central Park after photographing a young girl leaving from the same building just prior. Nine years later, directly after major staffing cuts are announced, young BBC Newsnight guest producer Sam McAlister comes across the photo placed next to a Prince Andrew sponsored, young entrepreneurs event article. So, she tries to contact the photographer. Prince Andrew's private secretary Amanda Thirsk believes the Epstein photo is a key reason the palace's event was not attended by the press. PR representative Jason Stein is consulted, but the prince insists he ended his friendship with Epstein after the mogul's original underage sex scandals had come to light. Jason suggests Amanda should reach out to several 'friendly' reporters to conduct one-on-one interviews to improve Andrew's image. Having spoken to Sam recently, Amanda agrees to meet and negotiate terms for an interview. Called out by a co-worker for being vocally critical of lead presenter Emily Maitlis and for having sensationalist leanings, the programme editor, Esme, has a word with Sam. Including Emily in the dialogue, she tells her she welcomes her innovations, but reminds her they must find a way to work together regardless of the tension. Jae gets back to Sam, sharing photos of young girls going in and out of Epstein's Manhattan home. He insists that Epstein has been doing it for many years. Arriving home, Sam finds her mother, who has been looking after her teenage son Lucas. Working long hours, she does not get to see him often, but she tries to bond with him over a crush he has on a girl and buying him takeout. The next day, Amanda invites Sam to Buckingham Palace. After tea, Sam convinces her to leave the grounds for a drink. Amid negotiations for the potential interview with Prince Andrew, Amanda asks what Emily is like, then what Sam knows about her. She knows that she is also a single mother, formally worked in banking and has been working for Andrew for seven years. Both Amanda are criticised for meeting Sam for drinks by Jason and Sam by another journalist. Upset by the altercation, Sam vents to her mother. Jae calls to let her know that Epstein is about to be taken into custody by the FBI for child sex trafficking. After informing Esme, Sam rushes to Amanda's home to convince Prince Andrew to give Newsnight a TV interview. They hold off until Epstein is suddenly found dead in his cell, and rumours circulate about the men's friendship. Sam gets her and Emily a negotiation meeting in Buckingham Palace with Amanda, the Prince and his daughter Beatrice. Once Newsnight secures the 'scoop of the decade', Sam is seemingly left out of the loop, as Esme and Emily work with two male journalists and do not include her. Her mother gives her a pep talk, reminding her that she was responsible for the story. In the morning, Amanda calls Sam with the interview time. The televised interview broadcast on 16 November 2019 focuses on Andrew's relationship with convicted sex offender Epstein and allegations of Andrew's sexual assault of a minor, which Andrew denies on several occasions. His lack of remorse and accountability on screen – along with now-infamous bizarre, erratic statements about visiting a PizzaExpress in Woking and an apparent inability to sweat – is widely viewed as the public catalyst for the downfall of Prince Andrew, and a major PR crisis for the Royal Family as a whole. Soon afterwards, the Duke chooses to step down from his royal duties. Despite not admitting guilt, in early 2022, Prince Andrew settled out of court for £12 million for Virginia Giuffre's civil lawsuit for alleged sexual assault. Sam McAlister left the BBC in 2021 and now teaches negotiation at the London School of Economics.",

    "ground_truth":"Alin (Esra Bilgic) and Ozan (Ushan Cakir) are Interpol officers who have been assigned to investigate a series of art thefts around the world. The thief seems to be breaking into museums and stealing the least valuable works of art, ignoring the other priceless artifacts in the same location. They quickly realize that the art thief is not grabbing the least valued paintings at the museums but specifically all paintings related to love. Putting this together helps them figure out the next target for the thief. Alin is right, but the thief is able to grab the painting in broad daylight with no one knowing and leave Alin just enough of a trace, see his face, but not be able to catch him. Alin immediately knows who the thief is now. Her ex-lover, Guney (Birkan Sokullu). Guney and Alin were going steady when he suddenly disappeared, without explanation, and left her heart broken. Interpol chief refuses to arrest Guney, as he is a billionaire and can easily buy the paintings he wants. He also says that Alin has a history with Guney, and hence they need solid evidence against him. Alin decides she's going to use her charm to catch Guney red-handed. When Alin approaches Guney, he asks her for a second chance, and she pretends to reluctantly give in. Guney explains that he ran away the first time as he was scared of commitment. In the meantime, Ozan has the information to figure out who is working with Guney now, and they also find a warehouse where they work. Alin tries to go there and get some evidence, but she's caught by Vera, Guney's hacker. Vera and Alin get into a physical fight, leading Vera to believe Alin is a cop. But she only manages to see her eyes as Alin was wise enough to cover her face. From the recovered material, Alin figures out that the next theft will be in Prague. Alin and Guney spend more time together, and he tells her that he doesn't want to spend time apart, but he has a business trip to Prague for two days. Alin convinces him to take her along. This is when she gets the billionaire treatment, and he takes her on a private jet and gifts her fancy new clothes. On the flight, Vera finds something strange about Alin and tells the other guy on their team, Omer (Hakan Ummak), that she might have been the cop who tried to break into the warehouse. At the time, Guney had dismissed the idea and said it must have been a random break-in. Alin's partner shows up at the hotel, saying she can't be doing a mission that her chief denied, but she's determined to catch Guney. However, Ozan thinks it's just her attraction to him that's keeping her there. Guney takes Alin to a private dress rehearsal for a romantic musical she's been wanting to watch, and it is enough for her to fall for Guney again. Alin and Guney almost go all the way in his hotel room, but Alin claims they're going too fast and leaves. The next day is the day of the robbery, and Guney leaves Alin with a car to use all day while he has some work. The second he's gone, Ozan and she follow him. Yet again, they're unable to catch him, and they're back to Istanbul and square one. Faysal Varli is an old man and a sleaze who is a businessman, and Guney plans on buying his company. Faysal has a private painting collection. He gives Alin and Guney a private viewing of this collection, and immediately, Alin realizes they're all stolen. This gives Guney the idea to break into the highly protected collection. This is a foolproof security system with too many layers, yet Guney has the confidence to break into it. There's a voice and face recognition step, and there are about 75 cameras leading up to the collection, so it's almost an impossible task. Additionally, there's a set of words, like a pass key, that keeps changing, that Faysal himself has to repeat for the vault to open. It's his voice that's recognized, but Guney has a solution for it all. Just as Guney is trying to break in and everything is going to plan, Faysal decides to bring a woman down to the vault. Vera freaks out, but just when they're about to enter the room, Faysal is asked to go back to the house. Alin is there to tell Faysal that his collection is going to be stolen from him, but he doesn't believe her. She tells him that she doesn't know who it will be, but she knows there's a plan. This is obviously not the answer he wants, so he chokes her to try and get her to spill, but Ozan shows up at that moment. He asks for the crime scene, but Faysal tells him to leave if he doesn't have a warrant. Alin decides the best thing to do is leave and take Ozan and the team with her. The next day, Faysal shows up in her bedroom, and finds out it was Guney who stole the painting thanks to her notes in her apartment with all the investigation on Guney. Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and tell him the truth. Guney already knew that Alin worked for Interpol, and he left a trail for her to find him on purpose. Guney had disappeared for some time without a trace because he was caught in Mexico. This left Alin heartbroken because he never reached out to her or told her anything about what he used to do. After 3 years, he did a press conference to show up on the grid again, but by this time, Alin had already started to work for Interpol in Paris. Apparently, he found it really hard to find her, and when he did, he couldn't just tell her he was a thief. So now, he basically made her go in circles to fall in love with him again. Guney takes Alin to his grandfather's house. It seems he got interested in art thanks to his grandfather, who was a wonderful painter but was never recognized for his work. However, the reason Guney decided to start stealing is because when they were first together, Alin told him that the Mona Lisa went up in value only after it got stolen. Faysal stands across from Guney and Alin in front of a lake, a dead end. Faysal shoots past Guney's ear, just missing him to threaten him. This is after Guney has been tormenting Alin to tell him she still loves him all the way while running away from Faysal. Just as Faysal is about to shoot again, Ozan shows up. Guney did Ozan a favor by giving him information about Faysal (when Guney broke into Faysal's vault, he found information and documents that linked Faysal to the drugs trade); in return, Ozan will leave Guney alone because he's only a harmless art and heart stealing person. Since Ozan is an ex-narcotics officer, he is, of course, thrilled to lock up Faysal. Alin promises not to turn Guney in and tells him she loves him. There are two options, one is that Alin stops working for Interpol so that she and Guney can go on a robbing spree since they won't really have anything else to do and they're both clearly so interested in art. On the other hand, Guney will stop stealing for the thrill of it and go back to being just a boring old billionaire. Or maybe they start an underground art gallery together with all the stolen pieces and never get found out.",

    "ground_truth":"Kora and the surviving warriors return to Veldt, believing that Kora had killed Admiral Noble in hand-to-hand combat and prevented the forthcoming assault on the planet to claim its food supplies, but Aris, a Motherworld soldier working as a double agent for the village people, informs them that the dreadnought ship will arrive in five days. The fighters join the small group of villagers to harvest the entire grain supply in three days, so the flour can be used as leverage to prevent the Motherworld forces from simply bombing the village from orbit; over the remaining two days, Titus intends to train the villagers to fight. Kora and Gunnar become lovers, and she admits that Regent Balisarius compelled her involvement in the assassination of the Motherworld's king, queen, and young Princess Issa, with Kora herself shooting the princess. Balisarius had then attempted to frame her for the coup, but she had instead fled to Veldt in a Motherworld shuttle to hide from the law. Over two days, Titus, Nemesis, Tarak, Milius, and Kora train the handful of villagers in combat, preparing a plan involving digging trenches and tunnels in the fields, laying explosives, and preparing Kora's shuttle. The group also reveal their pasts to each other, but Kora declines to share her involvement in Issa's death. When Noble arrives with the dreadnought, his forces scan the village, identifying where the women and children are hiding, protected by Nemesis and Aris, and send forces to capture them to force Kora out. Kora attempts to surrender to him once Noble promises to spare the village, but Gunnar triggers the ambush anyway. Titus and Tarak lead the villages in successfully repelling the first wave, though Nemesis is killed defending the women and children. The large contingent of heavily armored and mechanized second wave of Motherworld troops pushes the few remaining defenders back, destroying much of the village, but Kora and Gunnar use the shuttle and stolen uniforms to infiltrate the dreadnought, laying explosives on the engine. Jimmy arrives to help the village defenders push back the assault, and the explosives bring down the dreadnought. In the process, Gunnar kills Noble but later dies from his injuries. Devra Bloodaxe and her rebel forces arrive in ships to destroy the remaining Motherworld troops, leading to victory. In the aftermath, the village mourns the dead, and Kora admits her past, which Titus reveals he already knew. He also reveals that Issa is secretly alive and in hiding, and the assembled group declare their intentions to find her and restore the royal lineage to the throne in order to depose Balisarius.",

Over two days, Titus, Nemesis, Tarak, Milius, and Kora train the handful of villagers in combat, preparing a plan involving digging trenches and tunnels in the fields, laying explosives, and preparing Kora's shuttle. When Noble arrives with the dreadnought, his forces scan the village, identifying where the women and children are hiding, protected by Nemesis and Aris, and send forces to capture them to force Kora out. Kora and the surviving warriors return to Veldt, believing that Kora had killed Admiral Noble in hand-to-hand combat and prevented the forthcoming assault on the planet to claim its food supplies, but Aris, a Motherworld soldier working as a double agent for the village people, informs them that the dreadnought ship will arrive in five days. Jimmy arrives to help the village defenders push back the assault, and the explosives bring down the dreadnought. Devra Bloodaxe and her rebel forces arrive in ships to destroy the remaining Motherworld troops, leading to victory. In the process, Gunnar kills Noble but later dies from his injuries."

    "ground_truth":"Cyrus (Kevin Hart), a renowned international thief, leads a heist crew that consists of Denton (Vincent D'Onofrio), pilot Camila (Ursula Corbero), hacker Mi-Sun (Kim Yoon-Ji), safe-cracker Magnus (Billy Magnussen), and engineer Luke (Viveik Kalra). They undertake two simultaneous thefts, stealing a Van Gogh painting in London while staging the fake kidnapping of renowned NFT artist N8 (Jacob Batalon) in Venice. N8 was in Venice to auction a single edition NFT. The NFT by N8 is made by a self portrait mask comprising of 482 cameras. This mask will create the NFT, with a live 30-second feed from the auction itself. Once complete, the NFT will have captured the moment of its sale, which will include the buyer. The team staged a kidnapping for N8 and Cyrus points out that famous paintings rapidly increase in value after being stolen and he says that his crew stole the Van Gogh painting and sold it in the black market for $20 million to buy N8 NFTs. After being 'kidnapped', N8's NFT ballooned in value to $89 million. N8 decides to celebrate with the team after being promised a cut of the money ($27 million). Interpol agent Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a former fling of Cyrus, uncovers evidence implicating Denton, in the theft and arrests him. Denton was seen at the auction and Abby correctly deduced that his limp was a fake. Abby charges Denton with fraud since he participated in the auction and made a bid of more than $10 million, and he didn't have the funds to cover it. So that makes him eligible for extradition to the US. Rather than proceed with charges against the crew, Abby's superior, Commander Huxley (Sam Worthington), leverages their legal predicament to force them to help capture billionaire Lars Jorgenson (Jean Reno), who intends to make more money by working with the hacking group Leviathan to stage a massive flooding in Europe, allowing him to make billions in profit through stock manipulation. Lars was responsible for making millions by shorting airlines stock, after the crash of a New Zealand plane that killed 189 people. Now Huxley has a mole in Lars's organization named Arthur Tigue. As Leviathan requires payment of $500 million in untraceable gold bullion, Jorgenson has arranged for a shipment of gold to be taken from his vault in London and flown to Leviathan's bank in Zurich via a commercial airliner. Huxley cannot intercept the gold as it is a legal transaction. Huxley wants Cyrus and his crew to intercept this gold payment to Leviathan. Cyrus knows that Lars is a dangerous man and not to be trifled with, but Abby lures him in with an offer of full immunity for him and his entire crew, As part of the deal, Cyrus insists Abby join the team to provide certain cover for Interpol. Cyrus argues that with Abby on the team Interpol will not hang the team out to dry if things do not go as per plan. The gold weighs ten tons and will be delivered to Heathrow airport under armored cover. It will be loaded onto a Sky Suisse A-380 passenger plane to Zurich. The crew determines they will only be able to steal the gold while the airliner is in mid-air. To do so, they procure a private jet from a rich private art collector named Molsen that Camila will fly directly underneath the airliner, allowing Mi-Sun to switch the radar signals to make it seem like the plane is still on course while the crew diverts it to a private airfield. Mi-Sun says that the chances of turning on the signal Jammer on the A-380 and the transponder on the private jet (to mimic the A-380's signal) are next to zero. Out of UK airspace, Brussels ATC will be tracking the flight, and Abby has a contact there who will help them. Harry agrees to help Cyrus against a payment of a million dollars. In exchange for loaning his private jet, Cyrus promises Molsen to persuade N8 to make a special NFT art for him. After Magnus cracks the safe and Jorgenson's henchmen are incapacitated, the crew will extract the gold from the A-380 once it lands in the Swiss Alps. Their timing is complicated when Jorgenson executes a mole Arthur Tigue (Jess Liaudin) in his organization and moves up the delivery date. Nevertheless, the crew is ready on time. The crew takes their position on the A-380 on the day the gold is being transferred, but Luke pulls out of the heist at the last minute. Cyrus and his team successfully divert the plane. Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the A-380, Abby assembles and turns on the signal Jammer on the A-380, while Camila turns on the transponder to mimic the A-380 signal. Harry then calls the A-380 pilots and diverts them to Cortina due to heavy weather in Zurich. Camila puts the transponder on a drone headed to Zurich and follows the A-380 to Cortina. Jorgenson's henchmen (including Cormac (Burn Gorman) & Donal (Paul Anderson)) attempt a hijack, resulting in the plane crash landing at Cortina, followed by Camila landing the Molsen jet at the airport. Magnus, Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured. Magnus escapes on the ground, while the remaining three are taken aboard the Molsen jet with the gold, headed for Jorgenson's estate in Tuscany. Desperate for the gold to not reach Jorgenson, Huxley orders the plane shot down by NATO. Harry (David Proud), the crew's contact at air traffic control, works with Camila (who was piloting the Molsen jet) to get a message to the NATO fighter pilots that there are hostages on board the A-380, forcing them to stand down. Another fight between the crew and Jorgenson's henchmen results in the jet crash landing on the grounds of Jorgenson's villa. Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured at gunpoint by Jorgenson, who also executes Leviathan's representative after they decide to cancel the deal. The Carabinieri arrive, and Cyrus uses N8's NFT technology to show them a recording of Jorgenson murdering the representative. Jorgenson is arrested, while Abby punches Huxley upon learning he authorized the NATO jets. She resigns from Interpol and joins Cyrus. Weeks later, Cyrus reveals to Abby that the crew stole the gold shipment during the heist on the airliner, replacing the actual shipment with iron bars painted to look like gold. The real gold shipment was parachuted out of the A-380 into the Swiss Alps while it was approaching the Cortina landing strip. Luke was never out; he guided the parachute to a recoverable spot in the mountains via remote control. Together, the crew recover their gold haul and celebrate their success while Cyrus and Abby kindle their relationship.",

Camila puts the transponder on a drone headed to Zurich and follows the A-380 to Cortina. She resigns from Interpol and joins Cyrus. Now Huxley has a mole in Lars's organization named Arthur Tigue. Magnus, Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured. Jorgenson's henchmen (including Cormac (Burn Gorman) & Donal (Paul Anderson)) attempt a hijack, resulting in the plane crash landing at Cortina, followed by Camila landing the Molsen jet at the airport. It will be loaded onto a Sky Suisse A-380 passenger plane to Zurich. Another fight between the crew and Jorgenson's henchmen results in the jet crash landing on the grounds of Jorgenson's villa. The Carabinieri arrive, and Cyrus uses N8's NFT technology to show them a recording of Jorgenson murdering the representative. The gold weighs ten tons and will be delivered to Heathrow airport under armored cover. Rather than proceed with charges against the crew, Abby's superior, Commander Huxley (Sam Worthington), leverages their legal predicament to force them to help capture billionaire Lars Jorgenson (Jean Reno), who intends to make more money by working with the hacking group Leviathan to stage a massive flooding in Europe, allowing him to make billions in profit through stock manipulation. Denton was seen at the auction and Abby correctly deduced that his limp was a fake. After being 'kidnapped', N8's NFT ballooned in value to $89 million. N8 was in Venice to auction a single edition NFT. In exchange for loaning his private jet, Cyrus promises Molsen to persuade N8 to make a special NFT art for him. So that makes him eligible for extradition to the US. Cyrus (Kevin Hart), a renowned international thief, leads a heist crew that consists of Denton (Vincent D'Onofrio), pilot Camila (Ursula Corbero), hacker Mi-Sun (Kim Yoon-Ji), safe-cracker Magnus (Billy Magnussen), and engineer Luke (Viveik Kalra). Jorgenson is arrested, while Abby punches Huxley upon learning he authorized the NATO jets. Abby charges Denton with fraud since he participated in the auction and made a bid of more than $10 million, and he didn't have the funds to cover it.",

    "ground_truth":"Three childhood friends (Dean (Zac Efron), Wes (Jermaine Fowler), and JT (Andrew Santino)) prank one of their neighbors on Halloween Night (in 1999( by lighting a bag of dog feces on fire and leaving it on their doorstep. The fire spreads to the neighbor's scarecrow. Failing to put out the fire, Dean writes the name 'Ricky Stanicky' on one of their costume pieces, leading police to believe that Ricky Stanicky, an out-of-town kid, was responsible for the prank. Twenty years later, the trio continued to use Ricky Stanicky as their excuse to forego life obligations and avoid getting in trouble. JT and his wife, Susan (Anja Savcic), are about to have a baby shower, and Dean and his girlfriend, Erin (Lex Scott Davis), have been setting it up. Dean gets a call from 'Ricky' (who is really Wes), claiming that his testicular cancer is back, and that he is alone in Albany, New York. Erin and Susan encourage Dean and JT to spend time with Ricky. In reality, JT and Dean received tickets to see Marc Rebillet in Atlantic City, New Jersey. On their flight, the trio turn off their phones, post something as 'Ricky', and write in their Bible of Ricky Stanicky, detailing all of what 'Ricky Stanicky' has done. While in Atlantic City, they meet Rock-Hard Rod (John Cena), an actor and impersonator who sings sex-based parodies of popular songs. Rod is a major mooch, and soon the friends tire of him and want to be rid of him. Dean feels bad about how Rod was treated and apologizes to him, and this is when Rod gives Dean his business card. Shortly after, Dean learns that Susan went into labor six weeks early, forcing them to hurry back. At the hospital, the trio learn that Susan already gave birth to a boy named Whitaker. JT's mother-in-law, Leona (Heather Mitchell), does not believe Ricky Stanicky is real. Wes almost tells everyone the truth, but Dean pivots by saying that Ricky lied in order to celebrate being 5 years cancer-free with his best friends. Leona tells the trio that Ricky is invited to Whitaker's Bris. It turns out that Wes has been using the Ricky gig to score some alone time for himself (at the pot milk farm) away from his partner Keith (Daniel Monks). Wes also told Keith that he dated Ricky (who he said was a bi), just in case he needed an out with Keith. While Wes believes that it is time for them to come clean, Dean decides to hire Rod to play Ricky Stanicky. The guys had a 'Bible' on Ricky which had notes on every lie they told to their families about stuff they did with Ricky and share the same with Rod to bring him up to speed. At the Bris, Rod impresses everyone with his personality and knowledge as 'Ricky', including Leona, Carly (Erin's cousin), and Ted Summerhayes (William H. Macy) (Dean and JT's boss). Ricky riles Ted when he calls him an old school banker who works to make rich people richer. But Ted is also impressed when Ricky displays his knowledge of Ted's upcoming merger with World River. Ricky gives his stamp of approval to the merger. When Rod gives the trio the impression that he personally knows Carly's ex, Gary Polisner, they decide to drug Polisner with a Ketamine pill, but the Rabbi eats the pill instead. During the circumcision, the Rabbi Greenberg (Jeff Ross) has a reaction to the Ketamine, leaving Whitaker half-circumcised. Ricky uses Summerhayes' cigar cutter to complete the circumcision, causing everyone to celebrate. The next day, Summerhayes reveals that in preparation for their merger with World River, a major company from San Francisco, he has hired Ricky Stanicky for $250,000 per year to advise on the World River deal. Dean and JT are angry as this is more than what they make. Erin also drops by, revealing that she scored a reporting gig for a local news channel's 'Hero of the Week' segment, and is pursuing a story on Ricky and his alleged humanitarian efforts. Dean & JT plan to get Ricky fired to get him out of their lives. Dean sets up Ricky to present his game changer idea to Ted for the World River merger. Summerhayes decides to start a charity organization per Ricky's suggestion and makes Ricky the head of the World River merger, replacing Dean. Ricky also tells Ted that he has an 'Air-Dicking' habit when he gives presentations. Ted realizes that nobody listens to a word he says as they are distracted by his mannerisms on stage. Ted promotes Ricky as he believes Ricky tells him the truth. Rod has no idea about the merger and begins to record Dean to ask for advice. In anger, Dean tells him that he is Rod, not Ricky. Rod reveals that he legally changed his name to Richard Barbara Stanicky and tells Dean that he is thankful for being given a new life. Rod says that he cannot go back to Atlantic City as he will be killed for some things he did (including being in debt to some mafia types), which he doesn't remember as he was drunk. Dean is depressed, as he is going to lose his job and relationship with Erin once Ricky is proven to be a fraud. The next day, there is a party between Summerhayes' company and World River, where they intend to watch the premiere of Ricky's 'Hero of the Week' segment. Erin meets with Dean and tells him that she knows Ricky Stanicky is Rock-Hard Rod. Erin is heartbroken and says that it is too late for his apologies now. At the party, Summerhayes introduces Dean, who confesses to all the guests that Ricky Stanicky is fake, apologizing and promptly leaving the party. The 'Hero of the Week' story begins playing, and Rod tells the reporter about how he met Dean, and how the Ricky Stanicky Bible made him realize that he needed to change his life. As Summerhayes is about to fire Dean, the World River executives approach Summerhayes and enthusiastically approve of his choice to hire Ricky, ready to agree to a merger. Summerhayes asks Dean his thoughts, and they agree to the merger. After learning the truth about Ricky, Susan tells JT he has to camp in the backyard for six months as punishment. Erin reveals to Dean that she decided to pursue the story about Rod becoming Ricky. Dean asks if she can forgive him. Erin states it will be difficult, but hearing Ricky's recording of Dean talking about his love and appreciation for Erin helps.

    "filtered_answer":"<PLOT_SUMMARY>\n\nTwenty years ago, Dean, Wes, and JT, three childhood friends, tricked their neighbor Rod into replacing Ricky Stanicky on Halloween Night (1999) by lighting a bag of dog feces on fire and leaving it on their doorstep. Angry, Dean tells Rod that he is not Ricky. When they learn that Susan has given birth to a boy named Whitaker, Dean, Wes, and JT decide to drug Gary Polisner (Carly's ex) with a Ketamine pill, but Rabbi Greenberg eats it instead. Dean feels bad for how Rod was treated and apologizes, giving Rod his business card. The prank goes awry when a neighbor's scarecrow is set on fire, leading to Summerhayes questioning Dean about the incident. Summerhayes suggests the World River merger, and Dean proposes that the trio impersonate Ricky Stanicky to present the idea. They agree and travel to Atlantic City, where they meet Rock-Hard Rod (John Cena), an actor and impersonator who sings sex-based parodies of popular songs. During their stay, they learn that Rod legally changed his name to Richard Barbara Stanicky and is grateful for the opportunity he was given.\n\nOn their flight back, the trio turns off their phones, posts something as 'Ricky,' and write in their Bible of Ricky Stanicky, detailing all of what 'Ricky Stanicky' has done. After learning the truth about Ricky, Susan tells JT he has to camp in the backyard for six months as punishment. Dean and JT are angry as this is more than what they made. Shortly after, Dean learns that Susan went into labor six weeks early, forcing them to hurry back. Dean and JT spend time with Ricky, and Rod reveals that he is thankful for being given a new life and tells Dean that Carly is now his fiancée. They plan to work on cleaning the environment on the weekend.\n\nSummerhayes is impressed when Ricky displays his knowledge of Ted's upcoming merger with World River. Ted also notices Ricky and becomes excited. He eventually promotes Ricky as he believes Ricky tells him the truth. Failing to put out the fire, Dean writes the name 'Ricky Stanicky' on their costume piece, leading police to believe that Ricky Stanicky, an out-of-town kid, was responsible for the prank. Erin and Susan encourage Dean and JT to spend more time with Ricky. At the Bris, Rod impresses everyone with his personality and knowledge, including Leona, Carly (Erin's cousin), and Ted Summerhayes (William H. Macy). \n\nErin reveals that she is pursuing a story on Ricky and his alleged humanitarian efforts. Summerhayes reveals that in preparation for their merger with World River, a major company from San Francisco, he has hired Ricky Stanicky for $250,000 per year to advise on the World River deal. Summerhayes starts a charity organization per Ricky's suggestion, making Ricky the head of the World River merger, replacing Dean. Summerhayes also introduces Dean at a party, who confesses to all the guests that Ricky Stanicky is fake, apologizing and promptly leaving the party. Wes has been using the Ricky gig to score alone time for himself (at the pot milk farm) away from his partner Keith (Daniel Monks).\n\nDuring the circumcision of Whitaker, Rabbi Greenberg has a reaction to the Ketamine, leaving Whitaker half-circumcised, and Rod wakes up with no memory of the prank. Summerhayes, impressed with Ricky, decides to start a charity organization, making Ricky the head of the World River merger, replacing Dean. Dean and JT plan to get Ricky fired to get him out of their lives, and Rod is hired to play Ricky Stanicky. Dean becomes depressed, as he is going to lose his job and relationship with Erin once Ricky is proven to be a fraud. Rod is a major mooch, and soon the friends tire of him and want to be rid of him. Ted realizes that nobody listens to a word he says as they are distracted by his mannerisms on stage. \n\nIn the credits, videos and pictures are shown with Ricky and others, and Dean and JT continue to use the 'Ricky Stanicky' story as an excuse to avoid life obligations and get out of trouble.

He rents some space in a barn owned by retired teacher Eloise Parker, a widow who owns and lives in the house on the property. While they both live alone, the two are friendly with one another -- Clay sees Eloise as the only person who ever took care of him. While checking some things on her laptop computer, Eloise sees a warning about two viruses in the system. She calls the number on the screen, and connects to a call center that's located in Springfield, Massachusetts, not aware that it's a phishing scam. The call center's manager, Mickey Garnett, cons Eloise out of everything -- including more than $2,000,000 that's in the account of Safe Homes Foundation, a children's charity whose account she manages. Devastated by the realization that she got scammed out of so much, Eloise shoots herself in the head. Adam finds Eloise's body in her house, and he's immediately arrested by Eloise's daughter, Boston-based FBI Special Agent Verona Parker, who hastily accuses Adam of shooting Eloise. Verona learns that Eloise was scammed out of every penny she had. Adam is quickly cleared when Eloise's death is ruled a suicide because there was no gunshot residue on Adam, and Eloise's fingerprints were the only prints on the gun. Verona apologizes to Adam for her accusation, and she tells him that the FBI cyber-crimes office has told her that the scammer crew that victimized Eloise has been operating for two years, but the FBI hasn't been able to identify any of the scammers. Verona vows to find the scammers, but Adam, enraged by what happened, decides to hunt down the scammers himself, and make them pay for what they did to Eloise. Upon learning the hard way that Adam is after them, Garnett explains the situation to the crew's ringleader, 28-year-old tech executive Derek Danforth, who runs a Boston-based corporation called Danforth Enterprises. Derek assigns the company's head of security, former CIA director Wallace Westwyld, to find a way to stop Adam. But Wallace learns that Adam is a retired member of a classified program called the Beekeepers, whose members are tasked with fighting different forms of corruption, operating above and beyond governmental jurisdiction. The Beekeepers are so efficient and well-trained that they make the military look like a joke. Wallace realizes that Adam is a man who should be feared by people like Derek.

    "ground_truth":"In 1992, a young girl, Rebecca Summers, goes out to her family pool one night to retrieve a toy boat belonging to her terminally ill brother, Tommy. While she tries to get the boat, something in the pool pulls her underwater. In the present day, the Waller family-Ray, Eve, and children Izzy and Elliot-are seeking a new, permanent residence after Ray has been forced to retire from his baseball career due to illness. They decide to purchase a house with a swimming pool in the backyard, especially after hearing that the pool would be good for Ray's condition. Ray scratches his hand while working to clear out the pool in the back yard. When the pool maintenance come to inspect it, they reveal that the pool is essentially self-sustaining, taking its water from an underground spring in the area. As he spends more time in the pool as part of his therapy, Ray's illness seems to go into remission. However, Eve becomes concerned at the changes she sees in her husband. Izzy and Elliot each get attacked by something in the pool, and the family cat goes missing. During a pool party, their realtor, Kay, tells Eve about the previous owners' daughter Rebecca Summers drowning in the pool shortly before Ray seemingly forces a child underwater and almost drowns himself, although this is attributed to a side-effect of his illness. Tracking down the Summers family after learning that there is a long history of disappearances in the house, Eve meets with Lucy, Rebecca's mother. Lucy explains that the water that now sustains the pool was once part of a healing spring, but in order to use the water someone else must be sacrificed to it; Lucy was compelled to sacrifice Rebecca to the pool's entity to heal Tommy's illness. Eve is horrified to realize that Ray is now being healed by the pool but it will take one of the children as a sacrifice. Eve returns to the house to find that Ray is being directly controlled by the entity, which traps Elliot in the pool and attempts to kill Izzy.

Eve manages to retrieve an unconscious Elliot, and is guided to the surface of the pool by Rebecca's spirit. Once back in the yard, Izzy's assault and Elliot's condition help Ray regain control of himself. To stop the entity attacking his children, Ray sacrifices himself to it. Deciding to remain in the house so that no one else falls victim to the entity, Eve, Izzy and Elliot make arrangements for the pool to be filled in to stop such a thing happening again.",

    "ground_truth":"It is 28 years since the world prevented its extinction by a rogue AI android known as Harlan. Atlas Shepherd an analyst who shares a mysterious past with this Harlan is the only person who can find it. Atlas uses Harlan's captured number two Casca to discover its whereabouts, and convinces General Boothe to let her join the mission to capture or destroy it. Though she's viewed as unstable, General Jake Boothe her strongest supporter is in charge of the military program that is tasked with capturing the AI, which everyone is sure will return to wipe out humanity. Shepherd is assigned to a company of 'Rangers.' She is introduced to an ARC. It is provided as means of both attack and defense in battle and offers its operator a great deal of protection. The operator rides within the ARC and together they are a fighting team. The ARC is an AI which Shepherd does not trust because of her past with Harlan. It tells her its name is Smith and she must wear a link that will connect her brain with its processor. Smith tries to convince Shepherd that she must trust it implicitly so they can synchronize their systems and operate as one - combining her analytical skills with its vast database and warehouse of weapons. How does a person capture an AI like Harlan that's always one step ahead?. To succeed, Atlas must learn to trust Smith, another AI, despite her innate distrust for it. They travel to Andromeda in the Dhib - a heavily armed ship capable of intergalactic travel which has been equipped with carbon bombs that can destroy anything. But, it's all been a ploy by Harlan to gain possession of the Dhib and its weapons to return to Earth an annihilate the population.

The two have sex, but Mack is disappointed to find that he only considers her a one-night stand. She convinces Adam to help her ensnare Nick. The foursome research Nick’s habits and preferences, eventually devising a play called ‘The Flurry’. The plan begins with Mack intentionally running into Nick, but ignoring him, attracting his attention. After finding out that he is going on a third date with another girl, the group - having also recruited the paper’s secretary Ashley - schemes to call his date away with an emergency, allowing Mack to take his place.

Nervous about dealing She convinces Adam to run a play with her at brunch, who reluctantly agrees but cautions her to take the relationship more seriously.

Before Artist leaves, he recommends that she contacts Love Addicts Anonymous; she is hesitant at first but eventually joins a group session and shares her story ('Broken Like Me'). During her session, she tells the therapist about a dream she recently had that follows her through their childhood neighborhood in the Bronx. As she leaves in the morning for therapy, Mike, a member of her friend group, invites her to his wedding; given his cynical take on love, the invitation bewilders her. In a dream, she encounters a younger version of herself and apologizes through tears for abandoning their needs, causing her heart to be fully restored ('This Is Me Now'). Now in the present, Artist shares her dream with her therapist. She reflects on their story in the dream where she finds herself enjoying a motorcycle ride with her biker lover, but to no avail. With the help of factory workers, she attempts to prevent her heart from breaking by using the age-old myth as a central guide ('Hearts and Flowers').",
    "filtered_answer":"<PLOT_SUMMARY>\nAlida and Taroo, an ancient Puerto Rican legend about two star-crossed lovers from feuding tribes, has greatly influenced Artist's opinions on love and romance. The therapist moves on to discuss Artist's abusive relationship with a Libra; she is convinced by astrology that they are a good fit, but her friends are concerned for her well-being ('Rebound'). Joe interrupts her for time in therapy, and she defends her reputation as a hopeless romantic. In a dream, she finds herself enjoying a motorcycle ride with her biker lover, but they suffer a severe crash that leaves Artist's heart ruptured, prompting the therapist to question the origin of her poor romantic decisions. The Zodiacal Council, composed of 10 of the 12 astrological signs, is alarmed by how quickly Artist is going through her relationships and worried about the gossip that is emerging as a result. Artist burns old love letters and childhood memories, and a hummingbird, found in Alida and Taroo, furiously knocks on her window.

    "ground_truth":"Kabir Rishi, a chartered accountant, and his wife Jyoti reside in Dehradun, Uttarakhand with their kids Janhvi and Dhruv. On a vacation to their farmhouse at a remote hill station, they meet an enigmatic man, Vanraj Kashyap. After eating a laddu Vanraj gives her, Janhvi obeys his every command like a puppet. Vanraj arrives at the farmhouse, claiming that his phone's battery has died. The family is unsettled by his presence and Kabir asks him to leave. Janhvi, upon Vanraj's orders, prevents her father from kicking him out. Vanraj reveals that he has hypnotised her through black magic; she will obey every command he gives. He asks them to give her to him, as he needs their permission to do so. When they refuse, Vanraj cuts the phone lines and torments the family by dictating Janhvi to do strange and cruel things, such as hitting herself, eating dry tea leaves, and attacking her brother. When police respond to a call from Jyoti's hidden cellphone, the family acts normal to prevent Janhvi from causing an explosion in the house. Kabir offers money in exchange for sparing them but Vanraj sets the money on fire, declaring that he has no use for materialistic things; he reveals himself to be a demon who aims to control the world, believing himself to be as good as God. He then requests her to dance for him; he then goes to sleep, instructing Janhvi to stab anyone who approaches. When her father tries to steal Vanraj's phone, Janhvi urinates in her shorts to stop him so she does not have to stab him. Vanraj wakes up and becomes very disappointed at this and as a result he asks her to undress herself and change her clothes. Having had enough and seeing Jhanvi naked, Kabir and Jyoti attack Vanraj. He orders Janhvi to laugh herself to death and reveals that even if he is killed, Janhvi will continue acting on his last order until her death. This compels Kabir to let him go, but Vanraj instructs Janhvi to kill her brother. He survives her attempt, though grievously wounded when Jhanvi throw him from the terrace. Realising their children might actually die, Kabir and Jyoti give him permission to take Janhvi. Jyoti drives Dhruv to the hospital while, unbeknownst to Vanraj, Kabir trails him to his lair, having fixed a tracker in his cellphone earlier. It is revealed that Vanraj has kept 108 other girls similarly hypnotised. With Janhvi as the last addition, he prepares to sacrifice them. This will complete the ritual for him to acquire the power to control anyone at will, as he believes humans do not deserve free will. Kabir cuts Vanraj's tongue off; when the girls try to kill him, he plays an edited recording of Vanraj's voice, in which he declares their freedom. Earlier, Kabir had taken the home's security camera recording of Vanraj speaking to Janhvi, then spliced his words together to make it seem like Vanraj is ordering the girls to go back to normal. Thus, the girls are freed from his control. As Kabir and his family recuperate at the hospital, Vanraj's hostages are safely returned to their homes by the police who inform Kabir that Vanraj has gone missing. A year later, Kabir is seen going down into an isolated chamber, where he has, in fact, held Vanraj captive. He mocks Vanraj, who can no longer speak, for wanting power and states that true power comes from parents, who can go to any extent to protect their children. He declares that this is hell now and he is Vanraj's devil. He then tells Vanraj that they will meet again the next day and leaves while Vanraj continues to suffer.",

    "ground_truth":"In 2006, a group of 10 friends from an arts club in Kochi leave on a trip to Kodaikanal in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu, during the Onam vacation. They explore Kodaikanal and before leaving, one of the friends, Sudhi tells them about Guna Caves, a place where the film Gunaa was shot. Inebriated, high and happy, the friends reach Guna Caves and decide to explore the restricted areas of the caves by themselves despite a warning from Dominic, a tourist guide. Though there are signs of a lurking danger, the friends explore further. Upon reaching a point, a few friends decide to etch down their group name ‘Manjummel Boys’ on the rocks within the cave. After etching it on the wall, the friends call out to show the remaining guys who are exploring on the other sides to take a picture and they all regroup. Subhash, one of the friends, falls into a covered hole in the ground while moving towards them. Initially everyone assumes he is pulling a prank, but as he does not respond even after calling out to him multiple times, they all start to panic. After the initial shock, a few of them run back to get help and others stay and continue calling out to him in hopes that he would respond. They inform the locals of what happened and ask them for help, and they all suggest going to the police station and forest guard. The locals also inform them that the specific area was off-limits to people for a reason and that so far 13 people have fallen into that hole and none were ever recovered, dead or alive. They mention that the British had called Guna Caves as The Devil's Kitchen due to this reason and that the particular hole is over 900 feet deep. Scared even more, the friends reach the local police station, where they are beaten; the police file an FIR against them for entering a restricted area. They are also accused of murdering Subhash and giving false complaints and no help is offered. Meanwhile, rain starts to flood the hole. Finally after being convinced, and fearing backlash from the local people for failing to help, one of the police officers agrees to go with them to the cave. On the way, he informs them that the last person who fell into the hole was the former Central Minister's nephew around ten years ago and all the forces had gotten together to rescue him, but no one had been able to. The police officer, after inspecting the hole, suggests that they leave Subhash as he probably is no longer alive, but the friends are adamant about rescuing him. But soon one of the boys, Sixen hears Subhash's cries and informs others that he is alive and the police are also convinced to try and save him. The fire department and more police officers are also called into the scene.They estimate that Subhash has fallen down into a depth of around 120 feet. They try lowering the rope, for Subhash to hold, but are sceptical that he may not be in a situation to hold on to the rope after a deep fall. They are scared to go inside the hole to retrieve him. Seeing this, one of the friends, Siju David, decides to go down. The police officers are initially reluctant, but finally agree after being convinced by the friends and the locals. Kuttan is lowered into the hole, but along the way, the rope with which Kuttan is lowered runs out, and police are worried that it is unsafe to go any lower as there might be low oxygen levels, and they are not willing to risk Kuttan’s life as well. However, Kuttan states that he can hear Subhash's voice clearly and that he cannot leave him down there. The police arrange for more rope and reel Kuttan down further. At 120 feet, Kuttan is able to see Subhash barely lying on a ledge covered in blood and muddy water due to the rain. Kuttan is able to retrieve him and the rest of the friends pull them up together successfully. After receiving first aid from the nearest clinic, they take Subhash to the hospital in their hometown, where he is treated more thoroughly. They decide not to tell anyone about the incident and tells Subhash's family that he fell in a waterfall. Subhash suffers trauma from the fall and is not able to sleep initially, but slowly starts recovering after going to trauma therapy. Later, the news that Kuttan saved Subhash comes out from a person who went to Tamil Nadu and Kuttan is applauded for his bravery. 2 years later Kuttan is awarded the Jeevan Raksha Padak for his actions.",

    "ground_truth":"Geeta Sethi, Jasmine Kohli, and Divya Rana are flight attendants with Kohinoor Airlines in Mumbai, which is on the verge of bankruptcy. The staff have not been paid their salaries in months, and the three friends, like all the other employees, keep hoping that things will change. Geeta's husband, Arun, runs a struggling food business from home. She has to financially support her unemployed brother, Punnu, and his wife, Sapna, as well. Jasmine was raised by her maternal grandfather after her parents divorced. She does not believe in relationships, is fond of expensive things, and flaunts a fake and flashy lifestyle on social media. Divya is trained to be a pilot but is forced to take up the job of a flight attendant due to a lack of openings and keeps this hidden from her family as well as struggling to repay her education loan. The death of senior flight attendant Rajvanshi, while on duty, leads Geeta, Jasmine and Divya towards a clandestine operation to smuggle gold out of India to the Middle Eastern country, Al Burj. Manoj Mittal, the HR Head of Kohinoor Airlines, is the kingpin of the operation. The three of them become part of the gold smuggling operation and their financial situation soon improves: Geeta funds Arun’s food business, along with helping Punnu and Sapna. Jasmine gets back Nanu’s gold ring from the pawn shop and splurges on herself. Divya repays her education loan fully. Meanwhile, the other employees of the airline are still trying to make ends meet. Someone tips off the customs officials that the three flight attendants are smuggling gold; and even though the three of them hide the stash, the detention that follows makes them feel humiliated and rethink their choice. The enraged customs official, SI Mala, mentions that her tip is accurate which she received from an air hostess within Kohinoor, and cannot come to terms with the fact that she could not recover any gold.

    "ground_truth":"An Indian convoy carrying a deadly weapon is ambushed and the soldiers guarding it are killed in the process. The perpetrator is a masked man who leaves a message for the Indian Army telling them that he has stolen their weapon and they will have to race against time in order to prevent the destruction of India. Captain Misha meets an agent in Shanghai who warns her about the same before he gets killed by another masked attacker. Misha chases after him and gets into a fistfight, impaling him with a sharp weapon. However, the man's wounds heal instantly and he flees the scene. Misha reports to Colonel Azad and explains how the attacker's wounds healed magically. Azad tells her to keep it a secret and instructs her to enlist court martialed soldiers Firoz (Freddy) and Rakesh (Rocky) for the mission. Misha meets the duo and while Rocky agrees to accompany her, Freddy refuses, feeling that his job got him nothing but disrespect in the end. Misha and Rocky arrive in London and meet an IT Specialist named Parminder aka Pam, who is assigned to assist them in the mission. Azad also arrives in London, but gets shot by the masked villain. Meanwhile, the team infiltrate a London Subway in order to retrieve the stolen package. Just as the team is cornered and nearly defeated, Freddy arrives and fights off the masked men. Pam unlocks the vault and it is revealed that the package is actually a woman named Priya, who was once engaged to Freddy. Since the hard drives were at the risk of being hacked or falling into wrong hands, the codes to a highly advanced defence system named Karan Kavach were encrypted inside Priya's brain. However, the masked man and his army take Priya hostage and following a sustained chase, the group are cornered and the masked man reveals himself as Kabir, a former friend of the duo. He also reveals the nearly immortal masked men were none other than the duo's clones. In a flashback, it is revealed that Kabir intended to help the Indian armed forces with the help of his latest invention: a cloning program where clones based on Freddy and Rocky's DNA could be programmed with orders by Azad and win wars without being killed. However, when he revealed his intentions to conquer the world using this invention, Azad reprimanded him in front of everyone and ordered him to shut down the program since it would go against ethics. Feeling betrayed, Kabir decided to switch sides and sell the invention to India's enemies. Priya alerted the team about the plan, and Freddy and Rocky were ordered to destroy the program and capture Kabir alive. However, they ended up killing him and were court-martialed for not following orders, after which Freddy broke off his engagement with Priya. However, Kabir reveals that he survived because it was actually his clone Eklavya, whom he loved like a son, that was killed and his death left Kabir traumatised and vengeful. Back to the present, Kabir reveals that he has cloned Azad and kills the real one. He kidnaps Priya and leaves Freddy and Rocky to die. The duo manage to kill Kabir's henchmen and return to the base where they reveal to the team that since India has never initiated any of the wars it has participated in, Kabir plans to turn Pakistan and China against India by deactivating the Karan Kavach and launching airstrikes against the two countries, eventually causing India's reputation to be tarnished globally. Freddy, Rocky, Misha and Pam infiltrate Kabir's base where the latter decrypts the password from Priya's brain. Freddy and Rocky fight off Kabir's army, and eventually face off against their own clones, who keep rejuvenating due to an internal power source. Pam suggests destroying them using a high amount of electricity, and the duo kills all the clones by luring them into a power grid, causing them to explode. Kabir launches the airstrikes before Freddy and Rocky fight him off and kill him by impaling him on a spear. Amid failed password attempts, Priya awakens and suggests using ‘Eklavya’, the name of Kabir's own clone. It works and the Karan Kavach is reactivated, averting the airstrike and a potential war. The team reunites and leaves the base, while Kabir awakens and is revealed to be alive.",

Meanwhile, the team infiltrate a London Subway in order to retrieve the stolen package. Amid failed password attempts, Priya awakens and suggests using ‘Eklavya’, the name of Kabir's own clone. Misha reports to Colonel Azad and explains how the attacker's wounds healed magically. Priya alerted the team about the plan, and Freddy and Rocky were ordered to destroy the program and capture Kabir alive. Freddy and Rocky fight off Kabir's army, and eventually face off against their own clones, who keep rejuvenating due to an internal power source. Azad tells her to keep it a secret and instructs her to enlist court martialed soldiers Firoz (Freddy) and Rakesh (Rocky) for the mission. Freddy, Rocky, Misha and Pam infiltrate Kabir's base where the latter decrypts the password from Priya's brain. Azad also arrives in London, but gets shot by the masked villain. An Indian convoy carrying a deadly weapon is ambushed and the soldiers guarding it are killed in the process. In a flashback, it is revealed that Kabir intended to help the Indian armed forces with the help of his latest invention: a cloning program where clones based on Freddy and Rocky's DNA could be programmed with orders by Azad and win wars without being killed. The team reunites and leaves the base, while Kabir awakens and is revealed to be alive. The perpetrator is a masked man who leaves a message for the Indian Army telling them that he has stolen their weapon and they will have to race against time in order to prevent the destruction of India. The duo manage to kill Kabir's henchmen and return to the base where they reveal to the team that since India has never initiated any of the wars it has participated in, Kabir plans to turn Pakistan and China against India by deactivating the Karan Kavach and launching airstrikes against the two countries, eventually causing India's reputation to be tarnished globally. However, Kabir reveals that he survived because it was actually his clone Eklavya, whom he loved like a son, that was killed and his death left Kabir traumatised and vengeful. Misha chases after him and gets into a fistfight, impaling him with a sharp weapon. He also reveals the nearly immortal masked men were none other than the duo's clones. Kabir launches the airstrikes before Freddy and Rocky fight him off and kill him by impaling him on a spear. Misha meets the duo and while Rocky agrees to accompany her, Freddy refuses, feeling that his job got him nothing but disrespect in the end. It works and the Karan Kavach is reactivated, averting the airstrike and a potential war. Misha and Rocky arrive in London and meet an IT Specialist named Parminder aka Pam, who is assigned to assist them in the mission. Captain Misha meets an agent in Shanghai who warns her about the same before he gets killed by another masked attacker."

    "ground_truth":"At the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, the Indian national football team faces a major defeat against Yugoslavia with a score of 10-1. The members of the All India Football Federation blame the coach Syed Abdul Rahim for the team's underperformance. Rahim requests for permission to form another team with new players. The members of the federation are reluctant, especially Subhankar, but he receives support from President Anjan, who grants him permission. Rahim then scouts for players from all over India and forms a new team consisting of Tulsidas Balaram from Secunderabad, Peter Thangaraj from Hyderabad and P. K. Banerjee and Chuni Goswami from Calcutta among others. Roy Choudhary, an influential journalist from Calcutta holds a grudge against Rahim, as he has formed the team with very less number of players from Calcutta. At a party organized for the new team, Rahim and Roy Choudhary have a bitter exchange, where they humiliate each other. At the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, the Indian team prepares to play against Australia. A player from the Australian team disrespects Neville D'Souza and makes him tie his shoes. Neville goes on to score a hat-trick and the Indian team wins the match with a score of 7-1, leaving the Australian team in shock. The Indian team eventually secures the fourth position at the Olympics. Meanwhile, Roy Choudhary and Subhankar plan to remove Rahim from the federation and make Subhankar the President. At the 1960 Summer Olympics the Indian team is pitted against France, which is considered the best team in the world. The match draws with a score of 1-1 and the Indian team fails to qualify. The federation removes Rahim as coach for the Indian team on the grounds that the team has failed to give a good performance for a long period of time. Rahim also learns that he has developed lung cancer due to his excessive smoking and will not live long. Rahim decides to spend his remaining days at home with his family and has frequent coughing fits. His wife, Saira, motivates him, telling him to not give up and pursue his dream of leading the Indian team to win a gold medal. Rahim requests the federation to let him coach the team again and promises that if the team does not win a gold medal, he will not coach any team again in his life. Subhankar, who is now President, initially refuses but has to give in to his request as the other members of the federation give their votes to let Rahim coach the team, given the even poor performance of the team since the time Rahim was removed as coach. Rahim begins to coach the team again and prepares them for the 1962 Asian Games in Jakarta. However, the Finance Ministry refuses to let the Indian team participate in the competition, given insufficient funds. Rahim personally speaks with the Finance Minister Morarji Desai and requests to let the team participate, explaining its significance. The Minister agrees, given the condition that only a selected few players will be allowed to go for the competition. Rahim agrees to it and decides to take only 16 best players from the team and leave out the rest, including his son Hakim, who had also begun to play for the team. Thangaraj, the team's goalkeeper is injured before their first match and is replaced by Pradyut Barman, which weakens the team. In their first match, the Indian team is pitted against South Korea and they face defeat, with the teammates blaming one another for their poor performance. After the match, Rahim makes them understand the importance of formation and coordination. In their next match against Thailand, Jarnail Singh, a player from the Indian team is gravely injured by an opponent. Rahim instructs the Indian team ‘to make them pay for it’ and they go on to play more aggressively, winning the match with a score of 4-1. An Indian diplomat publicly criticises the decision of not allowing Israel and Taiwan to play in the competition, which angers the people of Indonesia, leading to massive public protests against the Indian team. On the day of the final match, where the Indian team would play against South Korea, the team bus is attacked by protesters and the military is brought in to provide security for them. Rahim's health deteriorates and he begins coughing up blood, but still motivates the team by delivering an inspiring speech. On seeing Rahim's determination, Roy Choudhary has a change of heart and starts supporting the Indian team. Thangaraj and Singh also rejoin the team for the match. The Indian team goes on to win the match with a score of 2-1, winning the gold medal at the Asian Games.",
