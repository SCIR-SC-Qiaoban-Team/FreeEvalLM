The crumbling, graffiti-covered buildings are overgrown with creepers. The only human visitors to the 70-acre site in Vaimaanga pay a small fee to explore what has become known as the biggest white elephant in the South Pacific. The Italian-backed hotel project, which began in the late 1980s, was designed to revolutionise tourism in the remote Cook Islands by providing the tiny nation with its first five-star resort. But the house of cards collapsed at the 11th hour, with the project 80% complete, amid allegations of mafia involvement and money laundering back in Italy. The Cook Islands government was left with a debt of $120m and was almost bankrupted. In the years since, repeated attempts to finish the project have foundered, but now a new effort to salvage the buildings is under way, and could have an even bigger impact on the tiny Pacific state than the original plans were expected to. Tim Tepaki, a Cook Islander who has been involved in property development in New Zealand, claims to have hundreds of millions of dollars in Chinese backing. He hopes to rebuild the complex and turn the Pacific backwater into a favourite destination for tourists from China. Until now tourism in the Cooks – a nation of 15 islands scattered across an area the size of India – has relied mainly on visitors from Australia and New Zealand, who tend to focus on the capital Rarotonga and the atoll of Aitutaki, a 50-minute flight north.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"<<Rarotonga's Abandoned Sheraton Hotel: From Curse to Resurrection?>>\nHalf-submerged in a jungle and surrounded by livestock, the long-abandoned Sheraton hotel complex in Rarotonga, a South Pacific island, has become a minor tourist attraction. The project, launched in the late 1980s to modernize tourism in the Cook Islands, was intended to provide the small nation with its first five-star resort. However, the venture was halted at a critical stage due to allegations of mafia involvement and money laundering in Italy, leading to severe debts for the government. Despite numerous failed attempts to complete the project in the following years, a new investor, Tim Tepaki, claims to have significant Chinese backing for a revitalization plan that could significantly boost tourism in a nation primarily dependent on visitors from Australia and New Zealand.\n\n***\n\nThe derelict site of the Sheraton complex, covering 70 acres, now draws visitors curious about its tragic history and mysterious nature. Overgrown with creepers and filled with graffiti, the buildings stand as a testament to the ambitious yet failed dream of transforming the Cook Islands. The current plan, driven by Tepaki's Chinese-backed investment, aims to rebuild the resort and position it as a favorite tourist destination, potentially drawing more visitors from China and substantially changing the economic landscape of this remote group of 15 islands across a vast area equivalent to the size of India.\n\n***\n\nThe future of the Sheraton complex is uncertain, but the potential for economic transformation is significant. If the plan succeeds, it could revolutionize not just the tourism industry but also the fiscal stability of the Cook Islands, a nation that has struggled with debt and financial instability. Tepaki's efforts represent a new chapter in the story of the abandoned resort, one that could bring prosperity to a remote corner of the Pacific, turning it into a destination of choice for travelers seeking an exotic and culturally rich experience.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Pauline Hanson has likened the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, to a “spoilt brat” for ruling out a deal with One Nation. Arriving in Bundaberg just as the Labor campaign left, Hanson, who remains the most visible One Nation asset in Queensland, despite not running in Saturday’s state election, lashed out at Palaszczuk’s continued criticism of the party. Palaszczuk’s insistence that Labor would rather go into opposition than form government with One Nation has become its strongest attack line against the Liberal National party, which is directly preferencing One Nation in 50 of the 61 seats it is running in, as well as admitting, indirectly, it would form government with One Nation, if necessary. The opposition leader, Tim Nicholls, who has previously said he would work with the parliament Queenslanders delivered, was unable to answer “yes or no” to the question of whether he would form government with One Nation on Tuesday during a radio quiz, instead opting for “pass”. Hanson has responded with the line that the major parties are choosing not to respect the will of the people, in the same way Donald Trump’s campaign used Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment against the Democrat campaign last year. “I don’t think the premier knows what she is doing actually, I think she is in such a turmoil over this and she is actually needs to get out of the sandpit and be the leader for this state,” Hanson said. “Because the way she is carrying on, it is not leadership, it is not quality. “To say you won’t work with One Nation, it is just ridiculous. It’s like a spoilt brat, she is carrying on like a spoilt kid, and if that is what leadership means then I think she is heading down the wrong path and Tim Nicholls, he needs to grow up and make a decision, because people want clear decision in this state.

In a company memo, obtained by the Hollywood Reporter, Lasseter writes that he has fallen short in creating a culture that engenders “support and collaboration” and hints at behavior that he has been confronted about. “I’ve recently had a number of difficult conversations that have been very painful for me,” he writes. “It’s never easy to face your missteps, but it’s the only way to learn from them. As a result, I’ve been giving a lot of thought to the leader I am today compared to the mentor, advocate and champion I want to be. It’s been brought to my attention that I have made some of you feel disrespected or uncomfortable. That was never my intent.” Lasseter, who is one of the founders of Pixar and the director of Toy Story, also apologizes for letting employees down while adding more details about the conduct that has led to him taking a sabbatical. “I especially want to apologize to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form,” he writes. “No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.” In a statement, a Disney spokesperson responded: “We are committed to maintaining an environment in which all employees are respected and empowered to do their best work. We appreciate John’s candor and sincere apology and fully support his sabbatical.” The memo has arrived at the same time as an investigation by the Hollywood Reporter into complaints about Lasseter’s behavior.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

In a company memo, obtained by the Hollywood Reporter, Lasseter writes that he has fallen short in creating a culture that engenders “support and collaboration” and hints at behavior that he has been confronted about. “I’ve recently had a number of difficult conversations that have been very painful for me,” he writes. “It’s never easy to face your missteps, but it’s the only way to learn from them. As a result, I’ve been giving a lot of thought to the leader I am today compared to the mentor, advocate and champion I want to be. It’s been brought to my attention that I have made some of you feel disrespected or uncomfortable. That was never my intent.” Lasseter, who is one of the founders of Pixar and the director of Toy Story, also apologizes for letting employees down while adding more details about the conduct that has led to him taking a sabbatical. “I especially want to apologize to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form,” he writes. “No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.” In a statement, a Disney spokesperson responded: “We are committed to maintaining an environment in which all employees are respected and empowered to do their best work. We appreciate John’s candor and sincere apology and fully support his sabbatical.” The memo has arrived at the same time as an investigation by the Hollywood Reporter into complaints about Lasseter’s behavior.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Australia’s race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, says the high no vote in western Sydney in last week’s historic same-sex marriage postal survey reflects religious observance rather than ethnicity, and he has warned against an outbreak of crass, cultural stereotyping. Soutphommasane used a speech at the University of Western Sydney to issue a pointed warning against adopting “easy narratives” devoid of evidence about the behaviour or inclinations of particular ethnic groups in Australia. “In a world that many describe as post-truth or post-factual, our social cohesion is not always well served by jumping to conclusions,” he said. “Once-appealing narratives take hold, they can help fuel stereotypes about others – and these can be difficult to shake off. Sometimes this is because they may conveniently help to confirm cultural hierarchies in our society.” Soutphommasane said a narrative has sprung up since the postal survey which centres on ethnic minorities or multicultural communities being intrinsically hostile towards same-sex marriage, and to the LGBTI community at large. He said while some ethnic communities hold to the view that marriage is between a man and a woman, that view is shaped often by religious or cultural traditions. The race commissioner said a more clear-eyed examination of the postal survey data suggests religiosity, or religious observance, was a more significant factor for no voters – a fact well understood by the no campaign, which targeted messages to a range of communities in Sydney’s west. Soutphommasane said if you look at the voting trends outside western Sydney, a more mixed picture emerges – a picture where seats with populations of more than 40% born overseas overwhelmingly voted yes. He pointed out that the most multicultural electorates in New South Wales and Victoria recorded high yes votes – seats like Sydney, Grayndler, Kingsford Smith, Bradfield, Batman, Wills, Gellibrand and Chisholm. “To suggest that an overwhelming majority of multicultural communities voted no – and did so out of some essential cultural hostility against gays and lesbians – is to entertain something that comes close to an unkind stereotype,” the race commissioner said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Thousands of miles away in Beijing – for years Mugabe’s most powerful backer – there were no obvious signs of jubilation. “China respects Mr Mugabe’s decision to resign,” foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters, praising his “historic contribution” to Zimbabwe’s liberation. “He remains a good friend of the Chinese people.” But experts believe China’s leaders will be both relieved and contented to see the back of “Comrade Bob” – a suspicion reinforced by the approving tone coverage of his demise has taken in the Communist party-controlled press. “We need change in our country,” China’s official news agency Xinhua – whose correspondents’ dispatches are expected, above all else, to reflect the party line – quoted one Zimbabwean teacher as saying of Mugabe’s resignation. “We’re very happy,” another Zimbabwean told party mouthpiece the People’s Daily. “Finally things will change.” Ross Anthony, an expert in China-Africa relations from South Africa’s Stellenbosch University, said that while Beijing had backed Mugabe since his days as a Marxist revolutionary in the 1970s, it had increasingly seen him as erratic, an embarrassment and a threat to Chinese investments. A case in point was Mugabe’s controversial indigenisation law, which required all foreign companies to be controlled by Zimbabweans and was a particular blow to Chinese interests in its diamond industry. “I imagine there are quite a lot of officials in Beijing who will be happy to see Mugabe go,” Anthony said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Confirmation of Robert Mugabe’s ouster prompted revelry on the streets of Harare. “The Goblin has gone!” raved one. Thousands of miles away in Beijing – for years Mugabe’s most powerful backer – there were no obvious signs of jubilation. “China respects Mr Mugabe’s decision to resign,” foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters, praising his “historic contribution” to Zimbabwe’s liberation. “He remains a good friend of the Chinese people.” But experts believe China’s leaders will be both relieved and contented to see the back of “Comrade Bob” – a suspicion reinforced by the approving tone coverage of his demise has taken in the Communist party-controlled press. “We need change in our country,” China’s official news agency Xinhua – whose correspondents’ dispatches are expected, above all else, to reflect the party line – quoted one Zimbabwean teacher as saying of Mugabe’s resignation. “We’re very happy,” another Zimbabwean told party mouthpiece the People’s Daily. “Finally things will change.” Ross Anthony, an expert in China-Africa relations from South Africa’s Stellenbosch University, said that while Beijing had backed Mugabe since his days as a Marxist revolutionary in the 1970s, it had increasingly seen him as erratic, an embarrassment and a threat to Chinese investments. A case in point was Mugabe’s controversial indigenisation law, which required all foreign companies to be controlled by Zimbabweans and was a particular blow to Chinese interests in its diamond industry. “I imagine there are quite a lot of officials in Beijing who will be happy to see Mugabe go,” Anthony said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Patients are being put at risk because doctors are giving them drugs they do not need and sending them for unnecessary surgery to avoid a complaint being made against them, research has revealed. Medics are so scared of being complained about that they are also giving patients more tests than their symptoms merit and not performing procedures that involve more risk than usual. Four out of five doctors who become the subject of a complaint find the experience so stressful that they start practising more “defensive medicine” than before, according to a survey of 6,144 doctors in Britain about whom a patient, relative or colleague had complained. “This involved ‘hedging’, which includes performing more tests than necessary, over-referral and overprescribing as well as ‘avoidance’, which includes avoiding procedures, not accepting high-risk patients or abandoning procedures early,” according to research by a team led by Prof Tom Bourne of Imperial College London, whose findings have been published in the journal BMJ Open. “These behaviours may have a serious impact on patient care,” they warned. While litigation, complaints and investigations are intended to protect patients from poor care and medical negligence, the “burden and stress associated with these processes are clearly having unintended consequences and it may be argued that when examined as a whole, these structures may be causing more harm to patient care than good,” the study said. “While the regulatory system may protect patients from the misconduct of a relatively small number of doctors, it has a perverse effect on the majority of doctors who become preoccupied by defensive practice,” it added. Doctors who resort to “fear-driven working practices that could compromise patient care” also waste vital resources and their conduct “creates significant costs for the NHS”, the co-authors added. Bourne could not quantify how much NHS spending goes on that, but pointed to a study that found such practices accounted for 10% of Italy’s health budget. The General Medical Council, which regulates Britain’s 250,000 doctors, receives 9,000-10,000 complaints a year.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"<<Risk in Healthcare>>\n\nSECTION 1\nThe research highlights a concerning trend in healthcare, where doctors are increasingly practicing \"defensive medicine\" out of fear of patient complaints and regulatory scrutiny. This behavior, described as \"hedging\" and \"avoidance,\" involves unnecessary tests, over-prescribing, and avoiding high-risk procedures, significantly impacting patient care. While the regulatory system aims to protect patients from negligence, it unintentionally encourages stress and resource wastage, particularly due to the 9,000-10,000 complaints the General Medical Council handles annually.\n\nSECTION 2\nThe impact on patient care is severe, and the study's authors warn of potential harm resulting from this practice. They suggest that while the regulatory framework is crucial for addressing misconduct, the overall burden on doctors and the NHS is a critical issue. The co-authors emphasize that \"fear-driven working practices\" could compromise patient care, leading to substantial costs for the NHS. A related study found that \"defensive medicine\" accounted for 10% of Italy's health budget, underscoring the financial implications of these practices.\n\n***\n\nRegarding the keywords ['due', 'green', 'storm', 'tackle', 'tonight'], they do not seem directly relevant to the content provided from the Guardian article. However, they could be incorporated into a hypothetical scenario or related context not provided in the source material. For instance, \"Due to the pending green storm, environmental agencies are tonight tackling the issue of over-prescribing in healthcare to address its environmental and economic impacts.\" Clearly, these words would need to fit into a broader narrative that is beyond the scope of the original article.",

While the regulatory system aims to protect patients from negligence, it unintentionally encourages stress and resource wastage, particularly due to the 9,000-10,000 complaints the General Medical Council handles annually.\n\nSECTION 2\nThe impact on patient care is severe, and the study's authors warn of potential harm resulting from this practice. They suggest that while the regulatory framework is crucial for addressing misconduct, the overall burden on doctors and the NHS is a critical issue. The co-authors emphasize that \"fear-driven working practices\" could compromise patient care, leading to substantial costs for the NHS. A related study found that \"defensive medicine\" accounted for 10% of Italy's health budget, underscoring the financial implications of these practices.\n\n***\n\nRegarding the keywords ['due', 'green', 'storm', 'tackle', 'tonight'], they do not seem directly relevant to the content provided from the Guardian article. However, they could be incorporated into a hypothetical scenario or related context not provided in the source material. For instance, \"Due to the pending green storm, environmental agencies are tonight tackling the issue of over-prescribing in healthcare to address its environmental and economic impacts.\" Clearly, these words would need to fit into a broader narrative that is beyond the scope of the original article.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Nick Xenophon Team senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore will resign from the Senate because she has dual British citizenship by descent through her mother. At a press conference in Adelaide on Wednesday, Kakoschke-Moore announced she had received advice from the UK Home Office on Friday, confirmed by a specialist barrister, that she had received British citizenship from her mother, who was born in Singapore in 1957. Kakoschke-Moore had always believed she was not British because her father had received advice from the British embassy in Oman she was not eligible for citizenship when she was 12. She said she was “heartbroken” to discover she was British, which she described as “extremely surprising” because she “had no reason to believe I was a British citizen until that point”. Kakoschke-Moore explained that her mother was born in Singapore, a former British colony, which gave her “citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies” and became a British citizen in 1983 when the British Nationality Act came into effect. Kakoschke-Moore, born in Darwin in 1985, then gained that citizenship by descent. Kakoschke-Moore said she would request the matter be referred to the high court to determine how the vacancy would be filled, adding she would “continue to run” for the NXT and “at this stage” her ambition was to come back to the Senate. A recount of the 2016 Senate election would likely elect the NXT candidate Tim Storrer, who unsuccessfully attempted to replace Xenophon in the Senate by challenging the party’s chosen successor. Xenophon said he and his colleagues were “devastated” by the loss of Kakoschke-Moore from the Senate, but predicted it was “not the end of her political career”. Xenophon said the party had preliminary legal advice the position may not be filled by a recount, claiming the situation was “uncharted legal territory” because of the high court’s recent decision involving Hollie Hughes.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

They are deprived of faith. They are suffering.” Taulam said no government seemed willing to take care of the men who remain in the centre. “Australia seems to be saying, ‘Papua New Guinea, this is your responsibility’.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Late last year, the Electoral Commission started an investigation into a striking set of circumstances. In February 2016 Steve Baker MP, lobbying for Vote Leave to be designated the “official” leave campaign, sent a round robin email asking recipients to support it, because it claimed to have found a loophole in the spending rules. “It is open to the Vote Leave family to create separate legal entities each of which could spend £700k: Vote Leave will be able to spend as much money as is necessary to win the referendum,” he wrote. But Baker – now a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) – got it wrong. The law that protects our democracy from capture appears to make this behaviour illegal: when a sockpuppet signs your cheques, the spending still counts as yours. The Electoral Commission knew about Baker’s email – it was reported in the Times. But despite knowing that Vote Leave appeared to have contemplated acting unlawfully, the Electoral Commission went ahead and designated it as the official leave campaign. Then we come to the referendum campaign. With under a month to go, Vote Leave was bumping up against the limits of what it could lawfully spend. But it had plenty of money left over from wealthy donors.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.  Wrap your entire response with double quotation marks.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Late last year, the Electoral Commission started an investigation into a striking set of circumstances. In February 2016 Steve Baker MP, lobbying for Vote Leave to be designated the “official” leave campaign, sent a round robin email asking recipients to support it, because it claimed to have found a loophole in the spending rules. “It is open to the Vote Leave family to create separate legal entities each of which could spend £700k: Vote Leave will be able to spend as much money as is necessary to win the referendum,” he wrote. But Baker – now a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) – got it wrong. The law that protects our democracy from capture appears to make this behaviour illegal: when a sockpuppet signs your cheques, the spending still counts as yours. The Electoral Commission knew about Baker’s email – it was reported in the Times. But despite knowing that Vote Leave appeared to have contemplated acting unlawfully, the Electoral Commission went ahead and designated it as the official leave campaign. Then we come to the referendum campaign. With under a month to go, Vote Leave was bumping up against the limits of what it could lawfully spend. But it had plenty of money left over from wealthy donors.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.  Wrap your entire response with double quotation marks.

The UNHCR also revealed accommodation for the refugees and asylum seekers is still not fully constructed, more than three weeks after the detention centre was officially closed and Australia’s immigration minister Peter Dutton said community housing was ready for detainees. It came as Papua New Guinea police and immigration deferred a joint operation to “politely” request the men to leave the centre ahead of a supreme court appeal case on Wednesday afternoon. The police commissioner, Gari Baki, said Operation Helpim Friends, was on hold pending the outcome of the case, filed on behalf of the refugees and asylum seekers. He earlier pledged the operation – assisted by the paramilitary police mobile squad – would use no force, but refugees “will be asked politely to pack up and voluntarily leave the centre”. Nai Jit Lam, UNHCR’s deputy regional representative in Canberra, made the comments from Manus Island in a briefing to the UN Palais des Nations in Geneva. Lam told the international community the situation on Manus was “very serious and deteriorating by the day”. About 380 men are inside the former detention facility without food, running water or medical care, saying they fear for their safety in the Lorengau community. There have been frequent attacks on detainees and well-documented tensions with locals.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The former Liberal minister Philip Ruddock has been appointed to examine if Australian law adequately protects the human right to religious freedom. Ruddock’s appointment by cabinet, announced on Wednesday, is designed to head off a bruising debate about religious amendments in a same-sex marriage bill, but the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the review was “no substitute” for those amendments. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said it was important to look at the issue of religious freedom carefully, in light of the yes vote and impending legislation on marriage equality. While senior conservatives including Peter Dutton and Mathias Cormann have publicly suggested a religious freedom bill can be considered next year, separately to a marriage bill, others including Morrison and Liberal senator, David Fawcett, have insisted it be considered at the same time. Ruddock has been asked to report by 31 March. Turnbull said a variety of proposals for legislative changes to protect freedom of religion have been put forward in recent months but many of them go beyond the immediate issue of marriage, and parliament needed to be wary of them. “Any reforms to protect religious freedom at large should be undertaken carefully,” he said in a statement on Wednesday. “There is a high risk of unintended consequences when parliament attempts to legislate protections for basic rights and freedoms, such as freedom of religion. The government is particularly concerned to prevent uncertainties caused by generally worded bill of rights-style declarations. “This will be a timely expert stocktake to inform consideration of any necessary legislative reforms.” Turnbull said Ruddock was the right person to conduct the review because he had served as Australia’s special envoy for human rights.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"Former Liberal minister Philip Ruddock has been appointed to examine whether Australian law sufficiently protects the human right to religious freedom. This appointment, made by the cabinet on Wednesday, aims to avoid a contentious debate over religious amendments in a same-sex marriage bill. Treasurer Scott Morrison noted, however, that the review is not intended to replace these amendments. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull emphasized the importance of carefully assessing the issue of religious freedom in light of the recent yes vote in the marriage equality referendum and upcoming legislation. Senior conservatives advocate for a religious freedom bill to be considered separately from the marriage equality bill, but others, including Morrison and Liberal Senator David Fawcett, argue it should be addressed concurrently. Ruddock is tasked with reporting by March 31, with Turnbull stressing the need for careful legislative reforms. He noted that any attempts to legislate protections for basic rights, such as freedom of religion, could lead to unforeseen consequences, and that a general bill of rights-style declaration might cause uncertainty. ***\n\nThe primary goal of Ruddock's review is to preempt a difficult debate by ensuring that religious freedoms are adequately protected within the framework of a same-sex marriage bill. Given the sensitivity of this political issue, the government views Ruddock's expertise as crucial for addressing the complexities involved. The appointment indicates a cautious approach by the government, aiming to balance the interests of religious freedom with the broader context of marriage equality. ***\n\nTurnbull's statement underscores the government's commitment to a measured and cautious approach in legislating for religious freedom, highlighting the risks associated with overly broad language in legislative proposals. The prime minister's concerns over potential unintended consequences suggest a desire to proceed with well-considered reforms rather than rush into legislation without careful deliberation. ***\n\nWhile some conservative members of the cabinet, such as Peter Dutton and Mathias Cormann, favor considering a religious freedom bill separately from the marriage equality legislation, more moderate voices within the government, including Morrison and Fawcett, advocate for a simultaneous approach. This internal debate reflects the political complexities surrounding the issue and highlights the need for a balanced view in formulating any legislative changes. ***\n\nOverall, the appointment of Ruddock reflects the government's intention to navigate the delicate balance between protecting religious freedoms and advancing marriage equality, ensuring that legislative changes are carefully crafted to avoid broader unintended consequences. The review process will serve as a critical step in determining the necessary reforms and maintaining the delicate equilibrium between these competing interests. ***",

The appointment indicates a cautious approach by the government, aiming to balance the interests of religious freedom with the broader context of marriage equality. ***\n\nTurnbull's statement underscores the government's commitment to a measured and cautious approach in legislating for religious freedom, highlighting the risks associated with overly broad language in legislative proposals. The prime minister's concerns over potential unintended consequences suggest a desire to proceed with well-considered reforms rather than rush into legislation without careful deliberation. ***\n\nWhile some conservative members of the cabinet, such as Peter Dutton and Mathias Cormann, favor considering a religious freedom bill separately from the marriage equality legislation, more moderate voices within the government, including Morrison and Fawcett, advocate for a simultaneous approach. This internal debate reflects the political complexities surrounding the issue and highlights the need for a balanced view in formulating any legislative changes. ***\n\nOverall, the appointment of Ruddock reflects the government's intention to navigate the delicate balance between protecting religious freedoms and advancing marriage equality, ensuring that legislative changes are carefully crafted to avoid broader unintended consequences. The review process will serve as a critical step in determining the necessary reforms and maintaining the delicate equilibrium between these competing interests. ***",

The goalkeeper, who spent three successful years on loan at Atlético Madrid after joining Chelsea from Genk, has been an integral part of the team who have won two Premier League titles in the past three seasons.

    "response":"The text provided appears to be an ironic and satirical excerpt from a news article in The Guardian, likely describing a fictional cooking show or celebration. It is a whimsical blend of unexpected food pairings, costumes, and dialogue, hinting at an annual event focused on cooking and culinary creativity. The article is filled with exaggerated descriptions that twist traditional cooking norms into an absurd spectacle.\n\nThe \"Deathless celebration of all things banter, forged in vinaigrette and molten moccasin\" suggests that the show combines cooking techniques with energetic, lighthearted banter among participants. It's not described as a formal event, but rather one where creative spirits gather to share their humorous and unconventional cooking ideas.\n\nOne particularly absurd scene is set \"Hours of: Scallops in chino runoff. Steak in Lynx Sport Blast® reduction.\" Both descriptors are comically nonsensical, blending mismatched ingredients and fashion accessories in a way that hints at a surreal and imaginative approach to cooking.

    "filtered_answer":"The text provided appears to be an ironic and satirical excerpt from a news article in The Guardian, likely describing a fictional cooking show or celebration. It is a whimsical blend of unexpected food pairings, costumes, and dialogue, hinting at an annual event focused on cooking and culinary creativity. The article is filled with exaggerated descriptions that twist traditional cooking norms into an absurd spectacle.\n\nThe \"Deathless celebration of all things banter, forged in vinaigrette and molten moccasin\" suggests that the show combines cooking techniques with energetic, lighthearted banter among participants. It's not described as a formal event, but rather one where creative spirits gather to share their humorous and unconventional cooking ideas.\n\nOne particularly absurd scene is set \"Hours of: Scallops in chino runoff. Steak in Lynx Sport Blast® reduction.\" Both descriptors are comically nonsensical, blending mismatched ingredients and fashion accessories in a way that hints at a surreal and imaginative approach to cooking.

Two of her best and most memorable works, which reveal her father’s influence, are a striking self-portrait from 1954, and a 1957 portrait of Stanley himself. She had three solo shows of her paintings in London, and contributed to many mixed exhibitions, from the London Group to the Royal Academy shows. The first of her one-person shows was at Lauderdale House in Highgate, in 1993, the second at the Boundary Gallery in St John’s Wood in 2001, both in north London, but it was the third that really established her reputation. In 2015, the Fine Art Society in Bond Street mounted the first West End exhibition of her work, to coincide with the publication of her autobiography, Lucky to Be an Artist. Fifty of her paintings from all periods were shown along with her etchings, accompanied by a group of pictures by her family: works by her parents, her uncles Gilbert Spencer and Richard Carline, and by her grandfather George Carline. This show came at the suggestion of a friend, the painter David Inshaw. He recalled visiting her house in Clapham (where, according to her son, she had inscribed “Daring, Joy and Love” on her bedroom wall), expecting to find it hung with paintings by herself and her parents. But the walls were oddly bare, with not even her own work in sight.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Traditional cider makers have warned they will be unfairly penalised by a tax on super-strength cider, as the rest of the drinks industry toasted the budget freeze on alcohol duty. The chancellor unveiled plans, including a new duty band on still cider and perry with an alcohol content between 6.9% and 7.5%, in a move the Treasury said was aimed at “white cider”. White cider is often cited as a particular problem for alcoholics and homeless people because it is cheap but strong. But traditional cider makers, some with decades of history in the craft, warned that they would be caught up in legislation that might not even have the desired effect. Arfur Daley, of the family-run Gwatkin Cider, in Herefordshire, said: “It won’t affect the larger cider makers. But the more artisanal cider makers it will affect. I’d like to see an exception if you’re using whole fruit. Larger cider makers use concentrate, but everything we make is from the apples.” Neil Worley, managing director of Worley’s Cider, in Somerset, said that while small producers could suffer, white cider firms could still sell cheap high-strength drink. “They will just reformulate to 6.9%,” he said. “At £3.50 a bottle the price would be 15.5p a unit and at 6.9% it’s 16.9p per unit, so the difference is negligible.” But the plans also drew criticism from larger white cider firms, such as Aston Manor Cider, whose 7.5% Frosty Jack’s brand costs £3.59 for a three-litre bottle in the shop Iceland.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Traditional cider makers have warned they will be unfairly penalised by a tax on super-strength cider, as the rest of the drinks industry toasted the budget freeze on alcohol duty. The chancellor unveiled plans, including a new duty band on still cider and perry with an alcohol content between 6.9% and 7.5%, in a move the Treasury said was aimed at “white cider”. White cider is often cited as a particular problem for alcoholics and homeless people because it is cheap but strong. But traditional cider makers, some with decades of history in the craft, warned that they would be caught up in legislation that might not even have the desired effect. Arfur Daley, of the family-run Gwatkin Cider, in Herefordshire, said: “It won’t affect the larger cider makers. But the more artisanal cider makers it will affect. I’d like to see an exception if you’re using whole fruit. Larger cider makers use concentrate, but everything we make is from the apples.” Neil Worley, managing director of Worley’s Cider, in Somerset, said that while small producers could suffer, white cider firms could still sell cheap high-strength drink. “They will just reformulate to 6.9%,” he said. “At £3.50 a bottle the price would be 15.5p a unit and at 6.9% it’s 16.9p per unit, so the difference is negligible.” But the plans also drew criticism from larger white cider firms, such as Aston Manor Cider, whose 7.5% Frosty Jack’s brand costs £3.59 for a three-litre bottle in the shop Iceland.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['background', 'battle', 'look', 'purchase', 'wall'] in the response. There should be 3 paragraphs. Paragraphs and only paragraphs are separated with each other by two new lines as if it was '\\n\\n' in python. Paragraph 2 must start with word bother.",
    "response":"Traditional cider makers have expressed concerns over an impending tax on super-strength cider, highlighting the potential unfairness of the measure. The background of the dispute centers on the Treasury's decision to introduce a new duty band on still cider and perry with an alcohol content between 6.9% and 7.5%. Bothered by this, traditional cider makers argue that the legislation may not address the intended issues and could disproportionately affect smaller, artisanal producers while larger manufacturers may navigate the changes more easily by simply reformulating their products.\n\nBother Arfur Daley of Gwatkin Cider and Neil Worley of Worley’s Cider have expressed specific concerns about the impact of the new tax. Daley emphasized that the policy would significantly affect smaller, family-run cider makers who rely on whole fruit rather than apple concentrate. Worley noted that incorporating new legislation could subtly increase the unit price for smaller providers, making it challenging for them to compete. Meanwhile, larger producers could potentially circumvent the new duty by reformulating their products to maintain their current pricing and unit costs.\n\n\\n\\nTraditional cider makers seem to be looking at a challenging new landscape, where smaller producers may face purchase barriers from increased costs and regulatory hurdles while larger producers might adapt more swiftly. The wall of change that the tax on super-strength cider represents could create a significant divide within the industry, threatening smaller artisans and tradents who contribute uniquely to cider's cultural and historical tapestry.",

    "response":"The article begins with a humorous anecdote about an ambulance crew's experience, highlighting how social media can amplify even the most mundane moments. The incident occurred when an ambulance crew arrived to assist a critically ill patient who was vomiting blood. Upon pulling up to the scene, they noticed that the windscreen of their vehicle had been marked with a note that read, \"You may be saving lives, but don't park your van in a stupid place and block my drive.\" This note came to the attention of the crew after a colleague posted a tweet featuring the message, which went viral.\n\nThe crew quickly realized that they were not the only ones who had encountered this issue. One of the team members had observed people waiting outside to receive the patient, and could tell from the expression of a man that he was very concerned. The paramedics understood that speed was of the essence in this emergency situation. They knew they had to be prepared to act swiftly and needed to ensure they were in the best possible position to treat the patient immediately.\n\nGiven the critical nature of the patient's condition, the team took a proactive approach and instructed their colleague to get a stretcher. The note reminded them of the importance of not parking in such a way that could hinder their ability to provide prompt medical assistance. They usually maintained a calculated approach to parking, but in an emergency like this, they needed to balance this with the necessity to know the situation before positioning the vehicle more strategically.\n\nThe scene at the property was challenging. The road was already double-parked, which added to the complexity of maneuvering the ambulance. The crew also had to consider the potential impact of not blocking the driveway. However, the crew's primary focus was on the patient's immediate needs. They had to work within the constraints of the parking situation and prioritize the safety and accessibility for their response. In some circumstances, they might have backtracked 200-300 metres to find a more suitable location, but given the severity of the patient's condition, they decided to proceed with their original position, albeit with caution.\n\nThe viral nature of the note reflected a broader societal concern about ambulance protocol and the impact of their vehicles on local traffic and property access. It sparked discussions about the public's understanding of the importance of ambulances and emergency services. While the note was lighthearted in tone, it underscored a genuine issue that many ambulances face, particularly in densely populated urban areas.\n\nThis incident serves as a reminder of the often-tenuous balance between the swift provision of medical care and the logistical challenges that emergency responders must navigate. The viral tweet also highlighted the public's desire to be informed and involved in discussions around emergency services, even in such mundane scenarios. It prompted reflection on the ways in which social media can both amplify and bring attention to issues that might otherwise go unnoticed.\n\nThe story encapsulates the high stakes and high-pressure environment in which ambulance crews operate, and how even small issues can become significant due to the emotive nature of emergency situations. It also hints at the potential for misunderstandings or tensions between emergency services and the public they serve, which can sometimes be addressed through open dialogue and public awareness campaigns.\n\nIn conclusion, the viral note serves as a chapter in the broader narrative of emergency response, touching on issues of public perception, logistical challenges, and the rapid evolution of public discourse through social media. Any other questions?",

    "response":"<<Care Home Costs and the Myth of Local Authority Funding>>\n\nYour article inaccurately presents the financial obligations of self-funders in care homes. Contrary to what was stated, local authorities (LAs) do not simply \"pick up the tab\" when a person’s assets reach £23,250. Instead, LAs follow a sliding scale where they take £1 for every £250 of capital until the person's assets reach £14,250. At this point, the individual may retain any remaining assets. However, this relief is not the end of financial contributions, as local authorities continue to claw back contributions from pensions, both state and private, and expect families to provide top-up payments as well.\n\n***\n\nMy mother's experience with a nursing home is a clear illustration of the significant financial burden faced by self-funders. With severe dementia and residing in a care home for over four years, she had to sell her two-bedroom flat and exhaust her savings, having already paid over £250,000. The escalating costs due to the privatization of care homes, combined with the high demand, demonstrate how quickly a person's resources can be depleted. This situation often necessitates the involvement of local authorities when resources are exhausted, leading to further complications and additional pressures on the individual and their family.\n\n***\n\nAnother critical issue highlighted is the promotion of investment in UK care homes by international newspapers, promising an 8% return on investment. This not only underscores the financial risk for potential investors but also reflects a broader challenge: the market-driven pricing in care homes that can exacerbate financial distress for self-funders. The privatization trend in care homes, where there is no upper limit on what they can charge for services, highlights the systemic issues that need addressing to improve affordability and accessibility.",

Born into a broken home, Toney faced a tumultuous upbringing, his father resorting to violence, including shooting Toney's mother at gunpoint when he was only one year old. This traumatic event was the seed of a dark period in his life, leading to his involvement with crime, where he carried a gun and sold crack cocaine.

The Metropolitan police said on Wednesday they were looking into the fresh claims against the Hollywood actor, having opened an investigation into similar allegations against him earlier this month. According to the latest allegations, Spacey sexually assaulted a man, identified only as Victim 2, in 2005. The claims were referred to the Met by City of London police last Friday, Scotland Yard said. The earlier claims related to an alleged sexual assault perpetrated against a man identified as Victim 1 in 2008 and were referred by the same force. Each was allegedly committed in the Lambeth area of south London and, in each case, police refused to name the suspect. However, officers did confirm that each was made against the same man and he is understood to be Spacey. “Officers from the child abuse and sexual offences command are investigating,” the Met said on Wednesday. Spacey has faced a series of accusations of sexual misconduct in the US and the UK. Last week, the Old Vic theatre, where he was artistic director from 2003 to 2015, said it had been contacted by 56 people with 20 individual allegations of inappropriate conduct, including some allegedly perpetrated against former staff.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

According to the latest allegations, Spacey sexually assaulted a man, identified only as Victim 2, in 2005. The claims were referred to the Met by City of London police last Friday, Scotland Yard said. The earlier claims related to an alleged sexual assault perpetrated against a man identified as Victim 1 in 2008 and were referred by the same force.

However, officers did confirm that each was made against the same man and he is understood to be Spacey. “Officers from the child abuse and sexual offences command are investigating,” the Met said on Wednesday. Spacey has faced a series of accusations of sexual misconduct in the US and the UK.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n At this stage in her career, no one expects Björk’s latest record to sound much like her last one. And yet it’s hard to avoid heaving a thankful sigh when Arisen My Senses, the opening track of her ninth studio album, Utopia, crashes into life: birdsong giving way to bright splashes of electronics, beatific-sounding harp chords and cascading beats not unlike the oft-sampled rhythm track of Schoolly D’s old rap classic PSK, What Does It Mean? It sounds positively ecstatic, which comes as a relief. Utopia’s predecessor, 2015’s Vulnicura, was a remarkable record, a latterday entry into the canon of legendary break-up albums. It attained its place alongside Marvin Gaye’s Here, My Dear and Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks by setting its fathomless misery to atonal string arrangements and abstract electronics that, during its central track, kept vanishing into a single flatlining beep. It was raw, brave, challenging, unique and all the other adjectives heaped on it in reviews, but with the best will in the world, any album so harrowing that the appearance of gloom-laden vocalist Anohni constitutes a moment of light relief is going to be one that defies you to listen to it repeatedly. Utopia reanimates Vulnicura’s collaboration with Venezuela-born electronic auteur Arca, but is made of lighter material. Aside from his endlessly shifting soundscapes, distorted beats and penchant for sonic tapestries made from manipulated vocal samples, the album’s primary sound is woodwind, provided by an assembly of 12 female flautists from Reykjavik, which automatically lends it a far airier quality than the claustrophobic Vulnicura. It is, Björk says, her “Tinder album”, and its advance billing as a kind of Songs for Swinging Bachelorettes is borne out by its lyrics, which are obsessed both with technology and the vicissitudes of budding romance. “Is this excess texting blessing?” ponders Blissing Me, the saga of “two music nerds … sending each other MP3s”, before reverting to grief: “our physical union a fantasy, I just fell in love with a song”.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Hammond’s colleagues used the first of four days of scheduled debate about the budget to praise not just his high-profile announcements on housing, but also his commitment of £3bn to prepare for any Brexit eventuality. In his response to the budget, Corbyn – it is the leader of the opposition who traditionally speaks rather than the shadow chancellor – said Hammond had completely failed to tackle a national crisis of stagnation and falling wages. “The test of a budget is how it affects the reality of people’s lives all around this country,” the Labour leader said. “And I believe as the days go ahead, and this budget unravels, the reality will be – a lot of people will be no better off. And the misery that many are in will be continuing.” Largely eschewing direct focus on Hammond’s specific announcements in favour of a broader critique of the government’s wider economic approach, Corbyn castigated Hammond for again missing deficit reduction targets, and for a continued spending squeeze on schools and the police. Speaking about housing, Corbyn said rough sleeping had doubled since 2010, and that this Christmas 120,000 children would be living in temporary accommodation. “We need a large-scale publicly funded housebuilding programme, not this government’s accounting tricks and empty promises.”Summing up, he said: “We were promised a revolutionary budget.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Ships and planes hunting for an Argentinian submarine that went missing in the south Atlantic a week ago are to return to a previously searched area as relatives of those onboard voiced their frustrations with rescue efforts. An Argentinian navy spokesman, Captain Enrique Balbi, said search teams would return to the area about 30 miles north of the ARA San Juan’s last registered position after a “hydro-acoustic anomaly” was determined by the US and specialist agencies to have been produced just hours after the final contact with the submarine on 15 November. “It’s a noise. We don’t want to speculate” about what caused it, Balbi said. With the seven-day limit on the ARA San Juan’s oxygen reserves having been reached on Wednesday morning, what hopes that remain are pinned on the submarine having been able to replenish its oxygen supply by surfacing at some point during the past week. Helena Alfaro was just one of many family members who congregated at the Mar del Plata naval base where the submarine was originally scheduled to arrive on Monday. “I feel like I’m waiting for a corpse,” said Alfaro, the sister of Cristian Ibañez, a radar officer on the missing submarine. “So much protocol, so much protocol,” she complained to TN news network, referring to the Argentinian navy’s long delay in advising the president, Mauricio Macri, that it had lost contact with the submarine. Justifying the delay, navy chiefs said that military protocol advises a 48-hour waiting period before beginning search efforts for submarines lost at sea. “I feel like I’m at a wake, that’s how I feel,” said a tearful Alfaro.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

An Argentinian navy spokesman, Captain Enrique Balbi, said search teams would return to the area about 30 miles north of the ARA San Juan’s last registered position after a “hydro-acoustic anomaly” was determined by the US and specialist agencies to have been produced just hours after the final contact with the submarine on 15 November. “It’s a noise. We don’t want to speculate” about what caused it, Balbi said. With the seven-day limit on the ARA San Juan’s oxygen reserves having been reached on Wednesday morning, what hopes that remain are pinned on the submarine having been able to replenish its oxygen supply by surfacing at some point during the past week. Helena Alfaro was just one of many family members who congregated at the Mar del Plata naval base where the submarine was originally scheduled to arrive on Monday. “I feel like I’m waiting for a corpse,” said Alfaro, the sister of Cristian Ibañez, a radar officer on the missing submarine. “So much protocol, so much protocol,” she complained to TN news network, referring to the Argentinian navy’s long delay in advising the president, Mauricio Macri, that it had lost contact with the submarine. Justifying the delay, navy chiefs said that military protocol advises a 48-hour waiting period before beginning search efforts for submarines lost at sea. “I feel like I’m at a wake, that’s how I feel,” said a tearful Alfaro.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

It didn’t deal in black humour in the latterday manner of Human Remains or Nighty Night – there was sharp, witty writing, slapstick humour, it dabbled in farce – but equally, there was no mistaking the way every episode was shot through with wistfulness, nostalgia and regret.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n England are pencilled in to play Ireland in Dublin next autumn under the auspices of a new Six Nations tournament to increase the strength of northern hemisphere rugby league. The tournament is provisionally on the Rugby League International Federation’s calendar and would comprise the same participants as rugby union’s Six Nations in 2018. Of those six, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France and Italy were eliminated in the group stages of the current Rugby League World Cup, while England face Tonga in a semi-final on Saturday. Richard Egan, the chairman of Rugby League Ireland, told the Guardian: “The provisional RLIF fixtures at the minute show that there is a Six Nations next year. It’s unconfirmed at the minute, though, and that’s where I have issues in developing the sport here. “In other sports you can buy tickets years in advance but I can’t guarantee what fixtures I’ve got to sell next year.” It is unclear when the RLIF plan to announce the details officially, though the tournament should take place in October and November, following the conclusion of the domestic season. However, that clashes with England’s three-Test series against New Zealand next autumn, details of which the Rugby Football League confirmed on Tuesday. That lends weight to the suggestion that the England Knights concept – an emerging talent side similar to union’s England Saxons – may return to play in the tournament. Egan, however, would be keen to see the strongest England side possible travel to Ireland to play in Dublin. He said: “We’re down for a provisional fixture against England in the capital and a game against Italy here, but if it’s an England B team that doesn’t work for me.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

This is the third in the Arkestra’s Reason Why trilogy, and like the two earlier volumes, it features a delightfully weird mix of covers – obscure worldbeat gems, recent indie anthems, dippy psychedelic oddities – each creatively reinvented by a talented nine-piece. A skittery waltz by Ethiopian jazz pioneer Hailu Mergia becomes a slinky piece of horn-led funk, complete with woozy slide guitar; a pulsating piece of Afrobeat by Benin’s Orchestre Poly-Rythmo features an ecstatic free-jazz freakout by tenorist Per “Texas” Johansson; a hymnal reading of Panda Bear’s You Can Count On Me comes wreathed in shards of astral jazz. Like all of Kajfeš’s covers albums, researching the source material will send you down some very rewarding wormholes.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

This is the third in the Arkestra’s Reason Why trilogy, and like the two earlier volumes, it features a delightfully weird mix of covers – obscure worldbeat gems, recent indie anthems, dippy psychedelic oddities – each creatively reinvented by a talented nine-piece. A skittery waltz by Ethiopian jazz pioneer Hailu Mergia becomes a slinky piece of horn-led funk, complete with woozy slide guitar; a pulsating piece of Afrobeat by Benin’s Orchestre Poly-Rythmo features an ecstatic free-jazz freakout by tenorist Per “Texas” Johansson; a hymnal reading of Panda Bear’s You Can Count On Me comes wreathed in shards of astral jazz. Like all of Kajfeš’s covers albums, researching the source material will send you down some very rewarding wormholes.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n New nuclear power stations in the UK can no longer compete with windfarms on price, according to the boss of a German energy company’s green power arm. Hans Bunting, the chief operating officer of renewables at Innogy SE, part of the company that owns the UK energy supplier npower, said offshore windfarms had become mainstream and were destined to become even cheaper because of new, bigger turbines. Asked whether nuclear groups that want to build new reactors in the UK could compete with windfarms on cost, even when their intermittency was taken into account, Bunting replied: “Obviously they can’t.” His comments came after MPs criticised the £30bn cost to consumers for EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and said ministers should revisit the case for new nuclear before proceeding with more projects. Innogy recently secured a subsidy of £74.75 per megawatt hour of power to build a windfarm off the Lincolnshire coast, which is £17.75 cheaper than Hinkley and should be completed about three years earlier. “What we see now [with prices] is with today’s technology. It’s not about tomorrow’s technology, which is about [to come in] 2025, 2027, when Hinkley will most likely come to the grid ... and then it [windfarms] will be even cheaper.” While the company is planning to use the most powerful turbines in the world today for the Lincolnshire windfarm, Bunting said even bigger ones in development would drive costs down further. “A few years ago everyone thought 10MW [turbines] was the maximum, now we’re talking about 15[MW]. It seems the sky is the limit,” he said. “[It] means less turbines for the same capacity, less steel in the ground, less cables, even bigger rotors catching more wind, so it will become cheaper.” However, EDF argued that nuclear was also on a path to lower costs. “Early offshore wind projects started at around £150 per MW\/h and developers have shown they can offer lower prices by repeating projects with an established supply chain – the same is true for nuclear,” an EDF spokesman said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

It’s not about tomorrow’s technology, which is about [to come in] 2025, 2027, when Hinkley will most likely come to the grid ... and then it [windfarms] will be even cheaper.” While the company is planning to use the most powerful turbines in the world today for the Lincolnshire windfarm, Bunting said even bigger ones in development would drive costs down further. “A few years ago everyone thought 10MW [turbines] was the maximum, now we’re talking about 15[MW]. It seems the sky is the limit,” he said. “[It] means less turbines for the same capacity, less steel in the ground, less cables, even bigger rotors catching more wind, so it will become cheaper.” However, EDF argued that nuclear was also on a path to lower costs. “Early offshore wind projects started at around £150 per MW\/h and developers have shown they can offer lower prices by repeating projects with an established supply chain – the same is true for nuclear,” an EDF spokesman said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.
