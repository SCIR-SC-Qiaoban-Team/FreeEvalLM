      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n It was the frog that pushed me over the edge. I’ve never been a Harry Potter fan myself – I was already out of kids’ books when they first came out, and those clever grown-up covers weren’t enough to tempt me back – but I’d always admired JK Rowling from afar. Who wouldn’t? A writer whose imagination transfixed the world, whose riches now exceed those of the Queen, but who has founded a children’s charity, pays her taxes in full, and remains both poised and politically engaged: as role models go, it is hard to think of a better one. So I was pleased when my seven-year-old son went Harry Potter crazy. Having never read to himself before, he was suddenly racing through book after book, his bedside light on late into the night. His brother and several of his friends caught the bug – just as the Suez canal flowed through Clarissa Eden’s drawing room, Hogwarts overshadowed our house, as children constantly dashed about on broomsticks, casting spells and looking for snitches. It was impressive to see the “Harry Potter effect” in action: the magical power that, in the two decades since its first publication, has revitalised the children’s publishing industry, encouraged millions of children to read, sold more than 400m copies across the world, and generated a cultural empire worth £20bn. Less pleasant, however, was the realisation that there was a marketing juggernaut poised to capitalise on my son’s enthusiasm. Unlike those first readers 20 years ago, the children discovering Harry Potter now are immediately faced with a multibillion-pound industry trading in Potter-themed “experiences” and paraphernalia.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Cheyenne Mangold’s hands shook ever so slightly as she reached with a long metal instrument to catch hold of what looked like the cervix. The medical student was attempting, for the very first time, the rudiments of performing an abortion. As she inexpertly brought the pincers together on the soft flesh, you might have expected a little yelp of pain from the patient. There was silence. Not because the “patient” was brave, but because it was a papaya. Mangold was at a special workshop organized by a not-for-profit group whose mission is to make up for the lack of instruction on contraception and abortion at many US medical programs. But it doubled as a lesson in using a no-frills kit of basic instruments that, in the event of the practice becoming illegal in the US, could be stashed and carried discreetly, to perform covert abortions safely.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Cheyenne Mangold’s hands shook ever so slightly as she reached with a long metal instrument to catch hold of what looked like the cervix. The medical student was attempting, for the very first time, the rudiments of performing an abortion. As she inexpertly brought the pincers together on the soft flesh, you might have expected a little yelp of pain from the patient. There was silence. Not because the “patient” was brave, but because it was a papaya. Mangold was at a special workshop organized by a not-for-profit group whose mission is to make up for the lack of instruction on contraception and abortion at many US medical programs. But it doubled as a lesson in using a no-frills kit of basic instruments that, in the event of the practice becoming illegal in the US, could be stashed and carried discreetly, to perform covert abortions safely. And it so happens that the papaya, with its little fruity neck and a central cavity full of seeds and pulp, is a serviceable approximation of a woman’s cervix and womb for the purposes of basic initiation for a medic in training.

He can guess, though: it doesn’t take a genius. “He might not like what I do, but he has the decency not to say so,” admits the chess-playing, beach football international, former manager of Equatorial Guinea (for one night only) and defender of an aesthetic footballing faith who briefly made Las Palmas the best thing in the league and is now at Real Betis, if maybe not for much longer. “He might go: ‘Bloody hell, this bring-the-ball-out thing, I shit on its mother!’ He’s good enough not to say that, but I’m sure he thinks it.” So is everyone else, and more than before. Because if Simeone never told Setién, on Sunday afternoon he showed him. Really, really showed him.

At the same time as he arrived, midfielder Koke stood pitchside. Talking to the telly, Koke’s opening line couldn’t have been clearer: “Betis were spectacular,” he said. “They played very well, they play very nice football.” Antonio Adán, Betis’s goalkeeper, agreed: “The football we played was incredible,” he insisted, “our opponents were truly dominated.” The problem was, a ‘but’ hung in the air and it was a big one.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theresa May has declared that tackling climate change and reducing its effects on poorer countries is a “moral imperative”, as the Conservative party renewed its push to portray itself as environmentally friendly. The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron’s 2005 efforts to show the Tories cared about global warming. Ahead of this week’s climate change summit in Paris, May said: “There is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.” She described coal as “one of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power” and hailed the “enormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents”. May’s commitment to the issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real. However, the prime minister insists “tackling climate change and mitigating its effects for the world’s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces”. At the summit she will announce a £140m boost to funding for poorer communities affected by climate change through deforestation or vulnerability to natural disasters and extreme weather, plus £15m of additional support for reconstruction on Dominica in the Caribbean, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. It comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being asked by party officials to show off their green credentials after internal polling showed the level of concern among younger voters about environmental issues. The party has been alarmed by the backlash against May’s support for a free vote on foxhunting, the omission of a ban on the ivory trade from the manifesto and its lack of support for an amendment that would have recognised in UK law that animals feel pain. They have since backtracked on all three issues.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  At the end of your response, please explicitly add a postscript starting with P.S."

President Bashar al-Assad was on the brink of defeat when Russia entered the conflict in 2015. With sustained airstrikes on both moderate rebel groups and extremists, Moscow has helped Assad win back control of much of the country.

The prime minister made a concession on Monday by agreeing to set up a new committee of MPs to monitor any proposed legal changes as EU legislation is converted into the British statute book. She had been facing a parliamentary defeat over the issue during the debate on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday, after a widespread backbench revolt among remain- and leave-supporting MPs. However, the government has not backed down on its intention to fix the day of Brexit as 29 March 2019 or acceded to the demands of soft Brexit Tory MPs who wanted a meaningful vote on the terms of the final deal before that date. One Conservative rebel said May was in trouble over these two issues because there were enough dissatisfied Conservatives combined with Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and other opposition MPs to defeat the government. The MP said the government and the rebels were currently in a standoff with neither side prepared to back down. However, government sources were confident May had managed to convince enough of her backbenchers not to defy the whip by indicating that a vote was likely to happen well before the date of leaving and promising a second vote on legislation implementing the EU withdrawal agreement hammered out in Brussels on Friday. The appetite for rebellion among Conservative MPs will become clearer during the two days of debate and voting on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday and Wednesday. Up to 25 had threatened to revolt unless May promised more scrutiny over Brexit lawmaking, but No 10’s concessions appear to have allayed concerns among the would-be troublemakers. The government will agree to establish a new committee of MPs to help weed out the overuse of “Henry VIII powers”, which allow ministers to make changes to secondary legislation as it is transposed.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theresa May has been forced to accept more scrutiny of Brexit lawmaking to head off a Tory revolt but is still heading for a showdown over how MPs get to vote on the final deal and whether the date for leaving should be fixed in law. The prime minister made a concession on Monday by agreeing to set up a new committee of MPs to monitor any proposed legal changes as EU legislation is converted into the British statute book. She had been facing a parliamentary defeat over the issue during the debate on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday, after a widespread backbench revolt among remain- and leave-supporting MPs. However, the government has not backed down on its intention to fix the day of Brexit as 29 March 2019 or acceded to the demands of soft Brexit Tory MPs who wanted a meaningful vote on the terms of the final deal before that date. One Conservative rebel said May was in trouble over these two issues because there were enough dissatisfied Conservatives combined with Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and other opposition MPs to defeat the government. The MP said the government and the rebels were currently in a standoff with neither side prepared to back down. However, government sources were confident May had managed to convince enough of her backbenchers not to defy the whip by indicating that a vote was likely to happen well before the date of leaving and promising a second vote on legislation implementing the EU withdrawal agreement hammered out in Brussels on Friday. The appetite for rebellion among Conservative MPs will become clearer during the two days of debate and voting on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday and Wednesday. Up to 25 had threatened to revolt unless May promised more scrutiny over Brexit lawmaking, but No 10’s concessions appear to have allayed concerns among the would-be troublemakers. The government will agree to establish a new committee of MPs to help weed out the overuse of “Henry VIII powers”, which allow ministers to make changes to secondary legislation as it is transposed.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n International affairs Iran nuclear deal, 15 January We should know by mid-January how serious Donald Trump is about seeking a confrontation with Iran over its nuclear programme. The US president refused in October to continue to certify the 2015 multilateral agreement under which Tehran accepted strict curbs on its activities in return for sanctions relief. Trump said that either Congress or US allies should fix the “serious flaws” in the deal, or he would “terminate it. The Senate has since opted out of dealing with the matter, and Washington’s allies have insisted that the 2015 agreement cannot be renegotiated. If Trump refuses to sign a six-monthly presidential waiver due on 15 January, nuclear-related sanctions against Iran will no longer be suspended and the US will be in violation of agreement. The other signatories, including the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China, would then have to decide whether to try to carry on without the US or allow the agreement to collapse. Either way, the Trump administration would have taken a very significant step toward open confrontation. Winter Olympics, 9 February The Winter Olympics in South Korea will be both a festival of sport and a test of the increasingly fragile peace in the region. If the war of words between Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is defused, the Olympics could offer the opportunity for a thaw.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n International affairs Iran nuclear deal, 15 January We should know by mid-January how serious Donald Trump is about seeking a confrontation with Iran over its nuclear programme. The US president refused in October to continue to certify the 2015 multilateral agreement under which Tehran accepted strict curbs on its activities in return for sanctions relief. Trump said that either Congress or US allies should fix the “serious flaws” in the deal, or he would “terminate it. The Senate has since opted out of dealing with the matter, and Washington’s allies have insisted that the 2015 agreement cannot be renegotiated. If Trump refuses to sign a six-monthly presidential waiver due on 15 January, nuclear-related sanctions against Iran will no longer be suspended and the US will be in violation of agreement. The other signatories, including the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China, would then have to decide whether to try to carry on without the US or allow the agreement to collapse. Either way, the Trump administration would have taken a very significant step toward open confrontation. Winter Olympics, 9 February The Winter Olympics in South Korea will be both a festival of sport and a test of the increasingly fragile peace in the region. If the war of words between Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is defused, the Olympics could offer the opportunity for a thaw. Seoul has suggested a lull in joint manoeuvres with the US during the Games, potentially opening the way for dialogue.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The US would then be in breach of the agreement, leaving its allies, including the UK, France, and Germany, to decide how to proceed. \n\nWith a deadline of 15 January, the situation is becoming increasingly tense.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The career of Keith Chegwin, who has died aged 60, is characterised by having presented both one of the most popular children’s TV shows in history and a contender for the medium’s most notorious adult entertainment. Viewers saw the best of him in Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (BBC1, 1976-82) and its successor, Saturday Superstore (1982-87), on which Chegwin became an honorary big brother to several generations of goggle-eyed British children, through his cheeky grin and giggle, high-pitched Liverpudlian-accented enthusiasm, and psychedelic knitwear. His presentational worst occurred when Chegwin threw off the novelty sweaters – and, indeed, all clothing except a hat – to front the naturist show Naked (Channel 5, 2000), described by a parliamentarian at the time as the “most disgusting programme ever shown” on British TV. But, while he should be remembered for the work he did with his jolly jumpers on, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for Chegwin, even in his most desperate televisual enterprises. This was due to a natural likability. Only the most sympathetic TV presenters earn nicknames from viewers, and, just as Bruce Forsyth transmuted into “Brucie”, Chegwin rapidly and indelibly became “Cheggers”. That identity was cemented by the title of the third huge success of his children’s career: the music-based gameshow, Cheggers Plays Pop (BBC1, 1978-86), which extended his presenting empire to weekdays. In less prosperous times, though, audiences also admired the impressive and affecting determination with which Cheggers, in the three decades after his Saturday morning career ended, tried to reinvent himself, often against considerable odds. In addition to a common problem for children’s presenters – becoming too old to maintain the required fantasy-sibling dynamic – Chegwin suffered health problems, including alcoholism. Apart from the established presenter-rehab route of reality TV – appearing on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity MasterChef – Chegwin also offered ironic spins on his showbiz rise and fall in 10 projects, including Ricky Gervais’s Extras and Life’s Too Short, and Kill Keith (2011), an improbable comedy-horror Brit film spoof of Tarantino’s Kill Bill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n A couple of years ago, Hayley Squires decided to get a new tattoo. “I’d been romantically involved with somebody for a little while, and it had driven me a bit nuts,” she explains. “Then he was out of my life, and it was coming up to my birthday.” She kept thinking up various symbols and signs that might mean something, but nothing rang true. Then she remembered this line. It’s a quote from A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and it’s tucked nearly underneath the crook of her left arm. It reads: “And though she be but little, she is fierce.” Squires, 29, is both of those things. She’s also direct, talks a lot, and quickly, and is a genuine laugh, despite her talent for plumbing the depths of despair in the Ken Loach film, I, Daniel Blake. When we meet, she’s wearing a Tupac T-shirt – one of four Tupac T-shirts she owns – and a pilot’s jacket, which she bought because it looked a bit like the one Tom Hardy wears in the film Dunkirk. “Because I’ve got a bit of an obsession with him, I walked into Topshop and saw it and thought: ‘Ahhh!’” she says, smiling. She’s about to star in The Miniaturist, a gorgeous three-part BBC adaptation of Jessie Burton’s bestselling novel, though she almost decided not to go for it at all.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n A couple of years ago, Hayley Squires decided to get a new tattoo. “I’d been romantically involved with somebody for a little while, and it had driven me a bit nuts,” she explains. “Then he was out of my life, and it was coming up to my birthday.” She kept thinking up various symbols and signs that might mean something, but nothing rang true. Then she remembered this line. It’s a quote from A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and it’s tucked nearly underneath the crook of her left arm. It reads: “And though she be but little, she is fierce.” Squires, 29, is both of those things. She’s also direct, talks a lot, and quickly, and is a genuine laugh, despite her talent for plumbing the depths of despair in the Ken Loach film, I, Daniel Blake. When we meet, she’s wearing a Tupac T-shirt – one of four Tupac T-shirts she owns – and a pilot’s jacket, which she bought because it looked a bit like the one Tom Hardy wears in the film Dunkirk. “Because I’ve got a bit of an obsession with him, I walked into Topshop and saw it and thought: ‘Ahhh!’” she says, smiling. She’s about to star in The Miniaturist, a gorgeous three-part BBC adaptation of Jessie Burton’s bestselling novel, though she almost decided not to go for it at all.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"Hayley Squires recently got a tattoo after ending a romantic relationship. She struggled to find a meaningful design but then came across a quote from A Midsummer Night's Dream, which became her choice. The tattoo now appears on her left arm, reading: \"And though she be but little, she is fierce.\" This phrase suits Squires, who is a strong and confident individual. In a personal conversation, she exhibits a direct and talkative nature but can also display a deeper level of emotional depth, as seen in her previous roles. Currently, Squires is set to star in a BBC adaptation of a popular novel, \"The Miniaturist.\" However, there was a point where she considered not taking on the role. She wears Tupac T-shirts often and has a distinctive sense of style.",

Ch Supt Wayne Miller urged this suspect to give himself up immediately, stating that he is fully aware that he is being pursued.\"\n\n*** \n\n\"Following the devastating incident, essential details are still emerging, and caution is being exercised when publicly disclosing them. Despite the suspected arson attempt taking place, police have so far not released any information regarding the possible motives behind the attack. Given the scale of the tragedy, law enforcement officials are working diligently to unravel the complex web of events that led up to this terrible event. Crucial steps must be taken to both safeguard potential witnesses and ensure the stability of those most directly affected, like Michelle Pearson's relatives. Collaborations between Greater Manchester police, regional authorities, and local civil service, will instantly happen.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is to launch plans for an opt-out system of organ donation, asking people to overcome their “fatal reluctance” to discuss the issue with family and friends. Under the plans, everybody in England would be presumed to be happy to donate their organs on their death, unless they have signed up to a register stating that they do not want that to happen. In practice, however, it is unlikely that organs would be taken against the wishes of the family. The government’s ambition to change the NHS organ donation programme was announced by Theresa May in her Conservative party conference speech in October. Last year, she said, “500 people died because a suitable organ was not available. And there are 6,500 on the transplant list today.” NHS Blood and Transplant’s figures show that 1,100 families in the UK decided not to allow organ donation because they were unsure, or did not know whether their relatives would have wanted to donate an organ or not. “Every day, three people die for want of a transplant, which is why our historic plans to transform the way organ donation works are so important. We want as many people as possible to have their say as we shape the new opt-out process,” said Hunt. “As well as changing the law, we also need to change the conversation – it can be a difficult subject to broach, but overcoming this fatal reluctance to talk openly about our wishes is key to saving many more lives in the future.” The consultation will ask three questions: how much say should families have in their deceased relative’s decision to donate their organs? When would exemptions to “opt-out” be needed, and what safeguards will be necessary?\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Answer with less than 271 words.

The Tories have given us a recovery that is worse than the one in the 1930s that followed the Great Depression. And families won’t see any improvement in living standards until 2022. That’s why we should set a new ambition for Britain: to become the world’s leading digital economy. Today there are just 1.5 million jobs in the digital economy. That’s about 4% of the workforce. But here’s the key point: digital jobs pay 40% more than the average wage. That’s more than £190 a week. So transforming the number of digital jobs in our economy is one of the fastest ways we can give Britain a pay rise.

    "filtered_answer":"The glamour of Joan Didion is not about her elevated status or attractive lifestyle. Her enduring allure lies in her willingness to take on new experiences and pursue various endeavors throughout her life. In the documentary \"Joan Didion: The Centre Will Not Hold,\" she comes across as engaging and confident, using her hands expressively when making a point. What really captures one's attention is Didion's diverse range of pursuits, from writing for magazines to screenplays, as well as her decision to have children, showcasing her courage to explore different paths in life.\n\n******\n\nWhat sets Joan Didion apart from others is not her impressive public image or her association with influential people in the film industry. Her alluring presence is rooted in her willingness to step out of her comfort zone and explore various interests and career paths. In the documentary about her life, Didion is portrayed as a charismatic and articulate individual, using her body language to emphasize her points. It's her ability to delve into new areas, from magazine articles to screenplay writing, and her decision to embark on motherhood, that truly make her stand out.\n\n******\n\nIt's worth noting that many of the glamour often associated with Joan Didion is misplaced.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n When Carla Bruni, the Italian-born, French-raised heiress and supermodel quit the catwalk to reinvent herself as a singer-songwriter 20 years ago, many thought it would be short-lived dilettantism. Yet Bruni surprised her detractors, showing herself to be a talented songwriter and a careful, nuanced singer whose jazzy chansons soon topped the French charts. She has continued to do so, even after the inevitable hiatus to her musical career caused by marrying Nicolas Sarkozy, and spending 2008-12 in the Élysée as France’s first lady. She has spoken of suffering from crippling stage fright, but this still-gamine figure, fronting a four-piece, light-jazz band, exudes preternatural poise. Bruni moves with beatific grace, recalling Karl Lagerfeld’s praise of her as “this beautiful creature who can wear anything”; her husky whisper could be a parody of a breathy Gallic siren. Her latest album is a set of cover versions sung in English, French Touch, which is a decidedly mixed bag. It largely works because Bruni pours herself into the songs as if in thrall to them: her pitch-perfect, sparse croon through Depeche Mode’s Enjoy the Silence identifies and amplifies the bleak yearning at the song’s core. The quirky arrangements can be eccentric. Bruni’s cod-jazz take on Willie Nelson’s Crazy veers near to lift muzak, while the jaunty noodling her band introduce to Lou Reed’s Perfect Day sounds at odds with the song’s dark soul. The Clash’s Jimmy Jazz is transformed into a previously unknown genre that can only be described as ethereal boogie-woogie.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Ten-year-old Emily told them a boy at school had slapped her, hard, across the face: “I want to die. Nobody believes me. He’s hitting me and nobody believes me.” “We didn’t know what to do,” Rob tells me, his voice echoing the helplessness and frustration he felt. “Hearing her say those words – what parent wants to hear that from their 10-year-old daughter?” When Claire tried to speak to the school about the incident, they quickly dismissed it as “a misunderstanding”, telling her: “Everyone’s happy now.” But Emily was far from happy. Over the subsequent two weeks, she gradually opened up to her parents with the help of her GP. Slowly, she described how the boy in question had sexually harassed and assaulted her over the past 10 months. It emerged that another child had made a detailed report to the school after witnessing the boy intimidating and assaulting Emily. The classmate had told staff it happened in a corner of the playground known as the “sex corner”, where the boy had forced Emily against a wall, pinning her hands on either side of her as he gyrated and rubbed his body against hers.

However, the film looks set to face strong opposition from Steven Spielberg’s Pentagon Papers drama The Post and Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, at a Globes ceremony that will provide the entertainment industry with its first major opportunity to respond to the sexual abuse scandal plaguing Hollywood. Two months after the emergence of allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein that would prompt a further torrent of claims against men in the film industry, the nominations exhibited an already changed landscape in Hollywood. As expected none of the Weinstein-produced films eligible for inclusion received nominations, however there were multiple nominations for Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World, which was forced to replace star Kevin Spacey at short notice, after he was accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and harassment. At the same time, the widely predicted shift towards a more female-focused list of nominees in the wake of the Weinstein scandal did not materialise. Though there were nods for a number of films with female protagonists, including The Shape of Water, Three Billboards, I, Tonya, a biopic of disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding and coming-of-age comedy-drama Lady Bird, there was no room in the nominees for any female directors, while Patty Jenkins’s feminist superhero movie Wonder Woman was snubbed entirely. Leading the way with seven nominations is the Shape of Water, which stars British actor Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaner at a governmental research facility who falls in love with a captured sea creature. Both Del Toro and Hawkins have been nominated in the drama category, for best director and best actress respectively, while Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer have received supporting actor and actress nominations. The film has also received best screenplay and score nominations, as well as best picture in the drama category.

    "response":"**The Art of Imitation and Innovation**\n\nThe art classroom in Denver, Colorado, is a remarkable place where creativity is born out of imitation.  A bright young art teacher, inspired by the works of Vassily Kandinsky, has devised a unique lesson plan that combines art history with hands-on experimentation.  By having her students imitate the style of Kandinsky's geometric abstractions, she is not only teaching them brushwork and colour theory, but also imparting a valuable lesson about creativity and originality.\n\n**Learning from the Past**\n\nThe concept that creativity arises from derivation and extrapolation suggests that ideas are never entirely new. Instead, they are built upon existing knowledge and concepts.  In this sense, the past is not just a repository of knowledge, but a launching pad for innovation.  By acknowledging the debt we owe to those who have come before us, we can continue to push the boundaries of what is thought possible.  This understanding is at the heart of the art lesson in Denver, where students learn to treat the past as a foundation, rather than a starting point.\n\n**The Power of Imitation**\n\nWhen students imitate the style of Kandinsky, they are not simply reproducing his work; they are also learning to understand the underlying principles that govern his art.  By mastering brushwork and colour theory, they are building a foundation that will serve them well in their future creative endeavors.  However, the lesson plan takes an unexpected turn when the students are asked to cut up their paintings and build 3D sculptures out of the pieces.  This exercise not only challenges their technical skills, but also their ability to think creatively and exponentially build an existing idea.\n\n**The Emergence of Originality**\n\nAs students rebuild their paintings into 3D sculptures, their works begin to take on a life of their own.  Despite starting with the same source material, their creations are remarkably different, reflecting their unique perspectives and skill levels.  This is a testament to the power of imitation and innovation, which can lead to the emergence of something entirely new and original.  By building upon existing ideas and concepts, students are able to create something that is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\n**The Link between the Old and the New**\n\nThe art lesson in Denver highlights the intricate link between the past and the present, between imitation and innovation.  Creativity is not something that emerges out of thin air; it is a process that is deeply rooted in the knowledge and experience of those who have come before us.  By acknowledging this debt, we can continue to build upon the achievements of the past, creating something new and original that adds to the rich tapestry of human culture.  Ultimately, the art lesson in Denver is a reminder that creativity is a continuous process, one that requires us to engage with the past, build upon existing ideas, and push the boundaries of what is thought possible.",

A full house at the Allianz Stadium and the atmosphere crackling as Juventus fans put on their usual pre-game choreography: a sea of black and white placards broken only by a green, white and red tricolore to remind everyone this is where the reigning champions reside. Well, no, actually, that wouldn’t quite do it. Ultras also prepared their own banner, in which 1970s cartoon detective Nick Carter was seen, together with sidekicks Patsy and Ten, examining a map of Europe. Italy had been blocked out in black and white stripes. Above the picture was a message aimed at Inter’s owners: “The wise man says, ‘China is close, Italy is a mirage’.” Inevitable jibes aside, there was nervousness among the home fans as well. They might not like to admit it in Turin but, for the first time in a long time, Inter are a genuine threat. Only four games shy of the season’s midway stage, indeed, the Nerazzurri were top. They arrived unbeaten, and with fresh legs, too, on account of not playing in European competition. Mauro Icardi, a man who has enjoyed success against Juventus in the past, was top of the scoring charts.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

A full house at the Allianz Stadium and the atmosphere crackling as Juventus fans put on their usual pre-game choreography: a sea of black and white placards broken only by a green, white and red tricolore to remind everyone this is where the reigning champions reside. Well, no, actually, that wouldn’t quite do it. Ultras also prepared their own banner, in which 1970s cartoon detective Nick Carter was seen, together with sidekicks Patsy and Ten, examining a map of Europe. Italy had been blocked out in black and white stripes. Above the picture was a message aimed at Inter’s owners: “The wise man says, ‘China is close, Italy is a mirage’.” Inevitable jibes aside, there was nervousness among the home fans as well. They might not like to admit it in Turin but, for the first time in a long time, Inter are a genuine threat. Only four games shy of the season’s midway stage, indeed, the Nerazzurri were top. They arrived unbeaten, and with fresh legs, too, on account of not playing in European competition. Mauro Icardi, a man who has enjoyed success against Juventus in the past, was top of the scoring charts.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The atmosphere seemed to create a sound of anticipation that emptied the lake of optimism the home support once enjoyed albeit on a cold winter day with a moment like as of 'what if' next to frustration which now hits the scene right before their match.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In her essays, Susan Sontag spoke with one of the great, sure voices of the last century. From her salon at the centre of the cosmopolis, marvellously at one with her books and her learning, she considered, renamed and renewed our relationship with camp, with photography, with illness: a living legend of braininess and cool. Sontag, was not, though, as her editor Benjamin Taylor admits in the introduction to this gathering of stories from across her career, a committed short-story writer. She turned to the form in order to evade what Chekhov called “autobiographophobia”, which Taylor uses to mean the fear of writing and reflecting directly about one’s life. Evading this fear, Sontag clearly found the name “stories” very helpful: half of them are pure autobiography. “Pilgrimage”, for example, which opens the volume, is a memoir of Sontag’s youth in southern California, and an account of her visit with a boyfriend to the home of an ageing Thomas Mann. The only reason why this did not become an essay, it seems, is that the encounter was dull and disappointing, and so difficult to reflect on: Mann had “only sententious formulas to deliver. And I uttered nothing but tongue-tied simplicities, though I was full of complex feeling. We were neither of us at our best.” The next piece, “Project for a Trip to China”, is also memoir: we learn more about Sontag’s childhood (she was a voracious reader and dug deep holes in the garden to sit in); about her habit of ordering ambitiously in restaurants (hundred-year-old eggs); and a little about her father, who worked in China. The piece is more experimental, using lists and tables, characters identified by initials only, and lots of negatives (she does not, predictably, go to China).\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

With the return to surplus built on income tax revenue, any income tax cuts are unlikely to come before the next decade without either increases in other taxes or big cuts to government services. Amid the usual “free markets are great” rah-rah that the prime minister doled out to the Business Council of Australia on Monday night, Malcolm Turnbull also slipped in a line on income tax cuts, noting that he was: “Actively working with the treasurer and all my cabinet colleagues to ease the burden on middle-income Australians, while also meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” This was a bit of a surprise given the current state of the budget is such that the government is projecting that a return to surplus only in 2020-21and that net debt at that point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP. Even in the best of times, promising income tax cuts as the budget is in deficit is a courageous position to take for a political party that likes to prides itself on “budget responsibility”.It is even more courageous when the path back to surplus is built on a foundation of income tax revenue. Individual’s income tax has always been the biggest tax in the budget. During the mining-boom years it declined slightly in importance as company tax exploded in value from 3.3% of GDP in 1998-99 to5.3% of GDP in 2005-06. But in the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for just over half of all tax revenue. Now that in itself is a bit of a problem (the IMF and OECD have made calls for Australia to lessen its reliance on income tax) but it is a bigger problem for Turnbull and his call for tax cuts while also “meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” The issue it that of the extra $88.1bn in tax revenue the government hopes to gain between now and 2020-21, $48.5bn of it is to come from individual income tax. This means that income tax is actually bearing a greater burden of the increase in tax than would be expected.

    "response":"Technology has advanced significantly in recent years, but the basic principles of budget management remain unchanged. In Australia, the government continues to face the challenge of balancing the budget while investing in various public programs and infrastructure projects. The prime minister's recent speech to the Business Council of Australia has brought attention to the issue of income tax cuts, which the government may implement in the future.\n\nThe prime minister's proposal to ease the burden on middle-income Australians through income tax cuts may seem like a bold move, but it raises serious concerns about the government's ability to pay for these cuts. The current state of the budget projects a return to surplus only in 2020-21, and net debt is expected to reach $366 billion, or 17.6% of GDP. This is a significant concern for the government, as it may need to increase other taxes or cut government services to fund the proposed tax cuts. \n\nFrom a fiscal perspective, individual income tax has become a major contributor to the government's revenue. Although its importance was briefly eclipsed by company tax during the mining boom years, it has regained its position as the largest tax in the budget. In the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for more than half of all tax revenue, which is problematic according to international organizations such as the IMF and OECD. They have expressed concerns about Australia's reliance on individual income tax and have recommended reducing it.\n\nThe government's projected tax revenue growth between now and 2020-21 is dominated by individual income tax, which will bear a greater burden than expected. The $88.1 billion increase in tax revenue during this period is expected to come from individual income tax to a greater extent than any other source. This situation is not ideal, as individual income tax already accounts for a significant proportion of the budget. It is essential for the government to consider a more balanced tax structure to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability.\n\nIn light of these concerns, the government must carefully consider the implications of implementing income tax cuts. While the proposal may appeal to certain segments of society, it raises critical questions about the budget's sustainability. The government will need to demonstrate a clear plan for financing these cuts and may need to explore alternative options, such as increasing other taxes or cutting government services.

In Australia, the government continues to face the challenge of balancing the budget while investing in various public programs and infrastructure projects. The prime minister's recent speech to the Business Council of Australia has brought attention to the issue of income tax cuts, which the government may implement in the future.\n\nThe prime minister's proposal to ease the burden on middle-income Australians through income tax cuts may seem like a bold move, but it raises serious concerns about the government's ability to pay for these cuts. The current state of the budget projects a return to surplus only in 2020-21, and net debt is expected to reach $366 billion, or 17.6% of GDP. This is a significant concern for the government, as it may need to increase other taxes or cut government services to fund the proposed tax cuts. \n\nFrom a fiscal perspective, individual income tax has become a major contributor to the government's revenue. Although its importance was briefly eclipsed by company tax during the mining boom years, it has regained its position as the largest tax in the budget. In the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for more than half of all tax revenue, which is problematic according to international organizations such as the IMF and OECD. They have expressed concerns about Australia's reliance on individual income tax and have recommended reducing it.\n\nThe government's projected tax revenue growth between now and 2020-21 is dominated by individual income tax, which will bear a greater burden than expected. The $88.1 billion increase in tax revenue during this period is expected to come from individual income tax to a greater extent than any other source. This situation is not ideal, as individual income tax already accounts for a significant proportion of the budget. It is essential for the government to consider a more balanced tax structure to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability.\n\nIn light of these concerns, the government must carefully consider the implications of implementing income tax cuts. While the proposal may appeal to certain segments of society, it raises critical questions about the budget's sustainability. The government will need to demonstrate a clear plan for financing these cuts and may need to explore alternative options, such as increasing other taxes or cutting government services. By doing so, it can maintain its commitment to budget responsibility and ensure the long-term viability of the Australian economy.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Olivia Mead, a millionaire heiress whose list of expenses included a $1.2m crystal-encrusted grand piano and $2,000 annual upkeep of her pet axolotl, has had her inheritance cut from $25m to $6.14m following an appeal from her deceased father’s estate. The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father’s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have “any involvement or association whatsoever” with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than “traditional” Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead’s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court’s master, Craig Sanderson, said would “not fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community”. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright’s estate, acting on behalf of Wright’s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later. On Wednesday, the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court set aside Sanderson’s orders, ruling that while Sanderson was correct to say that Mead had been inadequately provided for in the original will: “The exercise of his discretion to order that provision be made for the respondent in the sum of $25m was flawed.” In a lengthy written judgment, the court found that Sanderson made a number of “material errors” in calculating the size of Mead’s inheritance, saying the focus should have been on what constituted “proper maintenance” and that the initial finding that Mead was “honest” and “not a gold-digger” were not relevant. “The capital sum should be sufficient to enable the respondent to purchase a reasonably substantial house with part of the capital sum and to invest the balance so that she will receive a reasonably substantial annuity for the remainder of her life,” the appeal court’s president, Michael Buss, said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Forget Bennelong or New England, the battle for Australia’s favourite bird is on. As the inaugural bird of the year poll launched on Monday, the nation’s celebrities, political leaders and media outlets immediately began their campaigns. The divisive Australian white ibis leapt to a commanding lead and the powerful owl, with the aid of Russian hackers, rose up the ranks. But in a crowded field of diverse native birds, endorsements rang out for nearly all contenders. The federal opposition leader, Bill Shorten, cut his ties to the magpie, currently coming second, and set his sights on the emu (whose image sits above Parliament House), in what must surely be an early election pitch. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, chose the Gang-gang cockatoo, another Canberra icon (“Incredible plumage but it sounds like a rusty door”), while fellow senator Nick McKim picked the wedge-tailed eagle, and Janet Rice, the hooded plover. Scott Ludlam, 2017’s first dual citizen, again displayed divided loyalties. The former senator endorsed the Carnaby’s black cockatoo at 3.45pm on Monday, but by 8.30pm, he suddenly declared himself “Team Bin Chicken”.

As the inaugural bird of the year poll launched on Monday, the nation’s celebrities, political leaders and media outlets immediately began their campaigns. The divisive Australian white ibis leapt to a commanding lead and the powerful owl, with the aid of Russian hackers, rose up the ranks. But in a crowded field of diverse native birds, endorsements rang out for nearly all contenders. The federal opposition leader, Bill Shorten, cut his ties to the magpie, currently coming second, and set his sights on the emu (whose image sits above Parliament House), in what must surely be an early election pitch. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, chose the Gang-gang cockatoo, another Canberra icon (“Incredible plumage but it sounds like a rusty door”), while fellow senator Nick McKim picked the wedge-tailed eagle, and Janet Rice, the hooded plover. Scott Ludlam, 2017’s first dual citizen, again displayed divided loyalties. The former senator endorsed the Carnaby’s black cockatoo at 3.45pm on Monday, but by 8.30pm, he suddenly declared himself “Team Bin Chicken”. Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, was asked but did not respond, opening himself up to a string of less-than-flattering replies.
