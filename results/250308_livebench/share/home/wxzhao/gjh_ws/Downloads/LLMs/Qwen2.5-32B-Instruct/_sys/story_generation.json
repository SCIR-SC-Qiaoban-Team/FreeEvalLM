      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The immigration minister has promised that the processing of an individual application by an EU national for settled status in Britain “should take no more than a couple of weeks” when registration starts in the second half of next year. The minister, Brandon Lewis, told the Commons home affairs select committee that an extra 1,200 UK visas and immigration staff were being recruited to process an expected 3.5m applications from EU nationals over two and a half years. He also told MPs on Tuesday that he was optimistic that an agreement could be struck by Christmas on the rights of EU citizens in the UK in the Brexit negotiations. However, he declined to comment on reports that the Brexit inner cabinet had decided on Monday that the European court of justice could continue to play a role in guaranteeing their rights during a two-year transition period. The Home Office minister did confirm that those refused “settled status” and classed as non-EU nationals in Britain illegally could have their bank accounts frozen and face deportation before the hearing of any appeal in British courts. The 3million group, representing EU nationals in Britain, immediately questioned Lewis’s claim that an agreement with the EU on “settled status” was likely before Christmas. “We wonder how. Major stumbling blocks still in place,” they tweeted, noting continued differences over the role of the ECJ, over family reunification rights that could affect thousands, and regarding clarification that they should not face “hostile environment measures”. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, voiced scepticism that an extra 1,200 staff – of whom 700 had already been recruited – would be sufficient when the UK Visas and Immigration agency (UKVI) currently used 6,500 staff to process 3m visa applications a year. There was already a three-month delay in processing EU nationals’ applications for permanent residence documents, she said.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Not in the strictly financial sense, though how much more threadbare core public services can become without collapsing and causing social mayhem the next few years will prove, if the government lasts. Even with faltering economic growth, public spending is to go on falling as a proportion of GDP. It’s bankrupt in ideas, in understanding, in preparedness to examine what has been happening to public services. Housing offers a glaring example. For all the bells and whistles in the budget, and some welcome augmentation of council powers, the government fails to make an obvious connexion. Building houses, allocating land, encouraging development, and policing the delinquency of private developers all imply an active and financially lubricated local government. Housing is and always will be about places, streets, brownfields – and public acceptance of schemes that will abut on their property or where they walk their dog. That’s what councillors do. Ace ideologue of the free market Oliver Letwin, of all people, can’t substitute.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n This is a bankrupt budget. Not in the strictly financial sense, though how much more threadbare core public services can become without collapsing and causing social mayhem the next few years will prove, if the government lasts. Even with faltering economic growth, public spending is to go on falling as a proportion of GDP. It’s bankrupt in ideas, in understanding, in preparedness to examine what has been happening to public services. Housing offers a glaring example. For all the bells and whistles in the budget, and some welcome augmentation of council powers, the government fails to make an obvious connexion. Building houses, allocating land, encouraging development, and policing the delinquency of private developers all imply an active and financially lubricated local government. Housing is and always will be about places, streets, brownfields – and public acceptance of schemes that will abut on their property or where they walk their dog. That’s what councillors do. Ace ideologue of the free market Oliver Letwin, of all people, can’t substitute.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

It is described as 'bankrupt', not solely in terms of finance, but also in terms of ideas, understanding, and preparedness to address the issues faced by public services.\nSECTION 2\n* The article draws attention to how the budget's failure to address the housing crisis demonstrates a lack of connection between the government's actions and the national needs. The construction of houses, planning permission, development, and managing private developers require an active and well-funded local government, an aspect the government has seemingly overlooked.\nSECTION 3\n* The article points out the need for public acceptance of housing schemes and how it's the role of councillors to ensure this acceptance. In this context, it criticizes the government's reliance on Oliver Letwin, an advocate of free markets, to oversee local development, suggesting that his stance on market freedom might not dovetail with the needs and demands of local citizens.\nAny other questions?\"",

The task is to create a story involving these sentences. I will incorporate the mandatory keywords while maintaining the enthusiasm in the narrative and upholding a smooth transition through the historical essence of Kelso.\n\\n\\nKeywords 'potential', 'run', and 'scheme' suggest the plot featuring a potential project perhaps a restoration scheme. 'Ship' could be a part of the historical background or storyline.\n\\n\\nThose sentences paint a picture of charm and guidance through time. A narrative has to convey this while linking the keywords seamlessly.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nIt has never been a mundane affair for me to visit Kelso. My enthusiasm for Romanesque architecture compels me to convince my colleague to embark on this quirky little run, an ivory tower that solidifies our past and guides our current series of explorations.\n\nWe probably haveKelso's potential regal status more to thank Abbots, of whom the town history proudly boasts. However, the depressing presence of half-ruined towers, crumbled jams around Kelso is another reality. Now, this is where the fire of admiration and leisurely exploration transforms into an insight into the potential of architectural conservation. \n\nOur scheme to restore Kelso's abbey would reacquaint not just us, but the entire region with its rich history. Through temples, tombs, and torn-down walls of this regal scripture, a tale of the utmost resilience and deep-rooted significance narrates itself.\n\nInterestingly, a set of tear-jerking letters penned by a local historian, referencing a ship nearing the shore loaded with plundered abbey artifacts, had come to my possession. The historian had gone on to state it was the only time the town of Kelso declined to receive. \n\nThe ship's physical remains dribble down the rivers Tweed and Teviot like a recall.

    "filtered_answer":"<|begin_of_thought|>\nThe key aspect of the given sentences deals with an individual showing enthusiasm for a particular type of architecture and sharing their journey to Kelso. The task is to create a story involving these sentences. I will incorporate the mandatory keywords while maintaining the enthusiasm in the narrative and upholding a smooth transition through the historical essence of Kelso.\n\\n\\nKeywords 'potential', 'run', and 'scheme' suggest the plot featuring a potential project perhaps a restoration scheme. 'Ship' could be a part of the historical background or storyline.\n\\n\\nThose sentences paint a picture of charm and guidance through time. A narrative has to convey this while linking the keywords seamlessly.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nIt has never been a mundane affair for me to visit Kelso. My enthusiasm for Romanesque architecture compels me to convince my colleague to embark on this quirky little run, an ivory tower that solidifies our past and guides our current series of explorations.\n\nWe probably haveKelso's potential regal status more to thank Abbots, of whom the town history proudly boasts. However, the depressing presence of half-ruined towers, crumbled jams around Kelso is another reality. Now, this is where the fire of admiration and leisurely exploration transforms into an insight into the potential of architectural conservation. \n\nOur scheme to restore Kelso's abbey would reacquaint not just us, but the entire region with its rich history. Through temples, tombs, and torn-down walls of this regal scripture, a tale of the utmost resilience and deep-rooted significance narrates itself.\n\nInterestingly, a set of tear-jerking letters penned by a local historian, referencing a ship nearing the shore loaded with plundered abbey artifacts, had come to my possession. The historian had gone on to state it was the only time the town of Kelso declined to receive. \n\nThe ship's physical remains dribble down the rivers Tweed and Teviot like a recall. As the river squishes its way, a 'how d'you do' from the undercurrents helping us topple our cognitive conundrum of 'to restore or not to restore'. After all, soaking in the immersion of architectural delight is what the town of Kelso, in all its squished glory, eloquently embodies.\n\nAny other questions?",

Dixon's current reality could not be more different though.\n\nSpotting this gangling bearded fellow in her peripheral vision one stormy evening, she glided over to secure the coat with a smile, his gaze burning into her. Any other man would have seen this as consent, but Dixon, in his world-weary wisdom, decided it better to be safe than sorry, asking her for a discrete tour of the book's contents. All was fine until they arrived at his apartment, when Mildred was greeted by the sight of Dixon's gregarious new neighbor, who had been eyeing up Dix from her balcony across the way.\n\nSharing a smirk, her eyes wild with double entendre, Dix suddenly found a double-edged sword in this beautiful, mysterious woman. Newly introduced to his world-weary, weary-world view, she had stolen the thunder from his usual prey, yet still held an undeniable allure. Dixon could perhaps have made his intentions clear, but this incurred the jealousy and forceful nature that Laurel was now projecting, leaving the trio teetering on the edge of a dark and dangerous confrontation. <|end_of_solution|>",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Philip Hammond must borrow an extra £90bn over the next five years after the Treasury’s independent forecaster downgraded productivity growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that the chancellor faced a long period of lower than expected wages growth that would dent tax receipts and push up borrowing. The cumulative effect over the life of the parliament would add £90.5bn to the UK’s debt pile and jeopardise Hammond’s target of balancing the government’s books by 2025, it said. The Treasury said that once the positive effects of an increase in employment and better than expected borrowing over the last year are taken into account, the net borrowing rise would be £35bn, putting the chancellor in a position to reach his target of creating a surplus in the middle of the next decade. But some analysts said the OBR’s revision failed to go far enough and it continued to overestimate the capacity of British businesses to invest in new equipment and processes to drive up productivity. They argued that the forecaster should have gone further and predicted that productivity growth – which measures the average output per hour worked – of almost zero over the last seven years would continue for another five years. Joanna Davies, a UK economist at Fathom Consulting, said the OBR’s new forecast that productivity would increase at a rate of 1.1% until 2022 – almost half the 2.1% average seen in the 30 years before 2007 – still looked ambitious. She said the prospects for GDP growth would suffer a severe knock-on effect from lower productivity and a rapidly ageing population. “Over the last five years, productivity growth has averaged just 0.3%,” she said. “Combined with UN projections for working-age population growth, the UK’s trend rate of overall economic growth is probably somewhere in the range 0.5%-1% – around half the 1.5% assumed by the OBR.” The OBR chair, Robert Chote, said GDP growth would not only be hit by lower productivity, but also a weaker than expected export sector that would fail to benefit significantly from the lower pound.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n MPs have been forced to deny that a Commons vote last week means animals are not recognised in the UK as sentient life forms. An amendment to the European Union (withdrawal bill to transfer the EU protocol on animal sentience into UK law was defeated by 313 votes to 295 on 15 November, and since then a row has developed as to what the vote meant in practice. Describing some of the reporting on the vote as “weird and dishonest”, Tory MP Zac Goldsmith tweeted a clarification that the vote had been about the correct legal procedure for ensuring animal welfare standards – not on the principle of whether animals are sentient. Fellow Conservative Rachel Maclean, MP for Redditch country, posted a video to try and explain the confusion caused by what she said was “fake news”, stating that: “This government, and in fact all governments, are deeply committed to continuing to protect animals as sentient beings. That law is already written into our own law.” Theresa May said at Wednesday’s PMQs: “We recognise and respect that animals are sentient beings, and should be treated accordingly.” Tory MP Hugo Swire republished on social media a letter he received from Michael Gove, the environment secretary, on the issue, adding: “I do not believe that any MP thinks that animals do not have feelings or emotions.” Nevertheless, the vote has triggered protests from animal rights groups, including multiple online petitions aimed at the House of Lords, UK parliament and Gove. Public figures including the presenter Sue Perkins have voiced strong criticism of MPs over the issue. Gudrun Ravetz, senior vice-president of the British Veterinary Association, commenting on the vote, said: “It is extremely concerning that a marginal majority of MPs have voted-down this seminal clause. This action undermines the government’s previous promises that the UK will continue to be known for our high standards of animal health and welfare post-Brexit.” However, Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley, pointed out that EU law still allowed many practices across Europe that animal rights groups oppose. The amendment, proposed by the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas, among others, had set out to specifically incorporate article 13 of title II of the Lisbon treaty into UK law. During debate on the amendment last Wednesday, Lucas pointed out that the origins of the clause began with the 1997 UK presidency of the EU and that from 1999 EU law had explicitly recognised that animals were sentient life forms.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Maclean posted a video to address the confusion caused by what she called 'fake news', stating that all governments are committed to protecting animals as sentient beings.\\n\\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May assured that the government 'recognizes and respects that animals are sentient beings and should be treated accordingly.'

The sentences mention important details such as the 1640 collection named \"moral and spiritual forest\" by Monteverdi and the conductor, Pablo Heras-Casado, and his recording.\n\nSummarizing Key Points:\n- 1640 collection called \"moral and spiritual forest\" by Monteverdi\n- Monteverdi's tenure as maestro di cappella at St. Mark's Basilica in Venice\n- Monteverdi's musical works ranging from grand ensembles to intimate solo performances\n- Recording featuring conductor Pablo Heras-Casado; critical note on over-shaping the music\n- Balthasar Neumann musicians, particularly sopranos Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner.\n\nBrainstorming the Story:\nReflecting on the given sentences, I plan to create a story that captures the essence of Monteverdi's music and the recording process with both critical and positive notes. I will highlight the musical journey, personalities involved, and musical nuances.\n\nDeveloping the Story Structure:\n- Paragraph 1: Introduction to Monteverdi, his musical career and the 1640 collection.\n- Paragraph 2: Description of Pablo Heras-Casado's recording, focusing on critical aspects.\n- Paragraph 3: Discussion on the Balthasar Neumann musicians' performance in the recording.\n- Paragraph 4: An insider look into the recording process.\n- Paragraph 5: Concluding thoughts on the recording and appreciation of Monteverdi's musical legacy.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nIn the year 1640, the Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi compiled a collection called \"Moral and Spiritual Forest,\" marking the pinnacle of his three-decade-long stint as the maestro di cappella at the prestigious St. Mark's Basilica in Venice. Monteverdi's compositions were characterized by their exploratory nature, embracing various forms of musical expressions, from grand ensembles to intimate solo performances. These musical gems were meant to be experienced within the sacrosanct walls of the basilica, which boasted a sumptuous acoustic and a world-class instrumental band paired with a 40-piece choir.\n\nFast forward to modern times, the venerable 1640 collection found its way into Pablo Heras-Casado's hands as he prepared to bring Monteverdi's musical legacy to contemporary audiences. While his dedication and effort should be applauded, his recording approach, at times, portrayed Monteverdi's work in a slightly bland presentation. Critics noted that the conductor's tendency to over-shape the music, particularly the grand ensembles, diminished the raw, spontaneous energy that Monteverdi's work strived to achieve.\n\nAmongst this less-than-ideal performance, the Balthasar Neumann musicians stood out. Their refined performances in the more intimate settings shone through Pablo Heras-Casado's recording, providing a radiant depiction of Monteverdi's artistry. Among these notable soloists were sopranos Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner. In their rendition of Salve Regina, the pair exhibited an electrifying singing technique that pierced through the soul, transforming the listener into a devotee of Monteverdi's masterful compositions.\n\nDelving into the intricate process of recording such a significant musical work, one is captivated by the efforts of the Balthasar Neumann musicians, led by conductor Pablo Heras-Casado, who aimed to honor Monteverdi's legacy with utmost dedication. Behind the scenes, the musicians and the conductor struggled to strike the perfect balance between modern interpretation and preserving the authenticity of Monteverdi's work. The high-stakes environment translated to sleepless nights filled with hard work and a relentless pursuit of perfection in every single note played and sung.\n\nAs the dust settles on the recording, it remains a testament to Monteverdi's contribution to Western classical music. Despite the critical notes and the occasional misstep in translation, it is impossible not to appreciate the seamless transition of musical greatness that \"Moral and Spiritual Forest\" represents. Much like Monteverdi's journey as a maestro, the recording process also illustrated the challenges and rewards of emulating musical greatness in modern times. The collective effort of the Balthasar Neumann musicians, the nuanced performance of the sopranos, and Pablo Heras-Casado's passion, have indeed immortalized Monteverdi's work for the generations to come.",

    "response":"\"Recently, the Guardian's archives offered an interesting glimpse into a distant echo of the modern football experience, a tale that takes us back to January 1907. The Liverpool side, emboldened by a fiery attack supplied by the dazzling trio of Jack Parkinson, Sam Raybould, and Jack Cox, seemed to be motoring towards victory at Roker Park, setting the soccer world alight with a commanding 4-1 lead by halftime. The Liverpool Echo, intoxicated by the prowess of the Liverpool players, compared their agile offense to a ship in full sail. However, it didn't come without price.\n\nSuch is the paradox of football, though. With success came overconfidence. The Liverpool players, perhaps enthralled by their resilience and victories, forgot the essential mantra that “a battle is never lost until it is won”. Thus, the second half was a turning point of the game. The Guardian noted an ominous shift in Liverpool's attitude. Instead of continuing their attacking plays, they fell into the traps of the game, and started to play as though they had already won. They conceded rash fouls and penalty kicks, laying the prince out on the chopping block for their fervent opponents to drag back into the fray.\n\nIt did not take long, as Sunderland, inspired by frustration and spurred by battler's fury, began to turn the tide. It was as if Liverpool's jubilant prophecy had lured them to summon what has not yet been seen. Over the next 45 minutes, the Ice Melter roared into action. The details were heart-wrenching to today’s Liverpool fan: a comeback mission made even more remarkable considering the ice-cold conditions of the ground. The match turned into a championship of sheer will power. By full time, an incredible 5-5 draw was noted—the first time Liverpool had ever given up a three-goal lead.\n\nThis event is a cautionary tale, a spark within football's expansive history, reminding us that even a roaring lion can be tamed by his own overconfidence. Could this performance have incited a dark paternal shadow over Liverpool's own football psyche, one that manifested in their future comeback invitation to rivals? It is an intriguing possibility, and a testament to the primal nature of the beautiful game.\"",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Airbnb has acquired accessible-travel startup Accomable as part of plans to improve its offering for disabled travellers. Accomable was launched just over two years ago by childhood friends Srin Madipalli and Martyn Sibley – who both have spinal muscular atrophy – to make it easier for people to find accessible places to stay around the world. It lists properties that can cater for a range of disabilities, highlighting details such as step-free access, hoists, roll-in showers and shower chairs. The site, now run by a team of six, with more than500 listings in 60 countries, grew rapidly thanks to a grant from the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, part of Oxford University’s Saïd Business School, and a further £300,000 funding from “angel” investors. Now, Accomable’s team and listings will be merged with Airbnb’s. In the coming months, the listings will be made available via the Airbnb site, and the team says it will now work towards improving the overall Airbnb experience for disabled travellers. Airbnb is also developing an “accessibility needs” checklist that allows hosts to be more descriptive about their home. In an open letter posted on its site, Madipalli reassured customers that the merger with a larger platform won’t mean accessibility becomes an “afterthought”. “Our decision to join Airbnb was one that we spent a long time considering,” he says. “Our work has allowed us to develop unrivalled expertise in the world of accessible travel, building a brand that disabled travellers can trust.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Accomable was launched just over two years ago by childhood friends Srin Madipalli and Martyn Sibley – who both have spinal muscular atrophy – to make it easier for people to find accessible places to stay around the world. It lists properties that can cater for a range of disabilities, highlighting details such as step-free access, hoists, roll-in showers and shower chairs. The site, now run by a team of six, with more than500 listings in 60 countries, grew rapidly thanks to a grant from the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, part of Oxford University’s Saïd Business School, and a further £300,000 funding from “angel” investors. Now, Accomable’s team and listings will be merged with Airbnb’s. In the coming months, the listings will be made available via the Airbnb site, and the team says it will now work towards improving the overall Airbnb experience for disabled travellers. Airbnb is also developing an “accessibility needs” checklist that allows hosts to be more descriptive about their home. In an open letter posted on its site, Madipalli reassured customers that the merger with a larger platform won’t mean accessibility becomes an “afterthought”. “Our decision to join Airbnb was one that we spent a long time considering,” he says. “Our work has allowed us to develop unrivalled expertise in the world of accessible travel, building a brand that disabled travellers can trust.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Dugdale rejected complaints from her Labour colleagues at Holyrood that taking part in the ITV reality show was akin to taking a second job, but admitted she would be well paid for it. Speaking to show-business reporters in Australia for the first time since her participation provoked a backlash from other Labour MSPs, Dugdale insisted the show would allow her to connect with voters. She said she had set aside three weeks’ salary as an MSP for the Rock Trust homeless charity and not a motor neurone disease campaign as previously thought. Dugdale launched a @TeamKez Twitter feed on Wednesday morning, featuring a short video clip recorded before she left Edinburgh of her wearing a Rock Trust T-shirt, where she addressed her constituents, and by extension her Labour critics. She said in the film: “I appreciate that to quite a few of my constituents, this is quite a controversial move. I know there will be people upset about it, that will question my priorities.” Saying they deserved an explanation, she added: “First and foremost, I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here is a huge UK-wide television programme, with an audience into the millions. “I think it’s an amazing opportunity to talk to young people who watch this programme about politics, and – in particular – Labour values.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Google has confirmed it has been able to track the location of Android users via the addresses of local mobile phone masts, even when location services were turned off and the sim cards removed to protect privacy. Revealed by a report by Quartz, Google’s Android system, which handles messaging services to ensure delivery of push notifications, began requesting the unique addresses of mobile phone masts (called Cell ID) at the beginning of 2017. The information was captured by the phone and routinely sent to Google by any modern Android device, even when location services were turned off and the sim card was removed. As a result Google could in theory track the location of the Android device and therefore the user, despite a reasonable expectation of privacy. A Google spokesperson said: “In January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery. “However, we never incorporated Cell ID into our network sync system, so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated it to no longer request Cell ID.” Google requested the Cell ID alongside what is called the mobile country code and mobile network code, which identify the country and mobile phone operator that the smartphone is using. That data is used to ensure the phone stays properly connected to Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging system, which handles the delivery of messages and notifications to the smartphone. A persistent connection is required for the system to work, but instead of staying constantly connected, the phone pings Google’s servers at set intervals. The more pings, the greater the battery drain, so the data collected about the country and mobile networks is used to work out the the minimum number of pings required to stay connected without draining the battery – so called heartbeat analysis. The benefit of having the address of the mobile phone mast to ensure message service reliability is not clear, but through a process of triangulation – the same used to assist when a user is actively using location services – the position of the user can be revealed down to a roughly 400m radius at a minimum, and often much more accurately in urban areas.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The information was captured by the phone and routinely sent to Google by any modern Android device, even when location services were turned off and the sim card was removed. As a result Google could in theory track the location of the Android device and therefore the user, despite a reasonable expectation of privacy. A Google spokesperson said: “In January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery. “However, we never incorporated Cell ID into our network sync system, so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated it to no longer request Cell ID.” Google requested the Cell ID alongside what is called the mobile country code and mobile network code, which identify the country and mobile phone operator that the smartphone is using. That data is used to ensure the phone stays properly connected to Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging system, which handles the delivery of messages and notifications to the smartphone. A persistent connection is required for the system to work, but instead of staying constantly connected, the phone pings Google’s servers at set intervals. The more pings, the greater the battery drain, so the data collected about the country and mobile networks is used to work out the the minimum number of pings required to stay connected without draining the battery – so called heartbeat analysis. The benefit of having the address of the mobile phone mast to ensure message service reliability is not clear, but through a process of triangulation – the same used to assist when a user is actively using location services – the position of the user can be revealed down to a roughly 400m radius at a minimum, and often much more accurately in urban areas.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Little, best known for his role as Anthony in the sitcom The Royle Family, accused the health secretary in a tweet of “knowingly lying” to the public about statistics and told Hunt to sue him if he was wrong. Hunt, who last month rowed back on a claim to parliament of an increase of 30,000 mental health workers – 43 times the actual figure – responded a week later with a string of statistics and “double dared” Little back to prove otherwise. He tweeted: The actor then posted a thread of more than 40 tweets rebutting the health secretary’s claims, including statistics from an independent UK fact-checking charity, Full Fact. That thread has been shared more than 15,000 times. The argument has since rolled on. Hunt on Monday replied with a series of 26 tweets of his own (although losing the chronology in the middle of the thread, making it difficult to follow). “Now I know you are a funny bloke and in politics a lot of insults are traded but the question is can you back up what is a very strong claim?” he asked Little, referring back to his “lying to the public” comment. “To fill the gap [in mental health staffing levels] we now have 8,000 MH nurses in training and have this Sept announced an increase in nurse training places overall by 25%.” Hunt also quoted from a New York Times article from July, which has been corrected three times after the former shadow minister for mental health, Luciana Berger, challenged its contents.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"Section 1\nIn a small British town, Jeremy Hunt, the local health secretary, has become embroiled in a Twitter row over the state of NHS mental healthcare with the beloved actor Ralf Little, who played Anthony in the popular sitcom The Royle Family. This feud began two weeks ago when Hunt appeared on The Andrew Marr Show, claiming that the NHS had overseen \"the biggest expansion of mental health provision in Europe.\" Little, who had been following the NHS's progress closely, accused Hunt of \"knowingly lying\" to the public about the statistics and dared him to sue if he was wrong.\n\nSection 2\nThe situation escalated when Hunt, who previously had to retract an incorrect claim about the increase in mental health workers, responded a week later with statistics and a \"double dare\" to Little to prove otherwise. Little, someone who takes his responsibility as a public figure seriously, decided to reply with a thread of over 40 tweets that challenged the health secretary's claims using data from an independent UK fact-checking charity called Full Fact. Little's thread gained massive traction, with over 15,000 shares from people who wanted the truth to come to light.\n\nSection 3\nThe confrontation between Hunt and Little escalated further as Hunt responded with a 26-tweet reply of his own. However, he lost the chronology in between, which made it difficult to follow. In the midst of this war of words, Hunt tried to put things into perspective by reminding Little that many insults are traded in politics and that the issue at hand is whether he backs up his strong claim. Hunt also mentioned that 8,000 mental health nurses are currently in training and that the number of nurse training places overall has been increased by 25%.\n\nSection 4\nHunt also decided to quote from a New York Times article from July that supported his claims; however, this article had been corrected three times after Luciana Berger, the former shadow minister for mental health, challenged its contents. Hunt's references did not convince Little or his supporters, who believed that Hunt had over-represented the NHS's success in mental health provision through false statistics.\n\nSection 5\nAs the debate on mental healthcare provision within the NHS unravelled on Twitter, the issue gained momentum, inciting a vibrant conversation among the public. Both parties presented their arguments, with Little's approach leaning heavily on fact-checking for accuracy while Hunt held onto his initial claims with a show of statistics. As the debate goes on, one thing remains clear: the importance of transparency in mental healthcare, and the desire for relevant and honest statistics regarding NHS mental healthcare remains a significant concern for the British public.",

It stars Emma Stone and Steve Carell, respectively women’s No 1 Billie Jean King and fiftysomething ex-champ and self-proclaimed “male chauvinist pig” Bobby Riggs – fighting to prove that men are better at tennis and better, full stop. The film crucially faces the same challenge as the participants from real life: the challenge of tone. How unseriously should this match be taken? How strenuously should the attitude of casual jokiness be maintained? No one involved in this encounter could be certain of its outcome; neither side could be sure of avoiding humiliation, and thus everyone had a vested interest in keeping it light. Up to a point. But only one side was facing jokiness as a weapon, the same weapon of boorish condescension and toxic bantz that they faced outside the sporting arena every day of their lives. The movie displays the same gracious good humour as its heroine. In 1973, King was enraged by the fact that female players on the grand slam circuit were paid a tiny fraction of what the men got, despite pulling in the same number of paying customers.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

This suggests the government's acknowledgement of underlying economic challenges and their determination to manage and address them, despite the forecasted slowdown in growth and productivity.\n<|end_of_solution|>",

He plans to launch a homemade rocket in California as part of a bid to eventually prove that the Earth is flat. Hughes has spent $20,000 (£15,000) building the steam-powered rocket in his spare time, and will be livestreaming the launch over the internet. The self-described daredevil says he switched his focus to rockets after twice breaking his back doing stunt jumps in cars. “I don’t believe in science,” declared the 61-year-old. “I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air. But that’s not science, that’s just a formula.” The rocket, which Hughes aims to reach an altitude of 1,800ft (550 metres) over California, will be launched from the back of a converted motorhome purchased from Craigslist. It is sponsored by a flat Earth research group, and Hughes plans a subsequent trip to try and observe the flatness of the Earth for himself. Speaking about the risks of the flight, Hughes said: “It’s scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive.” Hughes’ website describes him as “the only man to design, build and launch himself in a rocket” – he previously flew in his own rocket in 2014, as this footage shows. Hughes has stated that once he lands at the weekend, he intends to announce that he is running for the governorship of California.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Surging levels of violence at an “unsafe” G4S-run youth jail have put staff in hospital and caused inmates to carry improvised weapons for their safety, inspectors have revealed. The damning inspection report into Oakhill secure training centre, near Milton Keynes, was published on Tuesday as MPs heard that ministers had ordered G4S to set up an external inquiry into abuse allegations at Brook House, the immigration removal centre at Gatwick, which is also run by the private security firm. The joint report by the prison inspectors, with Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission, into Oakhill in September and October – when the centre was near capacity, with 75 boys aged 14 to 17 – finds “no evidence that staff can adequately care and control this volume of young people”. The report rates the youth prison as “inadequate” and says there has been an increase in fights and assaults since the last inspection in January; it records 330 assaults between March and August this year alone, with assaults against staff increasing, including against newly recruited staff, and some so serious they have led to people being taken to hospital. “One manager said that young people are carrying improvised weapons because they do not feel safe. This inhibits some staff from intervening because of the fear of a weapon, and this in turn reinforces the view of young people that staff cannot protect them, thereby continuing the cycle,” the report says. The inspectors say that many of the recommendations from their January inspection have not been met and the centre has deteriorated in most respects, including to do with safety, care, education, resettlement and the “effectiveness of leaders and managers”. They say that unacceptable behaviour, including swearing, intimidation and vandalism, is not being challenged by staff. Oakhill’s newly appointed interim director, Lisette Saunders, said: “We take these findings very seriously. In the report Ofsted recognised that senior managers at Oakhill know what is required to bring the centre up to acceptable standards.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"<|begin_of_thought|>\nThe task requires generating a story based on the given sentences. The sentences are from a news article about Oakhill secure training centre and Brook House immigration removal centre, both under the management of G4S. The sentences describe the poor safety conditions in Oakhill and the inadequacy of the institution. Additionally, there's mention of an ongoing investigation into abuse allegations at Brook House.\n\nFirst, I will summarize the main points of the provided sentences:\n- Oakhill secure training centre is \"unsafe\" and G4S-run, leading to fights and fatalities. \n- Inmates are reported to carry improvised weapons for their safety. \n- Staff has been injured, and some have been hospitalized. \n- Decreases in safety and care have been noted, as well as overseeing improper behaviors by staff. \n\nWith these points in mind, an engaging story could be centered on the deteriorating conditions in Oakhill, suggested by the inspection report. We could talk about the administrator's response and the ongoing efforts to improve the facility, or expound on the impact on the youth and staff.\n\nConsidering the detail included and the tone in which it's conveyed, a more formal story would be suitable. We can follow a journalistic structure, where we can introduce the issue with a strong headline or lead, expand on the safety issues described, then give room for a statement from the management, and add quotes or facts that further elaborate on the situation.\n\nLet me now write the story considering the key details and using a journalistic approach as a guide.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nUnsafe Conditions Plague G4S-run Oakhill Secure Training Centre\n\nAn alarming report issued by joint inspectors from the prison inspectors, Ofsted, and the Care Quality Commission, casts a critical light on the safety conditions at Oakhill secure training centre, a G4S-managed facility near Milton Keynes that houses young offenders aged 14 to 17. The inspectors highlight a significant spike in aggressive incidents and a noticeable decline in care standards, prompting serious concerns over the security of both the youth and staff members within the facility.\n\nThe inspectorate's investigation, conducted during September and October, reveals striking inadequacies in the center's ability to manage and care for its near capacity population of 75 boys. During the inspection period, there were 330 assaults alone, reflecting a substantial increase from the previous report in January. This upturn in aggression has not only endangered the youth but has also gravely impacted the staff, with some suffering serious injuries that required hospitalization.\n\nAdding to the grim conditions, some inmates have started crafting makeshift weapons to ward off potential threats, underlining a lack of safety and the failure of staff to intervene. The report details how this disturbing dynamic has solidified a vicious cycle: youth resorting to violence for their perceived security while disabling the intervention of staff, who fear for their own safety.\n\nThe extensive report states that senior management's efforts have not been successful in curbing the unacceptable behaviors among the youth, which include acts of verbal abuse, intimidation, and vandalism. The investigation also reveals a turning point as multiple recommendations from the January report have been ignored, leading not only to a decline in safety but also lingering issues in education, care, resettlement, and leadership.\n\nUpon release of the report, Lime St Saunderson, the newly-appointed interim director at Oakhill, expressed the administration's earnest concern and commitment to remedial changes. \"These findings weigh heavily on us, said Saunders. We are currently working resolutely to ensure these pressing issues are tackled and resolved,\" Saunders insists.\n\nHowever, Oakhill is not the only facility under scrutiny for G4S, as Brook House, an immigration removal centre in the vicinity of Gatwick airport, faces an external inquiry into reported incidents of abuse. Both entities underscore the need for serious introspection within G4S and the necessity for improvement in the management of secure and controlled environments.\n\nWhile specific measures and a timeline for reform haven't been detailed yet, the expectation is for these critical situations to be thoroughly addressed to prevent escalating conditions. Any other questions?",

The actor and Oscar-winning director, who has faced repeated damaging allegations of racist and misogynistic behaviour, said: “Things got shaken up a little bit and there is a lot of light being thrown into places where there were shadows and that is kind of healthy. It’s painful, but I think pain is a precursor to change.” Gibson was speaking while promoting his latest film, Daddy’s Home 2, his first family comedy in more than a decade after he was convicted of driving under the influence. He pleaded no contest to a misdemeanour battery charge in 2011 against his former girlfriend and mother of his child, Oksana Grigorieva. In 2010, it was reported that tapes had been submitted to the courts of Gibson allegedly using racist language and threatening to kill Grigorieva. He is also alleged to have said she deserved a beating. In one of the most notorious incidents involving the actor and director, Gibson unleashed an antisemitic rant in 2006 against a police officer in Malibu, California, who had pulled him over for drunk driving. He accused Jews of being responsible for “all the wars in the world”. He was convicted of driving under the influence. His latest comments come after dozens of women alleged they had been sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Stephen Martin, director general of the business group, is to issue the ultimatum to the government at the IoD annual dinner on Tuesday, saying “all we want for Christmas is progress on Brexit”. He will say the time would come soon when the IoD may have to advise all of its members to be ready for no deal and urged the government to stop this outcome. “We know from our recent surveys that over half of you are already in the process of contingency planning,” Martin will say. “The number of businesses who have actually implemented these plans is currently low, around one in 10, but this will snowball if we don’t find out soon what is going to happen in March 2019. “It’s clear that the government has a small window of opportunity between now and the end of the first quarter of next year to secure a firm political agreement on transition. If we don’t have this commitment by the end of March, then business will come under pressure to implement contingency plans, even perhaps as far as relocating operations.” He will say companies supported the idea of a transitional period after March 2019 to help the UK and rest of the EU adjust to Brexit, but they needed to know that cross-border trade would effectively remain unchanged. Martin will say that businesses do not want to move to World Trade Organisation rules as it would be a “huge drop down from where we are now” but may soon have to start planning for that possibility. “WTO is not the simple option, it would involve massive complexity to adjust our customs procedures, and we would lose not just our level of access to the single market, but also potentially all of the trade and investment agreements we have with other countries through the EU,” he will say. “It’s not desirable, but it is possible.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

In March he was cheered by his backbenchers after the UK avoided the recession predicted by many analysts following the Brexit vote last year. Employment was climbing and measures of consumer and business confidence, which plummeted after the referendum, had bounced back. But he was soon in deep trouble with his Tory colleagues for planning a one percentage point increase in national insurance on the self-employed and, in a humiliating U-turn, he was forced to ditch the whole idea.

Economy What we know: The UK economy expanded by 1.7% in 2016 but registered just 0.5% growth in the first half of this year. The pace has improved since the summer largely due to improving growth rates in Europe and the US, but the outlook remains weak.

The general election results and chilling economic outlook that shrank the nation's GDP had performed a significant drain on the community - especially young students embroiled in their fight for education, the key to unlocking their future. Inside the shop, Sarah, a painter and an education consumer, struggled with purchasing fresh canvases - she hoped to donate a painting to her community center to boost morale and represent their resilience - but the rising prices made her hesitate.\n\nDavid, her friend from school, was young and eager to get ahead: he knew education was his path but his mind couldn't resist thinking about the premise of a warmed hunk of meat over his plate and the healthy muscle he maintained through his budget-friendly eating. This entry-level calamity weighed heavily on his mind, for he began to envy his father, a beef wholesaler, who earned decent wages but faced pressure from increased import costs, impacted by the economic climate.\n\nNo matter the challenges, the spirit of the Smith & Sons community illuminated the early morning hours, one of unwavering optimism still dancing in each brushstroke of Sarah's painting. Their longing for change led a bloom of hope despite the bleak economic landscape.

I'll aim to find a narrative thread to connect all these elements in the story about the UK's economic state.\n\\n\\nI'll conceptualize the story as a broader social commentary with characters who must confront numerous challenges related to the political and economic landscape, each theme represented by one of the keywords.\n\\n\\n'Education' could symbolize the future of a country, while the 'bell' could represent the solemnity of times changing or an ominous tone about the near future.\n\\n\\n'Meat' and 'muscle' evoke imagery of sustenance and strength, vital themes during strained economic climates.\n\\n\\n'Painting' could symbolize culture and how art can reflect socioeconomic conditions. They will be intricately woven into the plot's backdrop, perhaps through a character's action or dialogue. <|end_of_thought|>\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nAmidst the solemn chimes of a bell in the aged Smith & Sons stationery shop, an anxiety-inducing foreboding filled the air. The general election results and chilling economic outlook that shrank the nation's GDP had performed a significant drain on the community - especially young students embroiled in their fight for education, the key to unlocking their future. Inside the shop, Sarah, a painter and an education consumer, struggled with purchasing fresh canvases - she hoped to donate a painting to her community center to boost morale and represent their resilience - but the rising prices made her hesitate.\n\nDavid, her friend from school, was young and eager to get ahead: he knew education was his path but his mind couldn't resist thinking about the premise of a warmed hunk of meat over his plate and the healthy muscle he maintained through his budget-friendly eating. This entry-level calamity weighed heavily on his mind, for he began to envy his father, a beef wholesaler, who earned decent wages but faced pressure from increased import costs, impacted by the economic climate.\n\nNo matter the challenges, the spirit of the Smith & Sons community illuminated the early morning hours, one of unwavering optimism still dancing in each brushstroke of Sarah's painting. Their longing for change led a bloom of hope despite the bleak economic landscape. Each successive day they looked toward the future with resilient hearts, embodying the spirit of the community as they strived for a better outcome. <|end_of_solution|>",

The Scottish Labour parliamentary group at Holyrood met to discuss her absence hours after Dugdale arrived in Australia to join 11 other contestants in the reality TV show. In a short statement, the group said it would not take any immediate action against her for flying out without getting formal approval to miss parliamentary sessions and votes. But the statement implied she could yet face some form of sanction. “In accordance with standard procedure, Kezia Dugdale will be interviewed on her return to parliament and have the opportunity to present her account of events,” the statement said. Dugdale’s partner, Jenny Gilruth, has defended her decision to appear on the show, saying she had delayed her arrival to try to avoid a clash with the election of her successor as party leader. Gilruth, a Scottish National party MSP, said those plans were sabotaged by a leak on Friday which meant news of Dugdale’s appearance on the show overshadowed Richard Leonard’s victory in the leadership vote. Gilruth told the Daily Record that Dugdale, a regional list MSP for the Lothians, had tried hard to avoid that happening and was upset by the impact the leak had had on the party, but also by the vitriolic attacks on her judgment. “The news that she was to be taking part was leaked many days before it was supposed to be known,” Gilruth said. “Indeed, she’s not even in there.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n An appeal against a ban on Silvio Berlusconi holding public office is to be heard by the European court of human rights, in a move that could potentially see Italy’s scandal-tainted former prime minister leading the country again. The hearing on Wednesday, six years after he was forced from office, follows his success at forging a winning coalition out of his centre-right Forza Italia and two far-right parties – the Northern League and Brothers of Italy – in regional elections in Sicily earlier this month. The outcome of the ballot on the southern Italian island was largely seen as a rehearsal for how things might play out in national elections, which must be held before May next year. It also marked the beginning of an authentic political comeback for the 81-year-old, despite being plagued by a tax fraud conviction, sex scandals and allegations of corruption. Considering the length of time it takes for the court to deliver a verdict, it is unlikely to come before the general elections. The current five-year term for the Italian government officially expires on 15 March, although the vote could be held as late as May. “I hope that the Strasbourg court will accept my appeal,” Berlusconi wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “But my role in the next electoral campaign is clear regardless: I will be in the field looking to take the centre-right into government.” The billionaire, who was forced to resign from his third term as prime minister in 2011 over claims he paid for sex with an underage sex worker, has hired top lawyers from London’s Doughty Street Chambers to fight his case. He was ejected from parliament and banned from running for office for six years in 2013 due to his tax fraud conviction. “We’ll have just 30 minutes to set out our argument, the same goes for the government,” Andrea Saccucci, one of the lawyers who will represent Berlusconi in the Strasbourg court, told the Guardian.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

His career is less about the quantity of releases and more about fulfilling every waking moment with a different kind of music and experimentation. \n\nSection 2\nIn a bustling city of San Francisco, John Dwyer, frontman of Thee Oh Sees, stood on a stage with a diverse crowd of music lovers glimpsing the city's iconic golden gate bridge. John, then in his mid-twenties, was touring recently released album \"Bangers vs Fuckers\" with his former band Coachwhips. Spontaneous thrills filled the venue. John's experimental flair, bringing in sounds of instruments as diverse as electronic bagpipes, telephony gizmos and even a flute added vibrant hues to the show. In an eclectic range of genres, Dwyer packaged his unique motto - the raw inclination to taste everything life brings. The cohesiveness of his approach influenced aspiring musicians who grew to appreciate his wealth of musical ventures, an ambition as impactful as San Francisco's vibrancy. Any other questions?\"",

In a precedent-setting ruling that will echo across the EU, the European court of justice ordered Poland to show it was acting lawfully in the ancient woodland, or face a €36.5m (£32m) annual penalty. Agata Szafraniuk, a lawyer for the green law firm ClientEarth, said that the court was acting after Poland’s environment minister, Jan Szyszko, showed “complete contempt” for an earlier emergency ban on logging in the ancient woodland. “Financial penalties are, unfortunately, an essential tool to ensure that the best-preserved primeval forest in Europe is protected from further harm,” she said. “Trees are still being cut down every day, so the court prescribed this measure to guarantee the full protection of this unique forest, and to avoid irreparable damage.” The court move will ratchet up pressure on Poland, which is already facing a suspension of its EU Council voting rights over a clampdown on the country’s independent press and judiciary. Women’s groups have also been targeted for police raids, and rights to protest have been curtailed, adding to concerns about the rule of law in the east European country. Donald Tusk, the EU Council president, condemned Poland’s nationalist-right Law and Justice party government on Sunday, suggesting it was following the “Kremlin’s plan”.

    "response":"Section 1\n<|begin_of_thought|>\nFirst, I will analyze the provided sentences to understand the context and main themes. From what I can deduce, the sentences describe a news article from The Guardian about a horse named Sizing John, and his trainer, Jessica Harrington. The trainer expresses a wish to have the horse compete in the Gold Cup, acknowledging the difficulty of achieving this goal as top-class staying chasers tend to struggle to return to a high level after winning such a significant race. The trainer also mentions her concerns about the horse having three hard races the previous year and its potential impact on Sizing John's future performance. Knowing that Sizing John is seven years old, the article also states that the horse looks in good condition.\n<|end_of_thought|>\nSection 2\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nIn a story, we can describe the trainer's strategy and efforts to ensure Sizing John is ready for the Gold Cup while also addressing her concerns. I will begin the story with the trainer discussing her ambitions for the horse and the challenges she may face.\n<|end_of_solution|>\nSection 3\n<|begin_of_thought|>\nWith the current thoughts and insights, I will now craft the story following the provided text. The story will revolve around Sizing John, trainer Jessica Harrington's ambitions, and the efforts to prepare the horse for the Gold Cup despite any past concerns.\n<|end_of_thought|>\nSection 4\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nIn a spacious stable at Jessica Harrington's yard, Sizing John, glinting under the sunlight, stood tall and proud. Trainer Jessica Harrington eyed the horse closely, her hands caressing the mane. Sizing John had brought her much pride and recognition after his victorious performance the year before. As she stroked the horse, Harrington pondered the upcoming season and set her baseline ambition for Sizing John—returning to the Gold Cup.\n\nUnderstanding the rough road ahead, Harrington acknowledged that staying power in the racing world is uncommon.

    "filtered_answer":"Section 1\n<|begin_of_thought|>\nFirst, I will analyze the provided sentences to understand the context and main themes. From what I can deduce, the sentences describe a news article from The Guardian about a horse named Sizing John, and his trainer, Jessica Harrington. The trainer expresses a wish to have the horse compete in the Gold Cup, acknowledging the difficulty of achieving this goal as top-class staying chasers tend to struggle to return to a high level after winning such a significant race. The trainer also mentions her concerns about the horse having three hard races the previous year and its potential impact on Sizing John's future performance. Knowing that Sizing John is seven years old, the article also states that the horse looks in good condition.\n<|end_of_thought|>\nSection 2\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nIn a story, we can describe the trainer's strategy and efforts to ensure Sizing John is ready for the Gold Cup while also addressing her concerns. I will begin the story with the trainer discussing her ambitions for the horse and the challenges she may face.\n<|end_of_solution|>\nSection 3\n<|begin_of_thought|>\nWith the current thoughts and insights, I will now craft the story following the provided text. The story will revolve around Sizing John, trainer Jessica Harrington's ambitions, and the efforts to prepare the horse for the Gold Cup despite any past concerns.\n<|end_of_thought|>\nSection 4\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nIn a spacious stable at Jessica Harrington's yard, Sizing John, glinting under the sunlight, stood tall and proud. Trainer Jessica Harrington eyed the horse closely, her hands caressing the mane. Sizing John had brought her much pride and recognition after his victorious performance the year before. As she stroked the horse, Harrington pondered the upcoming season and set her baseline ambition for Sizing John—returning to the Gold Cup.\n\nUnderstanding the rough road ahead, Harrington acknowledged that staying power in the racing world is uncommon. Neither Coneygree nor Don Cossack managed to make it back to the Gold Cup after winning it, and Sizing John faced similar challenges. The hard races the previous year might leave their mark on the horse's performances.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Concordia International, the Canadian drug company, has overcharged the NHS by more than £100m in the past decade for a life-changing thyroid drug, according to Britain’s competition watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had provisionally found that Concordia had “abused its dominant position to overcharge the NHS” by hiking the price of liothyronine, used to treat patients with an underactive thyroid, by nearly 6,000% between 2007 and 2017. The regulator said the NHS had spent more than £34m on the drug last year, up from about £600,000 in 2006. The amount it paid per pack rose from £4.46 in 2007 to £258.19 by July 2017. The price of a single pill went up from 16p to £9.22, even though production costs remained broadly stable during that period, the CMA said. Concordia could be fined up to 10% of its worldwide annual turnover. Liothyronine tablets are used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition caused by a deficiency of the thyroid hormone that affects at least two in 100 people and can lead to depression, tiredness and weight gain. For many patients there is no alternative and, until this year, Concordia was the only supplier. This summer, the UK firm Morningside Healthcare and Israel’s Teva were granted licences to supply the drug. The medicine, a synthetic version of the hormone T3, is taken by patients who do not respond well to the cheaper alternative, levothyroxine.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"\"Concordia International, a Canadian pharmaceutical company, has been under scrutiny for overcharging the UK's National Health Service (NHS) by more than £100m within the last decade. The overcharging is related to a life-altering thyroid drug, and the culprit has been identified by Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The CMA has provisionally concluded that Concordia misused its powerful market position to increase the drug's prices steeply. The drug in question, liothyronine, is vital for individuals suffering from an underactive thyroid, and since Concordia was the sole supplier, there were limited alternatives for patient care.\n\n\\n\\nStrategy adopted by Concordia International to overcharge the NHS was primarily based on sheer monopolistic control over liothyronine. Between 2007 and 2017, a 6,000% surge in the drug price was seen. Liothyronine's production cost remained steady over the years but its cost to patients rose exponentially from 16p to £9.22 per pill. This translated to an astronomical cost for the NHS as their spending on this drug climbed from roughly £600,000 in 2006 to more than £34m the previous year. This strategy allowed Concordia to ride on its monopoly and manipulate the market prices. However, the CMA has now provisionally found violations of fair trading practices and may result in sizable fines for Concordia.\n\n\\n\\nThe aftermath of this monopolistic price manipulation has had grave implications for the NHS and the patients. Overcharged by such a large amount, the NHS has had to grapple with the increased expenditure on a drug that has no immediate alternatives. Each pack's price jumped significantly from £4.46 to over £258, making it difficult for the healthcare system and individuals to uphold the mandatory treatment for underactive thyroid. In bleak situations, patients can face depression, fatigue, and severe weight gain without the proper management of their condition.\n\n\\n\\nTo tackle this humanitarian and financial challenge, recent developments have emerged. This summer saw the market open up for liothyronine with the UK-based Morningside Healthcare and Israel’s Teva Pharmaceuticals obtaining licenses to supply the drug. The sanctioning of these additional suppliers aims to diversify the market and apply necessary pressure to balance drug prices. Given the essential need for this specific medicine by many patients and its unbreachable cost implications, this change bodes well for future medical care and potential cost cuts for patients and providers.\"",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Turnbull government has deployed new modelling on the national energy guarantee in an effort to step up pressure on state governments to sign up to its policy at a meeting of energy ministers on Friday. A summary of the modelling, circulated by the government in advance of the talks with the states, suggests household power bills between 2020 and 2030 would be “in the order of” $120 a year lower, in today’s dollars, than under a business-as-usual scenario, if the policy applied across the national electricity market. The material supplied by the government says wholesale electricity prices would be 23% lower than business-as-usual between 2020 and 2030, and it suggests the share of renewables in the market by 2030 “could range from 32% to 36%”. The full modelling, undertaken for the Energy Security Board by Frontier Economics, has not yet been distributed to state energy ministers and the documents circulated in Canberra are a summary of the findings, not the work itself. The Turnbull government announced in October it would dump the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and proceed with the national energy guarantee – a policy that imposes new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020. The policy requires cooperation from the states but some of the Labor governments, particularly South Australia, have been hostile. Part of the reason for that is the states were involved in the exhaustive consultations with Finkel about the clean energy target but were not kept in the loop about the national energy guarantee. Some state governments are also concerned the Turnbull policy will hard-bake coal into the system at the expense of renewables at a time when the energy market needs to transition to low-emissions power sources. A spokesman for the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, is continuing to insist that the state will not commit to sign on to the national energy guarantee in the absence of data showing its specific impact on the state. The Labor states have also commissioned their own work through the Council of Australian Governments energy council examining whether or not they could implement a clean energy target by themselves.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Succinctly summarising the gruesome reality, he remarked, “it wasn't a matter of if a person would die in the back of a police van but when.”\n\nOn September 16th of last year, two patrol officers were on their way to an alleged noise complaint in Darwin when they encountered the scene of a violent crash. The crash occurred at the junction of the Stuart Highway and Bargot Road, on the way to Darwin airport, with a Toyota Hilux colliding against a large palm tree.\n\nThe Toyota's driver, a man named Dale Scott Walkinshaw, was shockingly in a state of drunkenness, as evidenced by the high 0.149 BAC reading. Walkinshaw was physically indistinct from the scenario, having concealed himself in vegetation, but held the car's passenger – a young woman he had just met at a local bar – in his arms. The woman was critically injured and in and out of consciousness, having sustained a severe spinal injury from the accident.\n\nDrawing from the provided sentences, this narrative outlines the inability of the Northern Territory police to respond to a critical public safety issue which had caused death and injury, and takes a sneak peek into the frenetic circumstances leading towards another incident.\"",

The airline reported a record year for passenger numbers, flying 80.2 million people, almost 10% more than in 2015-16, on ever fuller planes. But while revenues exceeded £5bn in 2016-17, fares dipped to fill seats in what the chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said was “a difficult year for the aviation industry”. McCall said: “Our planned approach of achieving number one or two positions at Europe’s leading airports, friendly and efficient customer service and a continuous focus on sustainable cost control, has put easyJet at a strategic advantage during a period when there have been bankruptcies and some airlines have struggled operationally.” Profits before tax fell from £494m to £408m.

About a third of shares are owned by the easyJet founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who has dual UK-Cypriot nationality, and will be classed as EU-owned. But easyJet will ask at its 2018 AGM for new powers to force UK shareholders to sell up if necessary to allow it to continue operating in Europe. McCall said the move was “a technical, administrative thing” and the airline had “no concerns” about getting enough EU shareholders.

    "response":"<<EasyJet's Troubled Year: A Modern Odyssey>>\n\nSection 1\nAmidst the turbulent political climate of the Brexit referendum, EasyJet, a flagship UK airline, found itself wrestling with a series of daunting challenges. As the pound depreciated significantly, EasyJet's profits dwindled by 17%, with over £100 million lost, leaving EasyJet's fiscal fortress all but breached. The airline had weathered indomitable winds, employing stringent cost management strategies to maintain its stronghold amidst the chaos. Still, the situation demanded a daring foray into uncharted waters.\n\nSection 2\nIn a society increasingly inured to the volatility of financial markets, EasyJet's resilience stood out like a towering lighthouse amidst the maritime storms. However, this buoyancy had a cost - fares dipped to fill an overcrowded plane, and the company's expanding passenger base could not completely offset the plummeting revenue.

    "filtered_answer":"<<EasyJet's Troubled Year: A Modern Odyssey>>\n\nSection 1\nAmidst the turbulent political climate of the Brexit referendum, EasyJet, a flagship UK airline, found itself wrestling with a series of daunting challenges. As the pound depreciated significantly, EasyJet's profits dwindled by 17%, with over £100 million lost, leaving EasyJet's fiscal fortress all but breached. The airline had weathered indomitable winds, employing stringent cost management strategies to maintain its stronghold amidst the chaos. Still, the situation demanded a daring foray into uncharted waters.\n\nSection 2\nIn a society increasingly inured to the volatility of financial markets, EasyJet's resilience stood out like a towering lighthouse amidst the maritime storms. However, this buoyancy had a cost - fares dipped to fill an overcrowded plane, and the company's expanding passenger base could not completely offset the plummeting revenue. Despite this challenge, the EasyJet captain, Carolyn McCall, called for solidarity among the crew. The innovative strategy of operating primarily from leading European airports and investing in customer satisfaction proved to be their best reprieve, barring them from complete catastrophe.\n\nSection 3\nIn a bid to fortify their standing in the EU, EasyJet proposed new provisions to ensure majority ownership by EU nationals after 2019 by daringly requesting authority to compel UK shareholders to divest if necessary.

He noticed a stick pinched between the fingers of a passing street performer's charcoal drawing stick, thick smoke from the stick settling into the air, creating a layer of haze around the singer who's live act was enchanting the crowd for the second consecutive performance.

John Lewis has become a prime target for Stop Funding Hate on the back of the launch of its Christmas advert and as retailers increase their spending on advertising as the festive season approaches. Stop Funding Hate has produced a mock advert that depicts the star of last year’s John Lewis Christmas advert – Buster the dog – as unhappy because the retailer is buying adverts with the Mail, Sun, and Express. The video has been shared almost 10,000 times on Twitter and Facebook. Sainsbury’s, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose are also being targeted by Stop Funding Hate.

It would be great if John Lewis made a move, but another company could make a move too.” However, John Lewis said it would continue advertising with the newspapers and not bow to the pressure. A spokesperson said: “Withdrawing advertising on the basis of editorial coverage would be inconsistent with our democratic principles, which include freedom of speech and remaining apolitical.” Paperchase announced on Monday that it would not run any marketing campaigns with the Daily Mail and said it was “truly sorry” for running a front-page promotion in Saturday’s edition of the newspaper.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.
