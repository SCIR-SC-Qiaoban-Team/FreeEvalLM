The pair fell in love and married (though in the end, Goodall’s happy-ever-after was with the chimps not Van Lawick).

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n What does it mean when dancers express emotion on stage? Do they bring real-life experiences to those highly choreographed moments when they’re leaping with ecstasy, racked by grief or, as in the climax of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring, dancing themselves to death on behalf of a fearful, threatened community? These are some of the questions posed by Goat, the raw, funny and occasionally searing new piece of dance theatre that Ben Duke has made for Rambert. The setting is an ambiguous space that is part meeting hall, part performance arena, and its “characters” are a group of dancers and musicians who have gathered to enact some kind of cathartic emotional ritual. Miguel Altunaga plays a reporter sent to describe it, and the tone at first is wickedly funny as Altunaga – a pitch perfect combination of intrusive and bewildered – tries to make sense of what’s happening. “Amazing energy,” he pronounces as the group rock through a happy-clappy ensemble. Then as the group divide into individual solos, contorting their bodies into expressions of private feeling, he trails after the dancers, hoping for elucidation. One of them, her limbs tied into an agonised knot, explains breathlessly that she’s dancing about the “stigma of addiction”. Another, his eyes rolling back in his head with exertion, says he’s expressing a sense of betrayal. It’s a brilliant riff on the worst cliches of interpretative modern dance but Duke is soon flipping the work into something deeper, darker and more personal.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "response":"Section 1\nThe text discusses a dance performance called Goat, which explores the connection between dancers' real-life experiences and their expressions on stage. The performance is staged in an undefined area that seems like a mix of social hall and performance space. The piece features dancers and musicians who undergo an emotional ritual guided by a reporter named Miguel Altunaga. This reporter aims to make sense of the ritual, interacting with the performers and their emotions. To connect the text to the required keywords, we could imagine that the reporter's task is like analyzing the complex signs seen in a file, garden, or tool, trying to decipher the coded message and the outcome of the performance.\n\nSection 2\nIn Goat, Miguel Altunaga, portrayed by Miguel Altunaga, is trying to comprehend the personal feelings represented through the dancers' movements. Initially, the work plays on clichés surrounding interpretive modern dance, such as dancing about the stigma of addiction or betrayal. As the performance progresses, Goat becomes more personal, delving into darker, deeper emotions. In terms of the given keywords, this process can be thought of as peeling back layers to uncover the true essence of the performance, akin to understanding the planting process in a garden, the function of a tool, or the message contained within a file.\n\nSection 3\nThe dance performance Goat skillfully humorously intertwines with more somber reflections on human experiences. The reporter Miguel Altunaga is tasked with inhabiting the role of an observer, trying to deconstruct the symbolism and grasp the emotional significance of the ritual. This narrative technique, using the reporter's perspective, acts like a tool for the audience to understand and empathize with the dancers as they explore their emotions and the impact of their real-life experiences on their performances. \n\nSection 4\nFor the audience, Goat serves as a medium to question the purpose and the emotions expressed in choreography. This dance creation compels audiences to reflect on the authenticity or cathartic performance outcomes, similar to using a garden to cultivate emotional well-being, or a file to store meaningful personal records. It allows us to think about the interplay between private feelings and public expressions, evoking questions about the purpose of art and its ability to convey personal messages.\n\nSection 5\nUltimately, Goat is a thought-provoking piece of dance theatre that confronts its audience with questions regarding the authenticity and intensity of dance performances and the emotions they convey. Like a file can hold confidential documents, a garden may conceal hidden meanings, or a tool can serve multiple purposes, Goat, through the lens of Miguel Altunaga, showcases the complexity of human experiences and its translation into captivating visual and emotional narratives. The outcome is a moving and revealing exploration into the depths of human expression through art.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Ministers have sought to see off a potential rebellion by Conservative MPs that could have brought a first defeat over the EU withdrawal bill by partially backing down on the future status of EU human rights measures in UK law. Following another day of debate about the bill, which seeks to transpose EU statute into UK law post-Brexit, the government faced possible defeat over amendments intended to maintain the scope of the EU charter on fundamental rights. Several of the amendments were tabled by Dominic Grieve, the Tory former attorney general and a leading Brexit rebel, with speculation that enough of his fellow Tories would back some of these to inflict defeat. However, the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, said the government was willing to work with Grieve to see how rights under the charter could be kept after Brexit, and would introduce its own amendment to this effect later in the bill’s passage. Grieve said this was sufficient reassurance for him and that he would not press for a vote on his amendments. Ken Clarke, another leading Conservative Brexit rebel, refused to guarantee he would not press for a vote on one amendment, which would allow Britons to mount legal challenges under the charter after Brexit, to which he was the second signatory after Grieve. However, with Grieve backing away, the chances of a government defeat were notably lessened if a vote was called. Buckland said he did not fully agree with Grieve’s amendment, which would allow challenges to EU law retained after Brexit “on the grounds that it is in breach of general principles of EU law”, and questioned whether it would add anything “that is relevant or material” to existing rights. But Buckland said: “Let me say that we do recognise the strength of views from my right honourable friend and, indeed, from other honourable members and honourable friends on this issue – many of whom have spoken this afternoon. “We’re listening, and we are prepared to look again at this issue to make sure that we are taking an approach that can command the support of this house.” Buckland said he would happily discuss a way forward with Grieve, “and agree to work together with us in this shared endeavour”, which would result in a government amendment in the report stage, the next part of the bill’s passage through the Commons.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "response":"<<Breaking Down the News>>\n\nSection 1\nThought\nThe text describes a situation where Conservative MPs were arranged to oppose the EU withdrawal bill, which aims to incorporate EU statutes into UK law after Brexit. The potential opposition was led by Dominic Grieve, who proposed amendments to retain the scope of the EU charter on fundamental rights. However, Robert Buckland, the solicitor general, sought to prevent this by expressing the government's willingness to work with Grieve to maintain aspects of the charter relevant to UK law following Brexit. This development prevented a possible defeat for the government on the amendments, as Grieve, a key figure in opposition, backed down. However, Ken Clarke, another Conservative MP, expressed his willingness to continue pushing an amendment that would allow Britons to challenge EU law.\n\\n\\nThe passage focuses on how the government attempted to quell the rebellion by partially conceding to the MPs' requests, specifically in regard to the future status of EU human rights measures in UK law. This negotiation between the government and the opposition signifies a compromised approach towards the handling of the EU withdrawal bill, which is crucial given Britain's exit from the EU.\n\\n\\nThe analysis reveals a complex political scenario where the government aims to balance its stance on the EU withdrawal bill with an eye towards domestic political harmony. It’s a delicate balance as the government must consider the views of MPs who are skeptical or against Brexit while also aiming to pass the necessary legislation to make Brexit effective.\n\\n\\nIn the future, the government plans to introduce its own amendment related to the EU charter rights. Buckland's approach is to reassess these matters and ensure that the proposed measures can gain support.\n\nSection 2\nSolution\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n* The government is trying to prevent a rebellion from Conservative MPs by agreeing to discuss retaining some EU human rights laws in UK law after Brexit, which could have led to a defeat on the EU withdrawal bill if they had not compromised.\n<|end_of_solution|>\n\nSection 3\nP.S.

The potential opposition was led by Dominic Grieve, who proposed amendments to retain the scope of the EU charter on fundamental rights. However, Robert Buckland, the solicitor general, sought to prevent this by expressing the government's willingness to work with Grieve to maintain aspects of the charter relevant to UK law following Brexit. This development prevented a possible defeat for the government on the amendments, as Grieve, a key figure in opposition, backed down. However, Ken Clarke, another Conservative MP, expressed his willingness to continue pushing an amendment that would allow Britons to challenge EU law.\n\\n\\nThe passage focuses on how the government attempted to quell the rebellion by partially conceding to the MPs' requests, specifically in regard to the future status of EU human rights measures in UK law. This negotiation between the government and the opposition signifies a compromised approach towards the handling of the EU withdrawal bill, which is crucial given Britain's exit from the EU.\n\\n\\nThe analysis reveals a complex political scenario where the government aims to balance its stance on the EU withdrawal bill with an eye towards domestic political harmony. It’s a delicate balance as the government must consider the views of MPs who are skeptical or against Brexit while also aiming to pass the necessary legislation to make Brexit effective.\n\\n\\nIn the future, the government plans to introduce its own amendment related to the EU charter rights. Buckland's approach is to reassess these matters and ensure that the proposed measures can gain support.\n\nSection 2\nSolution\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n* The government is trying to prevent a rebellion from Conservative MPs by agreeing to discuss retaining some EU human rights laws in UK law after Brexit, which could have led to a defeat on the EU withdrawal bill if they had not compromised.\n<|end_of_solution|>\n\nSection 3\nP.S. The discussion highlights the complexity of the Brexit process and the ongoing negotiations between the government and MPs regarding the future status of EU laws in UK law.\n\\n\\nIs there anything else I can help with?",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In 1612, a contemporary of Shakespeare’s, the playwright Thomas Heywood, published An Apology for Actors, in which he expressed a patriotic sentiment about the English language, boastful at the time, which now seems unexceptional: Our English tongue, which hath been the most harsh, uneven and broken language of the world... is now continually refined, every writer striving in himself to add a new flourish unto it; so that it is grown into a most perfect and composed language. The coming of age of English at the beginning of the 17th century, after a golden generation of extraordinary growth and innovation, is symbolised by the publication of a landmark edition that the playwright himself had never bothered with in his own lifetime. Indeed, it was not until seven years after his death, thanks to the First Folio, that his work began slowly to acquire the canonical status it enjoys today. Towards the end of November 1623, the bookseller Edward Blount, who traded at the sign of the Black Bear near St Paul’s, finally held in his hands the text of a great volume for which he had long been waiting: Mr William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories &amp; Tragedies.

The trove of work thus assembled gave posterity not just a cast of immortal characters (Bottom, Falstaff, Lear, Portia, Jaques, Prospero et al), but also a heap of new words (including, for example, catastrophe, exaggerate, assassinate, indifference, monopoly and paradox).

Other facts about the First Folio, a canon of incomparable power and authority, and the text that would help launch Shakespeare’s global literary afterlife are indisputable: both its value (somewhere north of $5m in rare books’ sales) and its comparative rarity (approximately 240 copies survive worldwide in public and private collections).\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Ratko Mladić, the Serb warlord who terrorised Bosnia in the 1990s, was on Wednesday forcibly removed from court after a shouting outburst delayed the reading of the verdict in his trial for the last genocide committed in Europe. The long-anticipated verdict was previously delayed for half an hour after Mladic asked the judge if he could take a short bathroom break. The delay was extended as rumours began to circulate that the former Bosnian Serb commander, who had appeared healthy when sitting in court, had suddenly been taken ill. As he entered the ICTY courtroom, Mladic had infuriated relatives of the victims as gave a broad smile and gave a thumbs up to the cameras. Mladić, who was commander of the Bosnian Serb army during the 1992-95 Bosnian conflict and for several years was one of the world’s most wanted fugitives, is now 74 and in poor health. His lawyers have argued he is not well enough to hear his verdict and sentence in person, but it is not clear whether they will seek a last-minute postponement. A judge has already rejected a defence effort earlier this month to have the judgment put off. The trial in The Hague, which took 530 days spread over more than four years, is arguably the most significant war crimes case in Europe since the Nuremberg tribunal, in part because of the scale of the atrocities involved. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) heard from 591 witnesses and examined nearly 10,000 exhibits concerning 106 separate crimes. Legal scholars say Mladić is almost certain to be found guilty of genocide for the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995, where more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were killed, most by summary execution. The Bosnian Serb political leader, Radovan Karadžić, was convicted of genocide last year for his role in the Srebrenica killings.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n From cricketer Wasim Akram to baseball pitcher Clayton Kershaw and table tennis star Ding Ning, the world of sport has no shortage of left-handed players. But now researchers say they’ve worked out why lefties are overrepresented in some elite sports but not others. The study, published in the journal Biology Letters, suggests that being left-handed is a particular advantage in interactive sports where time pressures are particularly severe, such as table tennis and cricket – possibly because their moves are less familiar to their mostly right-handed opponents, who do not have time to adjust. “The data suggests that the heavier the time constraints are operating in a sport, the larger the proportion of left-handers,” said the study’s author, Dr Florian Loffing of the University of Oldenburg in Germany. “We are less used to playing lefties, and [so] might end up in not developing the optimal strategies to compete with them.” While it is thought that about 10-13% of the population is left-handed, it has long been noted that in certain interactive sports there is often a surprisingly high proportion of left-handers playing at elite levels. Southpaw stars have seen significant success in sport, with big names including baseball aces Sandy Koufax and Randy Johnson, cricketers Garfield Sobers and Mitchell Johnson and table tennis’s Wang Nan and Kasumi Ishikawa. Previous research has punted a number of possible explanations, including that left-handers have more efficient connections between the two hemispheres of their brain. Others have suggested that lefties have the edge due to an element of surprise: since most players are right-handed, players will be more used to playing against right-handed partners. But the question remained: why did different sports show such different proportions of left-handed players? To probe the issue, Loffing collected the names and handedness of the top 100 or so players for badminton, squash, tennis, table tennis and – for men only – cricket and baseball, across six years between 2009 and 2014.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

It is conducted “with great sensitivity”. “The playing and choral singing are outstanding”.

The pace of the MSP’s new move has the appearance of premature remuneration.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n I was at the dress rehearsal of Marnie at the ENO which was received rapturously by the audience. What a pity that Tim Ashley’s review has such a dismissive heading (A psychological thriller that fails to deliver a thrill, 20 November) when in the review he says it is “superbly done”, praises the singers and their acting, and the staging for its “elegant fluidity”. It is conducted “with great sensitivity”. “The playing and choral singing are outstanding”. This may well put people off from going to see this challenging but fascinating new work – essentially for following the book rather than the Hitchcock film, something that the composer and librettist have made explicit. Sarah Carter Canterbury • A colleague speaking about his home country assured me: “In Pakistan politicians make money while in office whereas in the UK they do it after they leave.” Kezia Dugdale could show a bit more respect for this time-honoured tradition (Labour split as Dugdale joins reality TV show, 21 November). The pace of the MSP’s new move has the appearance of premature remuneration. Geoff Reid Bradford • Can anyone explain why Cornwall, the second poorest region in northern Europe (Letters, 18 November), has six Conservative MPs? Is this a textbook example of Marx’s false consciousness? David Kennedy Menston, West Yorkshire • Further to Tony Fletcher’s reference to “milky coffee” (Letters, 20 November), a coffee stall in a park in Edinburgh in the mid-19th century offered “café au lait, with or without milk”.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "response":"<<Simplifying News Text>>\n\nSection 1\nThe given text is a compilation of various reader's comments on articles published in the Guardian, each addressing a different topic. The first comment is about a musical performance titled \"Marnie\" at the English National Opera (ENO), which received a positive audience reception. The reviewer, Tim Ashley, initially gave a negative review with a dismissive headline. However, upon a closer look, the review actually praised the performance and praised its artistic aspects, ingredients such as conductor's sensitivity or the elegance of the staging. The concern is that people may be put off by the initial dismissive headline. \n\nThe next comment contrasts political practices in the UK and Pakistan, emphasizing that while Pakistani politicians traditionally make money while in office, their UK counterparts usually do so after leaving their posts. The commenter criticizes a UK politician, Kezia Dugdale, for what they perceive as an early shift to a high-paying job. \n\nThe third commentary questions the representation of Cornish voters in the British Parliament. With six Conservative MPs representing a relatively poor area, it leads people to question whether this fits Karl Marx's concept of 'false consciousness', meaning the populace is misled about their true interests. \n\nIn the fourth part, a recollection of a mid-19th-century coffee stall in Edinburgh is mentioned, which offered 'café au lait, with or without milk': a humorous document highlighting that the concept of 'milk in coffee' could be diverse even back then.\n\nIn simpler terms, the passage above is a series of commentaries on different articles in the Guardian.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Taylor Swift’s Reputation has become the biggest-selling album of the year in the US in a single week, with 1.23m sales. That total comfortably beats the 931,000 copies of ÷ sold by Ed Sheeran since he released it in early March. Swift has kept all but four songs from Reputation off streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, meaning that fans need to pay to download the album or buy it on CD if they want to hear it. She also, somewhat controversially, created a promotion where fans who bought multiple copies of the album increased their chances of getting tickets to her upcoming tour, thus further driving sales. Nielsen, which collates album sales data in the US, said that Reputation sold more copies than the rest of the top 200 albums put together. Swift’s previous three albums have all sold more than a million copies in the US in their first week– a feat increasingly difficult to achieve as the popularity of downloads and CDs continues to wane.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Taylor Swift’s Reputation has become the biggest-selling album of the year in the US in a single week, with 1.23m sales. That total comfortably beats the 931,000 copies of ÷ sold by Ed Sheeran since he released it in early March. Swift has kept all but four songs from Reputation off streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, meaning that fans need to pay to download the album or buy it on CD if they want to hear it. She also, somewhat controversially, created a promotion where fans who bought multiple copies of the album increased their chances of getting tickets to her upcoming tour, thus further driving sales. Nielsen, which collates album sales data in the US, said that Reputation sold more copies than the rest of the top 200 albums put together. Swift’s previous three albums have all sold more than a million copies in the US in their first week– a feat increasingly difficult to achieve as the popularity of downloads and CDs continues to wane. Her label Big Machine reported that a further 905,000 copies were sold worldwide, 84,000 of which were in the UK, which gives it the sixth-largest first week UK sales of the year, behind albums by Sam Smith, Liam Gallagher, Take That, Rag’N’Bone Man and Swift’s friend Ed Sheeran, who sold 671,000 copies of ÷ in the first week of its release.

    "response":"\"mention Taylor Swift’s new album, Reputation, became the best-selling music album of the U.S. in a single week, selling 1.23 million copies. This achievement is significant, especially because it surpassed the sales of Ed Sheeran’s album ÷ by a wide margin. Swift managed to boost her album sales by limiting access to streaming platforms and initiating a promotion that rewarded fans who purchased multiple copies with a better chance of gaining concert tickets. These strategies effectively drove up the album’s sales. Nielsen, a company that tracks album sales in the United States, has highlighted that the sales figures for Reputation outstripped all the other top 200 albums combined.\n\nSwift has a history of success with her albums, as her previous three releases each sold more than a million copies in their first week. However, achieving these kinds of sales is becoming increasingly challenging due to the declining popularity of physical album purchases and downloads. The global sales of Reputation were also substantial, with an additional 905,000 copies sold worldwide in the first week. In the UK market, it achieved the sixth-largest first-week sales of the year, although it was notably outperformed by Ed Sheeran’s album ÷ in terms of sales numbers during its opening week. Swift’s sales, though impressive, still fall short of the record set by Adele in 2015 for her album 25, which sold 3.37 million copies in its first week in the U.S.\n\nIn terms of financial earnings, Forbes Magazine ranked Swift as the third-highest earning female musician in 2017, with estimated earnings of $44 million. While this is a significant amount, it is notably less than the earnings of Beyoncé, who topped the list with earnings of $105 million, and Adele, who came in second with earnings of $69 million. Swift’s earnings were primarily driven by her concert tours, and while her record-breaking sales of Reputation are a strong indicator of her enduring popularity, they reflect the changing landscape of the music industry and the challenges faced by artists to maintain a high level of financial success.\n\nUnderstanding the context of Swift’s latest success, especially realising it amidst an era of declining album sales, brings to light the effective strategies she employed to captivate her audience and boost her album sales. Additionally, it’s noteworthy that the 2017 financial earnings of music stars, particularly for females, are largely driven by concert ticket sales, highlighting a shift from product-focused (album sales) to experience-focused (concert experiences) revenue models in the music industry.\"",

History lesson Kazan considers itself Russia’s “sporting capital” and the Kazan Arena is one of an impressive array of stylish, modern – and expensive – sporting facilities to have sprung up there in recent years. It was designed by Populous, the architects behind Wembley and the Emirates, and was built in time for the 2013 Summer Universiade, where it hosted football and athletics. As a sleek, modern facility it will serve the World Cup well – even if it will, amazingly, be one of the tournament’s oldest stadiums. Star attraction Anyone who gets lost en route should just look for the high-definition screen – the world’s biggest outdoor one, organisers proudly proclaim – on the side of the stadium. It covers 4,030 square metres and will probably bear both competing nations’ flags on a given matchday. Those arriving from the air may want to appreciate the waterlily-themed roof of this riverside stadium. Any hitches? Nothing major.

History lesson Kazan considers itself Russia’s “sporting capital” and the Kazan Arena is one of an impressive array of stylish, modern – and expensive – sporting facilities to have sprung up there in recent years. It was designed by Populous, the architects behind Wembley and the Emirates, and was built in time for the 2013 Summer Universiade, where it hosted football and athletics. As a sleek, modern facility it will serve the World Cup well – even if it will, amazingly, be one of the tournament’s oldest stadiums. Star attraction Anyone who gets lost en route should just look for the high-definition screen – the world’s biggest outdoor one, organisers proudly proclaim – on the side of the stadium. It covers 4,030 square metres and will probably bear both competing nations’ flags on a given matchday. Those arriving from the air may want to appreciate the waterlily-themed roof of this riverside stadium. Any hitches? Nothing major. The Confederations Cup was a successful dry run and the Russia v Iran friendly went off without any problems in October.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Apple has been accused of relying on students working illegal overtime to build the iPhone X, through its contractor Foxconn, which manufactures the devices in Zhengzhou, China. According to the Financial Times, students working at the Foxconn plant, as part of a three month “work experience” placement, were routinely working 11-hour days assembling the newest phone, breaking Chinese overtime laws in the process. Student labour is common, and legal, in manufacturing hubs in China. The students must be paid, and the placements must be voluntary, with the number of temporary workers swelling employment at the Zhengzhou factory threefold in the busiest time of the year, the paper reported. But, according to the Financial Times, such work experience should be limited to just 40 hours a week. Six high school students, out of a group of 3,000 from one vocational school sent to work at the factory, told the paper that those legal limits were exceeded. In a statement, Apple said: “During the course of a recent audit, we discovered instances of student interns working overtime at a supplier facility in China. We’ve confirmed the students worked voluntarily, were compensated and provided benefits, but they should not have been allowed to work overtime.” “At this facility, student intern programs are short term and account for a very small percentage of the workforce. When we found that some students were allowed to work overtime, we took prompt action. A team of specialists are on site at the facility working with the management on systems to ensure the appropriate standards are adhered to.” “Apple is dedicated to ensuring everyone in our supply chain is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

As a 24-year-old, I am so often forced to listen to my elders’ indignation for my choosing to take a holiday, or have a meal out with friends when every penny I earn should be saved for a house. When you consider increasing prices and decreasing availability of property in the UK, along with the banks’ appetites to lend being lower than ever, it’s unlikely I will ever own my own home. Perhaps I just need to accept that thousands of us are destined to spend the rest of our lives throwing all of our money at the people who own the properties we rent from them while they complain about how irresponsible we are. Sam Webb Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands • Have you heard about the massive discounts available for the under-25s? Unfortunately not; in reality the only thing reduced for us is our wages. Under-25s are excluded from the pitiful “national living wage”. From 21-24 we can be paid as little as £7.05 per hour, and for 18-20 a shocking £5.60 for doing exactly the same hours in exactly the same job. Even working full-time a 24-year-old might get as little as £14,500 per annum. And we’re far more likely to be on a zero-hours contract.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.  Your answer must contain exactly 5 bullet points.

As a 24-year-old, I am so often forced to listen to my elders’ indignation for my choosing to take a holiday, or have a meal out with friends when every penny I earn should be saved for a house. When you consider increasing prices and decreasing availability of property in the UK, along with the banks’ appetites to lend being lower than ever, it’s unlikely I will ever own my own home. Perhaps I just need to accept that thousands of us are destined to spend the rest of our lives throwing all of our money at the people who own the properties we rent from them while they complain about how irresponsible we are. Sam Webb Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands • Have you heard about the massive discounts available for the under-25s? Unfortunately not; in reality the only thing reduced for us is our wages. Under-25s are excluded from the pitiful “national living wage”. From 21-24 we can be paid as little as £7.05 per hour, and for 18-20 a shocking £5.60 for doing exactly the same hours in exactly the same job. Even working full-time a 24-year-old might get as little as £14,500 per annum.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n MPs have accused the government of failing to protect consumers over the price it has promised to pay for power from the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant. The Commons public accounts committee said the subsidy contract for Hinkley Point C, agreed in 2016 after years of delays, would hit poorest households hardest. The power station is expected to cost billpayers £30bn over the lengthy of the 35-year contract, adding £10-£15 to the average household energy bill. But an assessment by the committee concluded that no one in Whitehall was championing consumers’ interests during negotiations with French company EDF Energy. The final bill for consumers was exacerbated by government not renegotiating the guaranteed power price for fear that EDF and its Chinese partner CGN would walk away from the project, which the MPs said was a questionable assumption. Officials agreed a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour in 2013 but fossil fuel price projections fell between then and the contract being signed in 2016, pushing the cost to consumers up fivefold from £6bn to £30bn. At the time the Department of Energy and Climate Change – now the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy – did not consider a ceiling on the guaranteed price, the MPs were told. Meg Hillier, chair of the group of MPs, said: “Billpayers have been dealt a bad hand by the government in its approach to this project.” The criticism from the committee follows a damning report by the UK’s spending watchdog, the NAO, which found the contract for Hinkley had locked consumers into a “risky and expensive project”. The NAO attacked the government for failing to explore alternative financing models, such as taking stake in the project, a criticism that the MPs echoed. The public accounts committee said it was also disappointed that the government appeared to have no plan in place to maximise the wider benefits of the project, beyond the clean power it will provide.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n An Oxford graduate is suing the university for £1m on the grounds that his failure to get a top degree 17 years ago cost him the chance of a lucrative legal career. Faiz Siddiqui alleges the “inadequate” teaching he received on the Indian special subject part of his modern history course resulted in him getting only a low upper second degree when he took his finals in June 2000 instead of a first or high 2:1. Siddiqui, 39, has blamed the situation on a number of members of staff being absent on sabbatical leave and a failure to find cover. He has also alleged that a tutor failed to submit medical information about him to examiners. He claims he would have become an international commercial lawyer if he had gained the top qualification at the end of his time at Brasenose College, and that his clinical depression and insomnia have been significantly exacerbated by his “inexplicable failure”. The legal battle between Siddiqui and Oxford has been ongoing for more than a year. Last year a judge allowed Siddiqui’s action to proceed to be fully argued after Oxford claimed the case had no merit and had been brought outside the legal time limit. It was decided at the time that Siddiqui had a real chance of persuading a judge that the case was not time-barred or that it would be just for it to proceed in any event. At the high court in London on Tuesday, Siddiqui’s barrister, Roger Mallalieu, told Mr Justice Foskett that in 2000 Siddiqui was a “driven young man” aiming for a postgraduate qualification from an Ivy League university before a career at the tax bar in England or a major US law firm. “Whilst a 2:1 degree from Oxford might rightly seem like a tremendous achievement to most, it fell significantly short of Mr Siddiqui’s expectations and was, to him, a huge disappointment,” Mallalieu said.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n An Oxford graduate is suing the university for £1m on the grounds that his failure to get a top degree 17 years ago cost him the chance of a lucrative legal career. Faiz Siddiqui alleges the “inadequate” teaching he received on the Indian special subject part of his modern history course resulted in him getting only a low upper second degree when he took his finals in June 2000 instead of a first or high 2:1. Siddiqui, 39, has blamed the situation on a number of members of staff being absent on sabbatical leave and a failure to find cover. He has also alleged that a tutor failed to submit medical information about him to examiners. He claims he would have become an international commercial lawyer if he had gained the top qualification at the end of his time at Brasenose College, and that his clinical depression and insomnia have been significantly exacerbated by his “inexplicable failure”. The legal battle between Siddiqui and Oxford has been ongoing for more than a year. Last year a judge allowed Siddiqui’s action to proceed to be fully argued after Oxford claimed the case had no merit and had been brought outside the legal time limit. It was decided at the time that Siddiqui had a real chance of persuading a judge that the case was not time-barred or that it would be just for it to proceed in any event. At the high court in London on Tuesday, Siddiqui’s barrister, Roger Mallalieu, told Mr Justice Foskett that in 2000 Siddiqui was a “driven young man” aiming for a postgraduate qualification from an Ivy League university before a career at the tax bar in England or a major US law firm. “Whilst a 2:1 degree from Oxford might rightly seem like a tremendous achievement to most, it fell significantly short of Mr Siddiqui’s expectations and was, to him, a huge disappointment,” Mallalieu said.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "response":"SECTION 1\nThis Guardian article describes the situation of an individual named Faiz Siddiqui, who is suing Oxford University for £1 million. His claim is that a subpar performance in a specific subject during his final exams in 2000, which in turn resulted in him receiving a low upper second-class degree instead of a top degree, has cost him a lucrative legal career. \nSiddiqui attributes the inadequate performance to various factors, including the absence of several teaching staff due to sabbatical leaves and a tutor's failure to submit his medical records to the examiners. He believes that if he had obtained a first-class degree, he would've pursued a successful career in international commercial law and perhaps avoided severe depression and insomnia.\n\nSiddiqui's lawsuit against Oxford, having been ongoing for over a year, received a green light from a judge last year to proceed despite the university's claim that the case had no merit and was outside the legal time frame. His barrister, Roger Mallalieu, is now arguing before Mr. Justice Foskett.\n\nSECTION 2\nP.P.S: In simpler terms, imagine a brilliant student who believed a top degree would pave the way to his dreams. Due to some unfortunate circumstances during his university days and a less than expected degree, this student now believes he missed out on a high paying job and good health, for which he is suing Oxford University for £1 million. Despite the university's attempts to brush off his claim, the case is now being fully argued in court and a judge listens to the plaintiff's arguments.",

    "response":"<|begin_of_thought|> \nTo simplify these news article snippets, I'll analyze them paragraph by paragraph.\n\\n\\nThe first paragraph is about the show \"Blue Planet II,\" which airs on BBC One. It describes the show as a visually stunning underwater exploration, which is diving into the complexity of underwater plant life such as kelp and coral reefs. The show features images of animals and plant life that can seem like terrifying nightmares, with descriptions like a sea cucumber eating starfish. But it balances these with more heartwarming moments, for example a damselfish repressing threat from invaders and a cuttlefish making a move on a mate. This paragraph is a critical review of the show \"Blue Planet II,\" structured to express its positive aspects through vivid imagery and detailed descriptions.\n\\n\\nThe second paragraph is about a TV adaptation of E M Forster's \"Howards End.\" The review explains the plot of the show, indicating that the character Margaret gets engaged and life takes a turn for the worst immediately as a conflict arises. It introduces another character, Leonard Bast, who has faced harsh times due to the characters Schlegels' advice. It skilfully juxtaposes Margaret's engagement with Bast's struggle, presenting a complex narrative of joy and despair.\n\\n\\nThe third paragraph is about \"Expedition Volcano,\" a documentary show about scientists studying a volcanic mountain in Congo. The paragraph describes the risks and difficulty the team had to face when setting up camp at Mount Nyiragongo. It had dangerous elements like the risk of lava, and health issues. This paragraph talks about the scientific study, its dangers, and its objective, and it aims to highlight the dedication and risk undertaken by these scientists.\n\\n\\nFinally, the fourth paragraph is about an automobile and racing show, \"Guy Martin vs the Robot Car.\" Guy Martin, a well-known motorbike racer, races against a robot car in these shows.

    "filtered_answer":"<|begin_of_thought|> \nTo simplify these news article snippets, I'll analyze them paragraph by paragraph.\n\\n\\nThe first paragraph is about the show \"Blue Planet II,\" which airs on BBC One. It describes the show as a visually stunning underwater exploration, which is diving into the complexity of underwater plant life such as kelp and coral reefs. The show features images of animals and plant life that can seem like terrifying nightmares, with descriptions like a sea cucumber eating starfish. But it balances these with more heartwarming moments, for example a damselfish repressing threat from invaders and a cuttlefish making a move on a mate. This paragraph is a critical review of the show \"Blue Planet II,\" structured to express its positive aspects through vivid imagery and detailed descriptions.\n\\n\\nThe second paragraph is about a TV adaptation of E M Forster's \"Howards End.\" The review explains the plot of the show, indicating that the character Margaret gets engaged and life takes a turn for the worst immediately as a conflict arises. It introduces another character, Leonard Bast, who has faced harsh times due to the characters Schlegels' advice. It skilfully juxtaposes Margaret's engagement with Bast's struggle, presenting a complex narrative of joy and despair.\n\\n\\nThe third paragraph is about \"Expedition Volcano,\" a documentary show about scientists studying a volcanic mountain in Congo. The paragraph describes the risks and difficulty the team had to face when setting up camp at Mount Nyiragongo. It had dangerous elements like the risk of lava, and health issues. This paragraph talks about the scientific study, its dangers, and its objective, and it aims to highlight the dedication and risk undertaken by these scientists.\n\\n\\nFinally, the fourth paragraph is about an automobile and racing show, \"Guy Martin vs the Robot Car.\" Guy Martin, a well-known motorbike racer, races against a robot car in these shows. The article explains the big changes in the automotive industry and how it is challenging Martin's expertise. It ends with a hint of intrigue and mystery, suggesting that Guy Martin may be about to experience something completely new and groundbreaking.\n\\n\\nThroughout the thought process, the critical aspects of each article are understood and the information distilled in plain language to make it easier to understand.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Ten of the 12 water companies in the UK have admitted they are still using the practice of water dowsing despite the lack of scientific evidence for its effectiveness. The disclosure has prompted calls for the regulator to stop companies passing the cost of a discredited medieval practice on to their customers. Ofwat said any firm failing to meet its commitments to customers faced a financial penalty. Dowsers, or water witchers, claim that their divining rods cross over when the presence of water is detected below ground. It is regarded as a pseudoscience, after numerous studies showed it was no better than chance at finding water. Some water companies, however, insisted the practice could be as effective as modern methods. The discovery that firms were still using water diviners was made by the science blogger Sally Le Page, after her parents reported seeing an engineer from Severn Trent “walking around holding two bent tent pegs to locate a pipe” near their home in Stratford-upon-Avon. Le Page asked Severn Trent why it was still using divining rods to find pipes when there was no evidence that it worked. Replying on Twitter, the company said: “We’ve found that some of the older methods are just as effective than the new ones, but we do use drones as well, and now satellites.” Le Page then asked the other 11 water companies whether they were using water dowsing.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n St Andrew’s Day, which falls at the end of this month, is celebrated as the feast day of Scotland’s patron saint and a last hurrah before we disappear under an avalanche of mince pies and mulled wine. And if there’s one thing the Scots are good at, apart from politics, economics, terriers and whisky, it’s an honest broth. According to the Victorian journalist and author Christian Isobel Johnstone, who published her The Cook and Housewife’s Manual under the pseudonym Margaret Dods: “The French take the lead of all European people in soups and broths … the Scotch rank second, the Welsh next, and … the English, as a nation, are at the very bottom of the scale.” As an Edinburgh native, she may have been biased, but when one considers the likes of cullen skink, Scotch broth and our subject here, cock-a-leekie, it’s hard not to concede the point. The last, occasionally known as cockie-leekie, is often dated to the end of the 16th century, when the Lincolnshire-born traveller Fynes Moryson records having been served “pullet with some prunes in the broth” at a knight’s house in Scotland, although, given the widespread medieval tradition of meat and fruit pottages, it seems likely that similar dishes were once found throughout northern Europe – even (horror!) south of the border. Happily for us, however, this particular version remained popular in Scotland, and feels a pleasingly simple and wholesome celebratory dish to prepare the stomach for the month to come. The chicken As ever, many recipes call for what the redoubtable Maw Broon calls “an auld boiling fowl” (thanks to Twitter friend of the column Jon Dryden Taylor for supplying the recipe), which is, as we have seen previously, an appropriately tough thing to get hold of in 21st-century Britain. Catherine Brown reckons that “attempting a modern cock-a-leekie with an immature battery chicken is akin to attempting cassoulet without confit”, and, in the absence of decent chicken recommends using “a more flavourful pheasant or other game bird – cock or hen – which has roamed freely”. Having tried her recipe, I can confirm that pheasant makes a delicious soup, even when enjoyed from a bowl in a warm kitchen, rather than from a Thermos in the middle of a damp autumnal copse, but one with a distinct gamey character. Feel free to use pheasant here, if that’s what you have, but chicken, to some extent the older the better, remains the classic choice.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

In a statement, the CBS News president, David Rhodes, said his behavior was “extremely disturbing and intolerable”. “What may once have been accepted should not ever have been acceptable.” Rose said in a statement on Monday: “I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.” Asked if he has anything to say to the women who had accused him of “wrongdoings”, he replied: “It’s not wrongdoings.” Co-hosts of CBS This Morning Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell presented the show without their usual third team member, Rose, on Tuesday and broke away from their normal news reporting style to give raw, personal opinions on the behavior alleged against him. “This is a moment that demands a frank and honest assessment about where we stand and, more generally, the safety of women,” O’Donnell began. The show had opened with a straight news report on a story that now involved their own station. A CBS This Morning reporter related the facts that Rose, 75, had been suspended from his job while the company looks into detailed accusations from eight women that he had made unwanted sexual advances towards them, as revealed by the Washington Post. Allegations include lewd phone calls, walking around naked in their presence, or groping their breasts, buttocks or genital areas, and the women were employees or aspired to work for Rose at the Charlie Rose show from the late 1990s to 2011, the Post reported. “It takes a lot of courage for these women to come forward,” said O’Donnell.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n While indulging in booze can inspire cheerful merrymaking in some, for others it can lead to a tearful journey to the bottom of the glass. Now researchers say the emotions people feel when drinking could be linked to their tipple of choice. An international survey has revealed that spirits are often associated with feelings of energy, confidence and sexiness – but on the flip-side anger and tearfulness – while red wine is the drink most commonly linked to relaxation, but also tiredness. While the researchers say the reasons for the links are likely to be complex, they hope the study will urge individuals to think carefully about the alcohol they consume. “From a public health perspective a lot of the time we have focused on issues around cancer, heart disease and liver disease – but an important aspect is the balance of emotional outcomes that people are getting from alcohol,” said Mark Bellis, co-author of the research from Public Health Wales NHS Trust. The study, published in the journal BMJ Open, is based on an anonymous online questionnaire that was completed by individuals aged between 18 and 34 who had drunk alcohol in the previous year. Part of an international survey on alcohol and drug use, the questions probed the type of alcohol drunk and associated emotions, and were asked in 11 different languages, with participants taking part from 21 countries around the world. The results, based on answers from almost 30,000 participants who had reported consuming both red and white wine as well as beer and spirits in the past year, reveal that certain types of alcoholic drink appear to be linked to particular emotions. Almost 53% of participants said drinking red wine made them feel relaxed – an emotion that was also linked to beer by nearly 50% of participants, and white wine by nearly 33%. By contrast, spirits were linked to feelings of confidence by just over 59% of participants, energy by more than 58% and sexiness by just over 42%.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In 2005, before Hurricane Katrina, or the subprime mortgage crisis, or the succession of the first black president by a reality TV star braggart, Jeffrey Eugenides wrote: “One’s country was like oneself, the more you learned about it, the more there was to be ashamed about.” That sentence constitutes the dark heart of a sly yet pathos-packed tale called “Great Experiment” in Fresh Complaint, his recently published first collection of short stories. Twelve years on, surely American national shame is greater than any personal shame? “Oh it’s gotta be equal,” Eugenides sighs. “We all have a slave history past,” and then he laughs sadly. “I think that kind of inventory is endless in both directions – personally and nationally. Right now, perhaps it’s easier to pay attention to the national side of things, but they kind of go hand in hand, don’t they? There are going to be personal blots that plague you as you try to figure out how to negotiate and navigate current events and meet your fellow citizen on the street. A nation is just a bunch of people, so all the problems that happen in the nation are personal, on some level.” He’s speaking in a library in a new building on the campus of Princeton University, where Eugenides, who is now 57, has taught for a decade. The building is not quite finished: with a proper sign yet to come, someone has scrawled “unisex” on a sheet of paper and taped it to the toilet door – a reminder of how much campus life, if not US life at large, has changed in the last 10 years. When Eugenides was on tour for his novel Middlesex, which won the Pulitzer prize in 2003 and remains the most beloved by his readers, he often had to explain what “intersex” meant.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In 2005, before Hurricane Katrina, or the subprime mortgage crisis, or the succession of the first black president by a reality TV star braggart, Jeffrey Eugenides wrote: “One’s country was like oneself, the more you learned about it, the more there was to be ashamed about.” That sentence constitutes the dark heart of a sly yet pathos-packed tale called “Great Experiment” in Fresh Complaint, his recently published first collection of short stories. Twelve years on, surely American national shame is greater than any personal shame? “Oh it’s gotta be equal,” Eugenides sighs. “We all have a slave history past,” and then he laughs sadly. “I think that kind of inventory is endless in both directions – personally and nationally. Right now, perhaps it’s easier to pay attention to the national side of things, but they kind of go hand in hand, don’t they? There are going to be personal blots that plague you as you try to figure out how to negotiate and navigate current events and meet your fellow citizen on the street. A nation is just a bunch of people, so all the problems that happen in the nation are personal, on some level.” He’s speaking in a library in a new building on the campus of Princeton University, where Eugenides, who is now 57, has taught for a decade. The building is not quite finished: with a proper sign yet to come, someone has scrawled “unisex” on a sheet of paper and taped it to the toilet door – a reminder of how much campus life, if not US life at large, has changed in the last 10 years. When Eugenides was on tour for his novel Middlesex, which won the Pulitzer prize in 2003 and remains the most beloved by his readers, he often had to explain what “intersex” meant.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The use of the marker 'unisex', says much about changing attitudes towards health and gender on campus and potentially in the larger society. The great tension between changing and stagnant attitudes is a welcome reminder of how we navigate our personal responsibilities within the broader societal context. The awareness of intersex conditions can be viewed as part of the ongoing expansion of knowledge and acceptance, a similar tension between ignorance and enlightenment seen in the narrative of national and personal shame. In simpler terms, just as a relationship grows and evolves with understanding and acceptance of your girlfriend, so does a nation with its varied communities.

However, he observes that signal failures are now a daily occurrence. He is wondering if this new technology is causing more problems than it's solving or if his memory might be flawed. Readers are encouraged to share their thoughts and views on the matter.\n\nAny other questions?",

Yet from poinsettias to potted Christmas trees, many of these festive favourites can be extremely hard to keep alive in the conditions of the average living room for just a few weeks, let alone year to year. There is, however, a really old-school, and often overlooked, seasonal houseplant that is made from much tougher stuff: the beautiful and exotic Christmas cactus (Schlumbergera truncata and S x buckleyi). These two species (which look so similar that they share a common name) hail from the cool mountains of southeastern Brazil, where they are pollinated by hummingbirds. Unusually for a cactus, they aren’t a desert plant, but have adapted to grow on the boughs of tall rainforest trees, festooning their branches with weeping foliage and dazzling flowers. This relatively cool-weather habitat is surprisingly similar to the conditions of our British living rooms, making them perfectly adapted to thrive in hanging baskets or trail over windowsills everywhere. But what does a cactus have to do with Christmas? Not a great deal, really. In fact, in their native habitat their winter-flowering period doesn’t even coincide with Christmas. However, fortunately for gardeners like me, their habit of bursting into the most spectacular of floral displays from November to January occurs just when I need it most.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Boris Johnson and Michael Gove promised Brexit would release an extra £350m a week for the NHS. Now they’ve given the green light to Theresa May to double her offer to settle our obligations to the EU, to a rumoured £40bn. Meanwhile, tomorrow’s budget is likely to confirm that the health service is being starved of funds. But that’s not the end of the story. When the final Brexit bill comes in, it is likely to reach about £80bn – double the prime minister’s latest offer. Not that the government will come clean on this, as it is trying to head off a backlash by Tory backbenchers unhappy that even the £40bn agreed at yesterday’s Brexit cabinet subcommittee is too much. If they realised how much we are going to end up paying, they really would go “bananas” as one MP put it. The government is hoping to defuse opposition from within its own ranks by suggesting the money will come with strings attached: it will be conditional on the EU agreeing a good trade deal or, more realistically, at least agreeing to talk about a future trade deal. May’s new offer could be enough to break the deadlock in the talks at next month’s crucial summit – provided she doesn’t say it’s a “final offer” or add unrealistic conditions to it. After all, the other EU countries have said they will be prepared to move on to talking about our future relationship once “sufficient progress” has been made on the three key divorce issues: money, citizens’ rights and Ireland.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.
