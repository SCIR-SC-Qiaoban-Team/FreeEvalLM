      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n It was the frog that pushed me over the edge. I’ve never been a Harry Potter fan myself – I was already out of kids’ books when they first came out, and those clever grown-up covers weren’t enough to tempt me back – but I’d always admired JK Rowling from afar. Who wouldn’t? A writer whose imagination transfixed the world, whose riches now exceed those of the Queen, but who has founded a children’s charity, pays her taxes in full, and remains both poised and politically engaged: as role models go, it is hard to think of a better one. So I was pleased when my seven-year-old son went Harry Potter crazy. Having never read to himself before, he was suddenly racing through book after book, his bedside light on late into the night. His brother and several of his friends caught the bug – just as the Suez canal flowed through Clarissa Eden’s drawing room, Hogwarts overshadowed our house, as children constantly dashed about on broomsticks, casting spells and looking for snitches. It was impressive to see the “Harry Potter effect” in action: the magical power that, in the two decades since its first publication, has revitalised the children’s publishing industry, encouraged millions of children to read, sold more than 400m copies across the world, and generated a cultural empire worth £20bn. Less pleasant, however, was the realisation that there was a marketing juggernaut poised to capitalise on my son’s enthusiasm. Unlike those first readers 20 years ago, the children discovering Harry Potter now are immediately faced with a multibillion-pound industry trading in Potter-themed “experiences” and paraphernalia.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Featuring the work of high-profile and amateur designers, in campaign billboards, T-shirts and cartoons, it will show graphic design’s power as a tool for political discussion, debate and provocation. • Opens 28 March, Design Museum, London.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Cheyenne Mangold’s hands shook ever so slightly as she reached with a long metal instrument to catch hold of what looked like the cervix. The medical student was attempting, for the very first time, the rudiments of performing an abortion. As she inexpertly brought the pincers together on the soft flesh, you might have expected a little yelp of pain from the patient. There was silence.

The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron’s 2005 efforts to show the Tories cared about global warming. Ahead of this week’s climate change summit in Paris, May said: “There is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.” She described coal as “one of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power” and hailed the “enormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents”. May’s commitment to the issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real. However, the prime minister insists “tackling climate change and mitigating its effects for the world’s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces”. At the summit she will announce a £140m boost to funding for poorer communities affected by climate change through deforestation or vulnerability to natural disasters and extreme weather, plus £15m of additional support for reconstruction on Dominica in the Caribbean, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. It comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being asked by party officials to show off their green credentials after internal polling showed the level of concern among younger voters about environmental issues. The party has been alarmed by the backlash against May’s support for a free vote on foxhunting, the omission of a ban on the ivory trade from the manifesto and its lack of support for an amendment that would have recognised in UK law that animals feel pain.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Vladimir Putin has declared mission accomplished for Russian forces in the fight against Islamic State in Syria, as he made a surprise visit to the Russian airbase in the country. “Friends, the motherland is waiting for you,” Putin told the Russian air force detachment based at the Khmeimim airbase during his visit on Monday morning. “You are coming back home with victory.” Earlier this month, the head of the Russian army said Syria had been entirely liberated from Isis forces. Putin said a significant part of Russian forces would be withdrawn from Syria, though scepticism was warranted given that two previous announcements have been met with little noticeable scaling down. This time, however, could be different. Talk of the total defeat of Isis may be premature, but there is no doubt that Russian air power, combined with Syrian forces and Iran-backed Shia militias on the ground, has decisively shifted the balance of power in the long Syrian civil war. President Bashar al-Assad was on the brink of defeat when Russia entered the conflict in 2015. With sustained airstrikes on both moderate rebel groups and extremists, Moscow has helped Assad win back control of much of the country. The Russian and Syrian air forces were accused of brutal bombing tactics, including deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure, which the Russian military has always denied. Assad’s departure from office, long demanded by western powers, is no longer on the immediate agenda.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  There should be 1 paragraphs.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Vladimir Putin has declared mission accomplished for Russian forces in the fight against Islamic State in Syria, as he made a surprise visit to the Russian airbase in the country. “Friends, the motherland is waiting for you,” Putin told the Russian air force detachment based at the Khmeimim airbase during his visit on Monday morning. “You are coming back home with victory.” Earlier this month, the head of the Russian army said Syria had been entirely liberated from Isis forces. Putin said a significant part of Russian forces would be withdrawn from Syria, though scepticism was warranted given that two previous announcements have been met with little noticeable scaling down. This time, however, could be different. Talk of the total defeat of Isis may be premature, but there is no doubt that Russian air power, combined with Syrian forces and Iran-backed Shia militias on the ground, has decisively shifted the balance of power in the long Syrian civil war. President Bashar al-Assad was on the brink of defeat when Russia entered the conflict in 2015. With sustained airstrikes on both moderate rebel groups and extremists, Moscow has helped Assad win back control of much of the country. The Russian and Syrian air forces were accused of brutal bombing tactics, including deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure, which the Russian military has always denied. Assad’s departure from office, long demanded by western powers, is no longer on the immediate agenda.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  There should be 1 paragraphs.

He tells me there is “a ton of research” to show that New Year resolutions are an effective way to make changes: they create a sense of expectation and ceremony, while the link to a particular day helps to fit our experiences into a narrative of before and after, which makes change more likely. “There are people who will decide on 1 January to lose two stone and who will keep it off for the rest of their lives, others who have been smoking two packs a day for over a decade who will decide to quit and who will still not smoke this time next year,” he says.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Despite this, the Conservative Party leadership remains firm on setting the date for Brexit as 29 March 2019 and on not allowing a meaningful vote on the terms of the final deal before that date. A Conservative MP stated that the current situation is dire because enough dissatisfied Conservatives, along with Labour, SNP, and Liberal Democrat members, could challenge the government. However, May believes she has managed to convince her backbencher MPs to not defy her by promising that a vote will likely occur well before the departure date and that a second vote on implementing the EU withdrawal agreement will be held. The level of rebellion among Conservative MPs will become clearer during the two days of debate and voting on the EU withdrawal bill. While up to 25 Conservative MPs initially threatened to revolt over the lack of scrutiny, May’s concessions seemed to quiet their concerns. The government is also agreeing to establish a new committee to help prevent overuse of \"Henry VIII powers,\" which allow ministers to amend secondary legislation as it is converted.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n International affairs Iran nuclear deal, 15 January We should know by mid-January how serious Donald Trump is about seeking a confrontation with Iran over its nuclear programme. The US president refused in October to continue to certify the 2015 multilateral agreement under which Tehran accepted strict curbs on its activities in return for sanctions relief. Trump said that either Congress or US allies should fix the “serious flaws” in the deal, or he would “terminate it. The Senate has since opted out of dealing with the matter, and Washington’s allies have insisted that the 2015 agreement cannot be renegotiated. If Trump refuses to sign a six-monthly presidential waiver due on 15 January, nuclear-related sanctions against Iran will no longer be suspended and the US will be in violation of agreement. The other signatories, including the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China, would then have to decide whether to try to carry on without the US or allow the agreement to collapse. Either way, the Trump administration would have taken a very significant step toward open confrontation. Winter Olympics, 9 February The Winter Olympics in South Korea will be both a festival of sport and a test of the increasingly fragile peace in the region. If the war of words between Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is defused, the Olympics could offer the opportunity for a thaw. Seoul has suggested a lull in joint manoeuvres with the US during the Games, potentially opening the way for dialogue.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n International affairs Iran nuclear deal, 15 January We should know by mid-January how serious Donald Trump is about seeking a confrontation with Iran over its nuclear programme. The US president refused in October to continue to certify the 2015 multilateral agreement under which Tehran accepted strict curbs on its activities in return for sanctions relief. Trump said that either Congress or US allies should fix the “serious flaws” in the deal, or he would “terminate it. The Senate has since opted out of dealing with the matter, and Washington’s allies have insisted that the 2015 agreement cannot be renegotiated. If Trump refuses to sign a six-monthly presidential waiver due on 15 January, nuclear-related sanctions against Iran will no longer be suspended and the US will be in violation of agreement. The other signatories, including the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China, would then have to decide whether to try to carry on without the US or allow the agreement to collapse. Either way, the Trump administration would have taken a very significant step toward open confrontation. Winter Olympics, 9 February The Winter Olympics in South Korea will be both a festival of sport and a test of the increasingly fragile peace in the region. If the war of words between Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is defused, the Olympics could offer the opportunity for a thaw. Seoul has suggested a lull in joint manoeuvres with the US during the Games, potentially opening the way for dialogue.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

However, if America’s love for cultural trends is any indicator, the NBA might soon overtake the NFL.* This shift in preference is not because of the athletes' skills, passion, or dedication. Instead, sports can reflect society's values and become emblematic of them, in part due to their inspirational and entertaining qualities. *Professional sports serve as a mirror reflecting our cultural values and aspirations.* Given these dynamics, while football might currently be at the edge, basketball, with its constant innovations, could push it to the bag, taking the lead as America’s favorite sport.\n\n* Fans often view football as America's favorite sport due to its traditional standing and high viewer numbers, especially during high-profile games like the Super Bowl.*\n* The changing dynamics suggest that entertainment and fan engagement are crucial factors in the long-term popularity of a sport, presenting new opportunities for the NBA to gain ground.*\n* It is important to note that while the NFL remains popular, the cultural currents may soon turn, making the NBA a significant competitor.*\n\nP.S. The use of the terms ['bag', 'edge', 'kiss', 'passenger', 'wear'] in this context seems to emphasize the shifting nature of popularity in sports and how critical it is for professional athletes and leagues to adapt to changing fan preferences to maintain or gain a competitive edge.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The career of Keith Chegwin, who has died aged 60, is characterised by having presented both one of the most popular children’s TV shows in history and a contender for the medium’s most notorious adult entertainment. Viewers saw the best of him in Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (BBC1, 1976-82) and its successor, Saturday Superstore (1982-87), on which Chegwin became an honorary big brother to several generations of goggle-eyed British children, through his cheeky grin and giggle, high-pitched Liverpudlian-accented enthusiasm, and psychedelic knitwear. His presentational worst occurred when Chegwin threw off the novelty sweaters – and, indeed, all clothing except a hat – to front the naturist show Naked (Channel 5, 2000), described by a parliamentarian at the time as the “most disgusting programme ever shown” on British TV. But, while he should be remembered for the work he did with his jolly jumpers on, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for Chegwin, even in his most desperate televisual enterprises. This was due to a natural likability. Only the most sympathetic TV presenters earn nicknames from viewers, and, just as Bruce Forsyth transmuted into “Brucie”, Chegwin rapidly and indelibly became “Cheggers”. That identity was cemented by the title of the third huge success of his children’s career: the music-based gameshow, Cheggers Plays Pop (BBC1, 1978-86), which extended his presenting empire to weekdays. In less prosperous times, though, audiences also admired the impressive and affecting determination with which Cheggers, in the three decades after his Saturday morning career ended, tried to reinvent himself, often against considerable odds. In addition to a common problem for children’s presenters – becoming too old to maintain the required fantasy-sibling dynamic – Chegwin suffered health problems, including alcoholism. Apart from the established presenter-rehab route of reality TV – appearing on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity MasterChef – Chegwin also offered ironic spins on his showbiz rise and fall in 10 projects, including Ricky Gervais’s Extras and Life’s Too Short, and Kill Keith (2011), an improbable comedy-horror Brit film spoof of Tarantino’s Kill Bill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Generally, the trick in storytelling is to make the reader forget about the building blocks of language, and concentrate on the larger structure.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is to launch plans for an opt-out system of organ donation, asking people to overcome their “fatal reluctance” to discuss the issue with family and friends. Under the plans, everybody in England would be presumed to be happy to donate their organs on their death, unless they have signed up to a register stating that they do not want that to happen. In practice, however, it is unlikely that organs would be taken against the wishes of the family. The government’s ambition to change the NHS organ donation programme was announced by Theresa May in her Conservative party conference speech in October. Last year, she said, “500 people died because a suitable organ was not available. And there are 6,500 on the transplant list today.” NHS Blood and Transplant’s figures show that 1,100 families in the UK decided not to allow organ donation because they were unsure, or did not know whether their relatives would have wanted to donate an organ or not. “Every day, three people die for want of a transplant, which is why our historic plans to transform the way organ donation works are so important. We want as many people as possible to have their say as we shape the new opt-out process,” said Hunt. “As well as changing the law, we also need to change the conversation – it can be a difficult subject to broach, but overcoming this fatal reluctance to talk openly about our wishes is key to saving many more lives in the future.” The consultation will ask three questions: how much say should families have in their deceased relative’s decision to donate their organs? When would exemptions to “opt-out” be needed, and what safeguards will be necessary?\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Answer with less than 271 words.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is to launch plans for an opt-out system of organ donation, asking people to overcome their “fatal reluctance” to discuss the issue with family and friends. Under the plans, everybody in England would be presumed to be happy to donate their organs on their death, unless they have signed up to a register stating that they do not want that to happen. In practice, however, it is unlikely that organs would be taken against the wishes of the family. The government’s ambition to change the NHS organ donation programme was announced by Theresa May in her Conservative party conference speech in October. Last year, she said, “500 people died because a suitable organ was not available. And there are 6,500 on the transplant list today.” NHS Blood and Transplant’s figures show that 1,100 families in the UK decided not to allow organ donation because they were unsure, or did not know whether their relatives would have wanted to donate an organ or not. “Every day, three people die for want of a transplant, which is why our historic plans to transform the way organ donation works are so important. We want as many people as possible to have their say as we shape the new opt-out process,” said Hunt. “As well as changing the law, we also need to change the conversation – it can be a difficult subject to broach, but overcoming this fatal reluctance to talk openly about our wishes is key to saving many more lives in the future.” The consultation will ask three questions: how much say should families have in their deceased relative’s decision to donate their organs? When would exemptions to “opt-out” be needed, and what safeguards will be necessary?\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Answer with less than 271 words.

For those who think so little about her to the point they don’t even know who she is, allow me to catch you up. Ratajkowski is, well, I guess one would call her a model, but it’s a little more complicated than that. She is best known for appearing in the video for Robin Thicke’s once ubiquitous and now totally forgotten 2013 song, Blurred Lines, and since then she has done some acting but primarily made a career out of looking sexy. And sure, why not? You live your life, Emily. Ratajkowski has always made a lot of hay about saying that she’s a feminist, and good for her! Always nice to see a young woman in the public eye embrace the label as opposed to spewing out some moronic brain porridge, such as, “I’m not a feminist – I love men” (side eyes, Shailene Woodley).\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Samantha, by email Here’s what I think about Emily Ratajkowski: I think we should all think a lot less about Emily Ratajkowski. For those who think so little about her to the point they don’t even know who she is, allow me to catch you up. Ratajkowski is, well, I guess one would call her a model, but it’s a little more complicated than that. She is best known for appearing in the video for Robin Thicke’s once ubiquitous and now totally forgotten 2013 song, Blurred Lines, and since then she has done some acting but primarily made a career out of looking sexy. And sure, why not? You live your life, Emily. Ratajkowski has always made a lot of hay about saying that she’s a feminist, and good for her! Always nice to see a young woman in the public eye embrace the label as opposed to spewing out some moronic brain porridge, such as, “I’m not a feminist – I love men” (side eyes, Shailene Woodley).\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

It’s not in the lifestyle choices she made – living in New York one year, relocating to a home right on a California beach another – and it’s not in the interactions she had with Hollywood royalty, from Warren Beatty (who had a crush on her) to Harrison Ford (who worked as her carpenter for a time).

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n When Carla Bruni, the Italian-born, French-raised heiress and supermodel quit the catwalk to reinvent herself as a singer-songwriter 20 years ago, many thought it would be short-lived dilettantism. Yet Bruni surprised her detractors, showing herself to be a talented songwriter and a careful, nuanced singer whose jazzy chansons soon topped the French charts. She has continued to do so, even after the inevitable hiatus to her musical career caused by marrying Nicolas Sarkozy, and spending 2008-12 in the Élysée as France’s first lady. She has spoken of suffering from crippling stage fright, but this still-gamine figure, fronting a four-piece, light-jazz band, exudes preternatural poise.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n When Carla Bruni, the Italian-born, French-raised heiress and supermodel quit the catwalk to reinvent herself as a singer-songwriter 20 years ago, many thought it would be short-lived dilettantism. Yet Bruni surprised her detractors, showing herself to be a talented songwriter and a careful, nuanced singer whose jazzy chansons soon topped the French charts. She has continued to do so, even after the inevitable hiatus to her musical career caused by marrying Nicolas Sarkozy, and spending 2008-12 in the Élysée as France’s first lady. She has spoken of suffering from crippling stage fright, but this still-gamine figure, fronting a four-piece, light-jazz band, exudes preternatural poise. Bruni moves with beatific grace, recalling Karl Lagerfeld’s praise of her as “this beautiful creature who can wear anything”; her husky whisper could be a parody of a breathy Gallic siren.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Guillermo del Toro’s cold war fantasy The Shape of Water emerged as the frontrunner for the Oscars after picking up a total of seven nominations for the 75th Golden Globes. However, the film looks set to face strong opposition from Steven Spielberg’s Pentagon Papers drama The Post and Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, at a Globes ceremony that will provide the entertainment industry with its first major opportunity to respond to the sexual abuse scandal plaguing Hollywood. Two months after the emergence of allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein that would prompt a further torrent of claims against men in the film industry, the nominations exhibited an already changed landscape in Hollywood. As expected none of the Weinstein-produced films eligible for inclusion received nominations, however there were multiple nominations for Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World, which was forced to replace star Kevin Spacey at short notice, after he was accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and harassment. At the same time, the widely predicted shift towards a more female-focused list of nominees in the wake of the Weinstein scandal did not materialise. Though there were nods for a number of films with female protagonists, including The Shape of Water, Three Billboards, I, Tonya, a biopic of disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding and coming-of-age comedy-drama Lady Bird, there was no room in the nominees for any female directors, while Patty Jenkins’s feminist superhero movie Wonder Woman was snubbed entirely. Leading the way with seven nominations is the Shape of Water, which stars British actor Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaner at a governmental research facility who falls in love with a captured sea creature. Both Del Toro and Hawkins have been nominated in the drama category, for best director and best actress respectively, while Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer have received supporting actor and actress nominations. The film has also received best screenplay and score nominations, as well as best picture in the drama category. It is joined in that latter category by 70s-set drama The Post, which stars Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep as Washington Post higher-ups who clash over whether to publish classified documents about the war in Vietnam.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Leading the way with seven nominations is the Shape of Water, which stars British actor Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaner at a governmental research facility who falls in love with a captured sea creature. Both Del Toro and Hawkins have been nominated in the drama category, for best director and best actress respectively, while Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer have received supporting actor and actress nominations. The film has also received best screenplay and score nominations, as well as best picture in the drama category. It is joined in that latter category by 70s-set drama The Post, which stars Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep as Washington Post higher-ups who clash over whether to publish classified documents about the war in Vietnam.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"The film \"The Shape of Water,\" directed by Guillermo del Toro, secured the most nominations at the 75th Golden Globe Awards, earning a total of seven recognitions, with Guillermo del Toro himself nominated for best director. The movie follows the story of a mute cleaner at a government research facility who develops a unique bond with a captured aquatic creature. Complementing the lead and supporting actors Sally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins are the nominations for another strong performance by Octavia Spencer and a superb screenplay and music score.\n\nIn direct competition with \"The Shape of Water\" is \"The Post,\" a film directed by Steven Spielberg about the Washington Post staff members who debate publishing information about the Vietnam War. Alongside this, Martin McDonagh's \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" also garners substantial attention with multiple nominations. This year's Golden Globe ceremony provides an important platform for the entertainment industry to reflect on and perhaps respond to the ongoing sexual misconduct allegations within the film industry. While none of Harvey Weinstein's films were nominated, Ridley Scott’s \"All the Money in the World,\" which was relaunched after replacing Kevin Spacey, secured multiple nominations.\n\nDespite the Weinstein scandal and expectations of a more balanced gender representation at the awards, only a handful of female-focused films and actresses received recognition. Films such as \"The Shape of Water,\" \"Three Billboards,\" \"I, Tonya,\" and \"Lady Bird\" were acknowledged, but notably missing were nods for the female directors and \"Wonder Woman.\"\n\nP.P.S The nominations reflect a significant reshaping of the film landscape in wake of the powerful revelations against Harvey Weinstein, yet also show that challenges in gender representation still persist in the film industry.",

    "response":"SECTION 1\nA critical insight into fostering creativity can be observed in a Denver, Colorado, art classroom, where students are guided to replicate the abstract styles of Vassily Kandinsky. While the initial task involves mimicking Kandinsky's geometric compositions and applying brush techniques and color theory, the educational approach extends beyond a mere study of art history. The unique twist in the lesson lies in the subsequent instruction for students to dismantle their paintings and reassemble them into three-dimensional sculptures. Through this exercise, each student begins with a common source material—Kandinsky’s work—but the final outcomes of their artistic creations vary dramatically. Some pieces emerge as straight columns, whilst others emerge as fragmented, angular assemblages. This methodology emphasizes that creativity is not a solitary venture, but rather a process of building upon and extending existing ideas. Creativity, therefore, is not solely a matter of imagination, but of leveraging and transforming the known to create something fresh and novel. This approach underscores the idea that original ideas are rarely, if ever, \"outsiders\" or entirely devoid of precedent. Instead, they emerge from a rich tapestry of influences, both historical and contemporary, which serve as the foundation for innovative thought and expression. It instills in students the importance of engaging with and contextualizing the past, not as a fixed endpoint, but as a dynamic starting point for exploration and creation. By understanding that every new idea is fundamentally a synthesis of what has come before, students are encouraged to see the potential for endless innovation and artistic growth. In essence, this teaching method illuminates the cyclical nature of creativity, demonstrating how inspiration can flow from the examined and the known to the novel and the undiscovered.",

Another story, \"Project for a Trip to China,\" is more of a personal narrative, revealing her childhood, reading habits, and her father's work in China. This piece is experimental, employing techniques such as lists, tables, and using initials to identify characters.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n To non-vegans, the idea of a plant-based Christmas dinner may smack of Scrooge crouched over a miserly candle, sucking on a single slice of tofu. There are few holidays more dedicated to tearing up the five-a-day-guidelines than this one, so if you take away not only the meat but the cream, then what’s left? Actually, this year there’s a lot left, as supermarkets are increasingly wise to the idea that plenty of vegans want to stuff their faces, too. With estimates that between 2 and 12% of British people now follow a vegetarian diet, it’s unsurprising that a vegetarian Christmas is well catered for by shops, but the rise of the “flexitarian” means that even non-vegans may buy and try vegan now, if it’s an option. It takes a bit of supermarket-hopping and a familiarity with an online checkout to do it, but with a little effort, there’s now a gluttonous array of choice. Christmas dinner is a roast with bits added on, and the majority of a roast is vegan anyway. There are a few tweaks that may need to be made – use oil to roast the potatoes instead of fat; swap butter for olive oil in the mash, and leave honey off the parsnips and carrots (you could swap in maple or agave syrup for sweetness). When it comes to the star of the show, the amount of effort you’re willing to put in will dictate your centrepiece. The ever-reliable Linda McCartney range’s new “roast beef” joint comes with a boozy-tasting red wine glaze and a remarkably beef-like flavour, which is great for vegans who like the taste of meat but not the methods, though it may be too meaty for some. Fry’s soy and quinoa Country Roast is a solid herby veggie roast, while Tofurky’s turkey and stuffing is a respectable substitute for the real thing.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The rather unexpected allusion by the prime minister this week in a speech to the Business Council of Australia to the government’s pursuit of further income tax cuts is not one that should be treated with too much respect until he also talks about how to pay for them. With the return to surplus built on income tax revenue, any income tax cuts are unlikely to come before the next decade without either increases in other taxes or big cuts to government services. Amid the usual “free markets are great” rah-rah that the prime minister doled out to the Business Council of Australia on Monday night, Malcolm Turnbull also slipped in a line on income tax cuts, noting that he was: “Actively working with the treasurer and all my cabinet colleagues to ease the burden on middle-income Australians, while also meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” This was a bit of a surprise given the current state of the budget is such that the government is projecting that a return to surplus only in 2020-21and that net debt at that point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP. Even in the best of times, promising income tax cuts as the budget is in deficit is a courageous position to take for a political party that likes to prides itself on “budget responsibility”.It is even more courageous when the path back to surplus is built on a foundation of income tax revenue. Individual’s income tax has always been the biggest tax in the budget. During the mining-boom years it declined slightly in importance as company tax exploded in value from 3.3% of GDP in 1998-99 to5.3% of GDP in 2005-06. But in the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for just over half of all tax revenue. Now that in itself is a bit of a problem (the IMF and OECD have made calls for Australia to lessen its reliance on income tax) but it is a bigger problem for Turnbull and his call for tax cuts while also “meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” The issue it that of the extra $88.1bn in tax revenue the government hopes to gain between now and 2020-21, $48.5bn of it is to come from individual income tax. This means that income tax is actually bearing a greater burden of the increase in tax than would be expected. Income tax makes up 50.6% of total tax revenue, but accounts for 55% of the increase in tax revenue between now and 2020-21.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

With the return to surplus built on income tax revenue, any income tax cuts are unlikely to come before the next decade without either increases in other taxes or big cuts to government services. Amid the usual “free markets are great” rah-rah that the prime minister doled out to the Business Council of Australia on Monday night, Malcolm Turnbull also slipped in a line on income tax cuts, noting that he was: “Actively working with the treasurer and all my cabinet colleagues to ease the burden on middle-income Australians, while also meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” This was a bit of a surprise given the current state of the budget is such that the government is projecting that a return to surplus only in 2020-21and that net debt at that point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP.

    "response":"Technology has a significant role in modern economic governance, with politicians often using economic speeches to signal future intentions and policies. However, when Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull mentioned tax cuts in his recent Business Council of Australia speech, his words came with a notable caveat that such cuts would require further discussion about how they would be funded. Turnbull’s announcement was surprising, given that the government is still on track to return to a budget surplus in just two years, but at a cost that includes substantial reliance on individual income tax. As the global financial institutions have advised, a major challenge lies in diversifying the revenue base away from income tax. During the mining boom, company tax increased significantly, yet today, individual income tax makes up the majority of the tax revenue, with a disproportionate share of projected future increases. This imbalance means that promising tax cuts while insisting on maintaining budget surpluses could be overly optimistic and politically risky. Therefore, any discussion about tax cuts must carefully consider the economic and political implications, particularly how to sustainably manage public finances and reduce reliance on a single tax source.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Olivia Mead, a millionaire heiress whose list of expenses included a $1.2m crystal-encrusted grand piano and $2,000 annual upkeep of her pet axolotl, has had her inheritance cut from $25m to $6.14m following an appeal from her deceased father’s estate. The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father’s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have “any involvement or association whatsoever” with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than “traditional” Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead’s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court’s master, Craig Sanderson, said would “not fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community”. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright’s estate, acting on behalf of Wright’s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later. On Wednesday, the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court set aside Sanderson’s orders, ruling that while Sanderson was correct to say that Mead had been inadequately provided for in the original will: “The exercise of his discretion to order that provision be made for the respondent in the sum of $25m was flawed.” In a lengthy written judgment, the court found that Sanderson made a number of “material errors” in calculating the size of Mead’s inheritance, saying the focus should have been on what constituted “proper maintenance” and that the initial finding that Mead was “honest” and “not a gold-digger” were not relevant. “The capital sum should be sufficient to enable the respondent to purchase a reasonably substantial house with part of the capital sum and to invest the balance so that she will receive a reasonably substantial annuity for the remainder of her life,” the appeal court’s president, Michael Buss, said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n As the Queensland election campaign heads into its final stretch, Labor’s main message of “chaos” under a Liberal National party-One Nation government has been damaged by one of its own, while Adani continues to cause headaches for both major parties. With Queenslanders preparing to head to the polls on Saturday, no clear victor has emerged, leaving both the LNP and Labor scrambling to bed down seats. Labor has consolidated its message to one line – “a clear choice” – as it seeks to highlight what it says will be the “cuts and chaos” under a Tim Nicholls-led government. The LNP leader has said he is willing to work with One Nation in the event of a hung parliament. But the Labor campaign is reeling from the damage done by one of its own MPs, the former police minister Jo-Ann Miller, who sought out the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, in front of the media on Tuesday, embracing her and presenting her with a gift for her new grandson. Media at the event have reported that One Nation was aware of Miller’s intentions. Miller and Labor have maintained it was a coincidence of the campaign and a “common decency” to present a gift for a new baby. But the friendly meeting may have damaged Labor’s attempts to paint itself as standing apart from Hanson’s party, which is predicted to take seats across north and central Queensland, as well as some outer-urban electorates in the south-east. “The real issue here is what is going to happen in three days’ time, on Saturday,” Annastacia Palaszczuk said from Bundaberg on Wednesday, moments before her team attempted to keep her away from signs declaring: “It’ll be grim under Tim.” The placement of “grim” seemed a little too close for comfort for those focused on optics. “That is the real fundamental issue and it is about a choice, it is fundamentally about a clear choice,” she said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n As the Queensland election campaign heads into its final stretch, Labor’s main message of “chaos” under a Liberal National party-One Nation government has been damaged by one of its own, while Adani continues to cause headaches for both major parties. With Queenslanders preparing to head to the polls on Saturday, no clear victor has emerged, leaving both the LNP and Labor scrambling to bed down seats. Labor has consolidated its message to one line – “a clear choice” – as it seeks to highlight what it says will be the “cuts and chaos” under a Tim Nicholls-led government. The LNP leader has said he is willing to work with One Nation in the event of a hung parliament. But the Labor campaign is reeling from the damage done by one of its own MPs, the former police minister Jo-Ann Miller, who sought out the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, in front of the media on Tuesday, embracing her and presenting her with a gift for her new grandson. Media at the event have reported that One Nation was aware of Miller’s intentions. Miller and Labor have maintained it was a coincidence of the campaign and a “common decency” to present a gift for a new baby. But the friendly meeting may have damaged Labor’s attempts to paint itself as standing apart from Hanson’s party, which is predicted to take seats across north and central Queensland, as well as some outer-urban electorates in the south-east. “The real issue here is what is going to happen in three days’ time, on Saturday,” Annastacia Palaszczuk said from Bundaberg on Wednesday, moments before her team attempted to keep her away from signs declaring: “It’ll be grim under Tim.” The placement of “grim” seemed a little too close for comfort for those focused on optics. “That is the real fundamental issue and it is about a choice, it is fundamentally about a clear choice,” she said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Australia’s richest woman, mining magnate Gina Rinehart, has awarded Barnaby Joyce $40,000 for services to the agricultural sector. At a gala dinner in Canberra on Tuesday, Rinehart gave the inaugural agricultural and related industries award to Joyce, describing him as a “champion of the industry”. Labor immediately took aim at the award, with the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, labelling it a “$40,000 cash present”. Joyce has said he will refuse the cash. The Nationals leader, a close personal friend of Rinehart and former agriculture and water minister, is currently battling for his political life in the New England byelection after the high court ruled him ineligible to sit in parliament because of dual New Zealand citizenship. Rinehart thanked Joyce for taking “time out of your campaigning schedule to come here – to be here for the industry you love and support”. “What a great voice for Australian agriculture,” she said. “The agricultural industry is fortunate to have had such a dedicated, understanding and enthusiastic minister – one with years of first-hand experience – a real Aussie country boy and boy, do we hope you return.” Footage of the event shows Joyce stood up to accept the award and giant cheque, before modestly exclaiming “hooley dooley – rightio”. In addition to being the chair of Hancock Prospecting, Rinehart has extensive agricultural holdings and is the part owner of the $386m S Kidman and Co cattle company which has leasehold over 80,000 sq km in Australia’s north. At a press conference on Wednesday, Shorten asked: “Why is a mining millionaire giving a Turnbull government minister a $40,000 cash present?\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

This occurred at a gala where Rinehart announced Joyces as the agriculture and related industries recipient, emphasizing his dedication and support for the industry. Opponents criticized this gesture, likening it to a “crazy food present.” At Rinehart’s press conference, the opposition leader Bill Shorten opined on the absurdity of a mining mogul rewarding a government minister with substantial cash. Rinehart acknowledged Joyce's efforts and wished for him to return to the political arena. Joyce was involved with agricultural ventures, serving as a minister before facing disqualification due to dual citizenship.
