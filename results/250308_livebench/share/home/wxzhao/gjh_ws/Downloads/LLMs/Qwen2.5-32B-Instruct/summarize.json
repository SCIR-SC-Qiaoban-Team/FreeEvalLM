      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Half-submerged by a jungle and populated by cows, chickens and goats, it is one of the more unusual tourist attractions on the South Pacific island of Rarotonga: the “cursed” Sheraton hotel complex, a long-abandoned luxury resort that has lain derelict for a quarter of a century. The crumbling, graffiti-covered buildings are overgrown with creepers. The only human visitors to the 70-acre site in Vaimaanga pay a small fee to explore what has become known as the biggest white elephant in the South Pacific. The Italian-backed hotel project, which began in the late 1980s, was designed to revolutionise tourism in the remote Cook Islands by providing the tiny nation with its first five-star resort. But the house of cards collapsed at the 11th hour, with the project 80% complete, amid allegations of mafia involvement and money laundering back in Italy. The Cook Islands government was left with a debt of $120m and was almost bankrupted. In the years since, repeated attempts to finish the project have foundered, but now a new effort to salvage the buildings is under way, and could have an even bigger impact on the tiny Pacific state than the original plans were expected to. Tim Tepaki, a Cook Islander who has been involved in property development in New Zealand, claims to have hundreds of millions of dollars in Chinese backing. He hopes to rebuild the complex and turn the Pacific backwater into a favourite destination for tourists from China. Until now tourism in the Cooks – a nation of 15 islands scattered across an area the size of India – has relied mainly on visitors from Australia and New Zealand, who tend to focus on the capital Rarotonga and the atoll of Aitutaki, a 50-minute flight north.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The abandoned luxury resort, which has lain derelict for 25 years, is now a tourist attraction due to its haunting beauty.

The financial burden almost bankrupted the nation, which faced allegations of mafia involvement and money laundering back in Italy.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Pauline Hanson has likened the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, to a “spoilt brat” for ruling out a deal with One Nation. Arriving in Bundaberg just as the Labor campaign left, Hanson, who remains the most visible One Nation asset in Queensland, despite not running in Saturday’s state election, lashed out at Palaszczuk’s continued criticism of the party. Palaszczuk’s insistence that Labor would rather go into opposition than form government with One Nation has become its strongest attack line against the Liberal National party, which is directly preferencing One Nation in 50 of the 61 seats it is running in, as well as admitting, indirectly, it would form government with One Nation, if necessary. The opposition leader, Tim Nicholls, who has previously said he would work with the parliament Queenslanders delivered, was unable to answer “yes or no” to the question of whether he would form government with One Nation on Tuesday during a radio quiz, instead opting for “pass”. Hanson has responded with the line that the major parties are choosing not to respect the will of the people, in the same way Donald Trump’s campaign used Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment against the Democrat campaign last year. “I don’t think the premier knows what she is doing actually, I think she is in such a turmoil over this and she is actually needs to get out of the sandpit and be the leader for this state,” Hanson said. “Because the way she is carrying on, it is not leadership, it is not quality. “To say you won’t work with One Nation, it is just ridiculous. It’s like a spoilt brat, she is carrying on like a spoilt kid, and if that is what leadership means then I think she is heading down the wrong path and Tim Nicholls, he needs to grow up and make a decision, because people want clear decision in this state.

In a company memo, obtained by the Hollywood Reporter, Lasseter writes that he has fallen short in creating a culture that engenders “support and collaboration” and hints at behavior that he has been confronted about. “I’ve recently had a number of difficult conversations that have been very painful for me,” he writes. “It’s never easy to face your missteps, but it’s the only way to learn from them. As a result, I’ve been giving a lot of thought to the leader I am today compared to the mentor, advocate and champion I want to be. It’s been brought to my attention that I have made some of you feel disrespected or uncomfortable. That was never my intent.” Lasseter, who is one of the founders of Pixar and the director of Toy Story, also apologizes for letting employees down while adding more details about the conduct that has led to him taking a sabbatical. “I especially want to apologize to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form,” he writes. “No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.” In a statement, a Disney spokesperson responded: “We are committed to maintaining an environment in which all employees are respected and empowered to do their best work. We appreciate John’s candor and sincere apology and fully support his sabbatical.” The memo has arrived at the same time as an investigation by the Hollywood Reporter into complaints about Lasseter’s behavior.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Australia’s race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, says the high no vote in western Sydney in last week’s historic same-sex marriage postal survey reflects religious observance rather than ethnicity, and he has warned against an outbreak of crass, cultural stereotyping. Soutphommasane used a speech at the University of Western Sydney to issue a pointed warning against adopting “easy narratives” devoid of evidence about the behaviour or inclinations of particular ethnic groups in Australia. “In a world that many describe as post-truth or post-factual, our social cohesion is not always well served by jumping to conclusions,” he said. “Once-appealing narratives take hold, they can help fuel stereotypes about others – and these can be difficult to shake off. Sometimes this is because they may conveniently help to confirm cultural hierarchies in our society.” Soutphommasane said a narrative has sprung up since the postal survey which centres on ethnic minorities or multicultural communities being intrinsically hostile towards same-sex marriage, and to the LGBTI community at large. He said while some ethnic communities hold to the view that marriage is between a man and a woman, that view is shaped often by religious or cultural traditions. The race commissioner said a more clear-eyed examination of the postal survey data suggests religiosity, or religious observance, was a more significant factor for no voters – a fact well understood by the no campaign, which targeted messages to a range of communities in Sydney’s west. Soutphommasane said if you look at the voting trends outside western Sydney, a more mixed picture emerges – a picture where seats with populations of more than 40% born overseas overwhelmingly voted yes. He pointed out that the most multicultural electorates in New South Wales and Victoria recorded high yes votes – seats like Sydney, Grayndler, Kingsford Smith, Bradfield, Batman, Wills, Gellibrand and Chisholm. “To suggest that an overwhelming majority of multicultural communities voted no – and did so out of some essential cultural hostility against gays and lesbians – is to entertain something that comes close to an unkind stereotype,” the race commissioner said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Australia’s race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, says the high no vote in western Sydney in last week’s historic same-sex marriage postal survey reflects religious observance rather than ethnicity, and he has warned against an outbreak of crass, cultural stereotyping. Soutphommasane used a speech at the University of Western Sydney to issue a pointed warning against adopting “easy narratives” devoid of evidence about the behaviour or inclinations of particular ethnic groups in Australia. “In a world that many describe as post-truth or post-factual, our social cohesion is not always well served by jumping to conclusions,” he said. “Once-appealing narratives take hold, they can help fuel stereotypes about others – and these can be difficult to shake off. Sometimes this is because they may conveniently help to confirm cultural hierarchies in our society.” Soutphommasane said a narrative has sprung up since the postal survey which centres on ethnic minorities or multicultural communities being intrinsically hostile towards same-sex marriage, and to the LGBTI community at large. He said while some ethnic communities hold to the view that marriage is between a man and a woman, that view is shaped often by religious or cultural traditions. The race commissioner said a more clear-eyed examination of the postal survey data suggests religiosity, or religious observance, was a more significant factor for no voters – a fact well understood by the no campaign, which targeted messages to a range of communities in Sydney’s west. Soutphommasane said if you look at the voting trends outside western Sydney, a more mixed picture emerges – a picture where seats with populations of more than 40% born overseas overwhelmingly voted yes. He pointed out that the most multicultural electorates in New South Wales and Victoria recorded high yes votes – seats like Sydney, Grayndler, Kingsford Smith, Bradfield, Batman, Wills, Gellibrand and Chisholm. “To suggest that an overwhelming majority of multicultural communities voted no – and did so out of some essential cultural hostility against gays and lesbians – is to entertain something that comes close to an unkind stereotype,” the race commissioner said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Thousands of miles away in Beijing – for years Mugabe’s most powerful backer – there were no obvious signs of jubilation. “China respects Mr Mugabe’s decision to resign,” foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters, praising his “historic contribution” to Zimbabwe’s liberation. “He remains a good friend of the Chinese people.” But experts believe China’s leaders will be both relieved and contented to see the back of “Comrade Bob” – a suspicion reinforced by the approving tone coverage of his demise has taken in the Communist party-controlled press. “We need change in our country,” China’s official news agency Xinhua – whose correspondents’ dispatches are expected, above all else, to reflect the party line – quoted one Zimbabwean teacher as saying of Mugabe’s resignation. “We’re very happy,” another Zimbabwean told party mouthpiece the People’s Daily. “Finally things will change.” Ross Anthony, an expert in China-Africa relations from South Africa’s Stellenbosch University, said that while Beijing had backed Mugabe since his days as a Marxist revolutionary in the 1970s, it had increasingly seen him as erratic, an embarrassment and a threat to Chinese investments. A case in point was Mugabe’s controversial indigenisation law, which required all foreign companies to be controlled by Zimbabweans and was a particular blow to Chinese interests in its diamond industry. “I imagine there are quite a lot of officials in Beijing who will be happy to see Mugabe go,” Anthony said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

But then just when you’ve done the hardest bit, just when you’ve got them over the line despite all the public challenges and personal sacrifices along the way, you chuck it all in. This isn’t the way these things normally happen. Coaches resign all the time, of course, but usually only when they notice the axe glinting above their heads. One suspects we’ve a lot to learn yet abut the dynamic between Postecoglou and his employers at FFA but there’s no suggestion at this time that Postecoglou’s position was in jeopardy.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Patients are being put at risk because doctors are giving them drugs they do not need and sending them for unnecessary surgery to avoid a complaint being made against them, research has revealed. Medics are so scared of being complained about that they are also giving patients more tests than their symptoms merit and not performing procedures that involve more risk than usual. Four out of five doctors who become the subject of a complaint find the experience so stressful that they start practising more “defensive medicine” than before, according to a survey of 6,144 doctors in Britain about whom a patient, relative or colleague had complained. “This involved ‘hedging’, which includes performing more tests than necessary, over-referral and overprescribing as well as ‘avoidance’, which includes avoiding procedures, not accepting high-risk patients or abandoning procedures early,” according to research by a team led by Prof Tom Bourne of Imperial College London, whose findings have been published in the journal BMJ Open. “These behaviours may have a serious impact on patient care,” they warned. While litigation, complaints and investigations are intended to protect patients from poor care and medical negligence, the “burden and stress associated with these processes are clearly having unintended consequences and it may be argued that when examined as a whole, these structures may be causing more harm to patient care than good,” the study said. “While the regulatory system may protect patients from the misconduct of a relatively small number of doctors, it has a perverse effect on the majority of doctors who become preoccupied by defensive practice,” it added. Doctors who resort to “fear-driven working practices that could compromise patient care” also waste vital resources and their conduct “creates significant costs for the NHS”, the co-authors added. Bourne could not quantify how much NHS spending goes on that, but pointed to a study that found such practices accounted for 10% of Italy’s health budget. The General Medical Council, which regulates Britain’s 250,000 doctors, receives 9,000-10,000 complaints a year.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Nick Xenophon Team senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore will resign from the Senate because she has dual British citizenship by descent through her mother. At a press conference in Adelaide on Wednesday, Kakoschke-Moore announced she had received advice from the UK Home Office on Friday, confirmed by a specialist barrister, that she had received British citizenship from her mother, who was born in Singapore in 1957. Kakoschke-Moore had always believed she was not British because her father had received advice from the British embassy in Oman she was not eligible for citizenship when she was 12. She said she was “heartbroken” to discover she was British, which she described as “extremely surprising” because she “had no reason to believe I was a British citizen until that point”. Kakoschke-Moore explained that her mother was born in Singapore, a former British colony, which gave her “citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies” and became a British citizen in 1983 when the British Nationality Act came into effect. Kakoschke-Moore, born in Darwin in 1985, then gained that citizenship by descent. Kakoschke-Moore said she would request the matter be referred to the high court to determine how the vacancy would be filled, adding she would “continue to run” for the NXT and “at this stage” her ambition was to come back to the Senate. A recount of the 2016 Senate election would likely elect the NXT candidate Tim Storrer, who unsuccessfully attempted to replace Xenophon in the Senate by challenging the party’s chosen successor. Xenophon said he and his colleagues were “devastated” by the loss of Kakoschke-Moore from the Senate, but predicted it was “not the end of her political career”. Xenophon said the party had preliminary legal advice the position may not be filled by a recount, claiming the situation was “uncharted legal territory” because of the high court’s recent decision involving Hollie Hughes.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Xenophon said he and his colleagues were “devastated” by the loss of Kakoschke-Moore from the Senate, but predicted it was “not the end of her political career”. Xenophon said the party had preliminary legal advice the position may not be filled by a recount, claiming the situation was “uncharted legal territory” because of the high court’s recent decision involving Hollie Hughes.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Two Manusian men – Catholic priest Father Clement Taulam and retired army major Michael Kuweh – are defying the PNG and Australian governments in calling for assistance for the refugees and asylum seekers on Manus, and for a peaceable solution to the standoff inside the condemned Australian-run detention centre. Speaking at his Papitalai parish church on Los Negros Island, across a small bay from the detention centre, Taulam said the enforced shutdown of the centre – in which 380 men remain – had left people vulnerable and suffering. Over years of pastoral care, he has built up friendships with many of those in the centre, he told the Guardian and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. “Now when they say they have no food, no water, no lights, they are deprived physically but they are saying too, that the physical is also spiritual for them. They are deprived of faith. They are suffering.” Taulam said no government seemed willing to take care of the men who remain in the centre. “Australia seems to be saying, ‘Papua New Guinea, this is your responsibility’. And Papua New Guinea is saying to Australia, ‘Do your work, clean up your mess.’ And while this is going on, these people are suffering.” “I’ve been talking with them, going to see them.

    "response":"<|begin_of_thought|>\nThe provided text for analysis contains opening sentences of a news article from The Guardian, focusing on the situation of refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea. The primary issue discussed is the turmoil within the Australian-run detention center and the role two Manusian men are taking in calling for assistance. The text gives details about the conditions inside the detention center from the perspective of Father Clement Taulam, a local Catholic priest with years of pastoral care involvement with the refugees. It also sheds light on the diplomatic deadlock between the Australian and Papua New Guinea governments regarding the responsibility for these refugees.\nAnalyzing the sentences, the crux of the concern revolves around the plight of the 380 refugees who are experiencing a dire situation due to the center's closure, as neither Australia nor Papua New Guinea is stepping up to take care of them. The article captures their basic needs being unmet and their spiritual suffering.\nFather Clement Taulam and retired army major Michael Kuweh are identified as two local leaders taking a stand against the government's approach, advocating for the refugees' needs. It clarifies they wish for attention and assistance to the affected individuals and a search for peaceful resolution.\nThe article exposes a diplomatic stalemate, in which both Australia and Papua New Guinea are deflecting responsibility. The refugees are depicted as willing to migrate to Australia but face rejection and being placed in processing to other nations instead.\nGiven this understanding, the task does not explicitly ask for a direct answer from the three options but rather for a summative response based on the provided sentences.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The former Liberal minister Philip Ruddock has been appointed to examine if Australian law adequately protects the human right to religious freedom. Ruddock’s appointment by cabinet, announced on Wednesday, is designed to head off a bruising debate about religious amendments in a same-sex marriage bill, but the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the review was “no substitute” for those amendments. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said it was important to look at the issue of religious freedom carefully, in light of the yes vote and impending legislation on marriage equality. While senior conservatives including Peter Dutton and Mathias Cormann have publicly suggested a religious freedom bill can be considered next year, separately to a marriage bill, others including Morrison and Liberal senator, David Fawcett, have insisted it be considered at the same time. Ruddock has been asked to report by 31 March. Turnbull said a variety of proposals for legislative changes to protect freedom of religion have been put forward in recent months but many of them go beyond the immediate issue of marriage, and parliament needed to be wary of them. “Any reforms to protect religious freedom at large should be undertaken carefully,” he said in a statement on Wednesday. “There is a high risk of unintended consequences when parliament attempts to legislate protections for basic rights and freedoms, such as freedom of religion. The government is particularly concerned to prevent uncertainties caused by generally worded bill of rights-style declarations. “This will be a timely expert stocktake to inform consideration of any necessary legislative reforms.” Turnbull said Ruddock was the right person to conduct the review because he had served as Australia’s special envoy for human rights.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Last weekend Faced with a quiet moment, Donald Trump tends to stir up a spat with a sports star or a celebrity, seemingly in order to open new fronts in America’s “culture wars” and reassure his base about which side he’s on. When it comes to sports, Trump’s targets are often African American, and he pursued a few such targets this week. Regular readers may remember that when last week the president asked China to free three UCLA basketball players accused of shoplifting, his main concern was that the players would thank him, which they did. But when LaVar Ball, the father of one of the arrested players and an inveterate attention seeker himself, questioned just how critical a role Trump actually played, it enraged the president. “I should have left them in jail!” he tweeted on Sunday, adding six hours later that he “should have gotten his son [LiAngelo Ball] out during my next trip to China instead … Very ungrateful!” Trump – whose sons Donald Jr and Eric are well-known hunters – also gave more clues about his perhaps surprisingly critical views on the US Fish and Wildlife Service plan to allow imports of elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia, tweeting: “Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal.” Monday Returning to his racially tinged offensive, Trump singled out Marshawn Lynch of the Oakland Raiders for sitting down during the playing of The Star-Spangled Banner. “Great disrespect!” tweeted the president, adding another dog whistle for the base when he pointed out that Lynch had stood up “for the Mexican anthem”. Black athletes have been protesting during the national anthem since the summer, to highlight police violence and racial injustice. Tuesday Sexual misconduct accusations against the Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore are a less divisive issue, at least outside Alabama – Moore has been condemned widely, including by numerous GOP figures. But after some prevaricating Trump came down on the candidate’s side. Asked the memorable question “Is Roy Moore, [allegedly] a child molester, better than a Democrat?”, Trump pointed out that Moore denied the claims against him, one of which involves a woman who was 14 at the time, and said: “I can tell you one thing for sure: we don’t need a liberal person in there, a Democrat.” Trump has himself been accused by numerous women of sexual harassment.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The previous round of talks in May failed to reach an agreement. The goalkeeper, who spent three successful years on loan at Atlético Madrid after joining Chelsea from Genk, has been an integral part of the team who have won two Premier League titles in the past three seasons. His agent, Christophe Henrotay, held talks with the champions towards the end of last season, seeking to take the Belgian’s wages closer to the £200,000 a week level enjoyed by Eden Hazard at Stamford Bridge and another of the division’s elite goalkeepers, David de Gea, at Manchester United. Although Courtois – who kept 16 clean sheets in the league last season – is happy at Chelsea and willing to sign improved terms, he has regularly expressed his fondness for life in La Liga, where his situation continues to be monitored by a number of clubs, notably Real Madrid. His former girlfriend has returned to Spain with the couple’s two children. Chelsea are well aware of interest in him from Spanish clubs and will be anxious to achieve a positive resolution before the player goes into the final year of his deal, potentially damaging his value and their bargaining position. “The most important thing is to perform well for myself and the team,” said Courtois before the Champions League game against Qarabag. “Regarding my contract, that’s something where Chelsea must deal with my agent.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Unity Spencer, who has died aged 87, was perhaps best known for being the daughter of the artist Stanley Spencer, but she was also a talented painter in her own right, a skilful realist with a powerful imaginative vision. Two of her best and most memorable works, which reveal her father’s influence, are a striking self-portrait from 1954, and a 1957 portrait of Stanley himself. She had three solo shows of her paintings in London, and contributed to many mixed exhibitions, from the London Group to the Royal Academy shows. The first of her one-person shows was at Lauderdale House in Highgate, in 1993, the second at the Boundary Gallery in St John’s Wood in 2001, both in north London, but it was the third that really established her reputation. In 2015, the Fine Art Society in Bond Street mounted the first West End exhibition of her work, to coincide with the publication of her autobiography, Lucky to Be an Artist. Fifty of her paintings from all periods were shown along with her etchings, accompanied by a group of pictures by her family: works by her parents, her uncles Gilbert Spencer and Richard Carline, and by her grandfather George Carline. This show came at the suggestion of a friend, the painter David Inshaw. He recalled visiting her house in Clapham (where, according to her son, she had inscribed “Daring, Joy and Love” on her bedroom wall), expecting to find it hung with paintings by herself and her parents. But the walls were oddly bare, with not even her own work in sight. The public has always been more interested in the Spencer\/Carline family’s eccentric lifestyle than in the art produced and Unity spent a substantial part of her life explaining if not defending her parents.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The furniture maker, which employs 547 people in 50 shops and manufactures upholstered furnishings in Thetford, Norfolk, has struggled amid a tough retail market in which shoppers are shying away from spending on expensive items for their homes. Multiyork had reportedly been put on the market by its major shareholder, the furnishings tycoon Charles Wade of Wade Furniture Group, which also owns beds maker Feather &amp; Black. The two brands are run as separate entities and the administration does not include the bed maker. Administrators said that Multiyork has fallen into financial difficulties as it could not meet its financial liabilities as a result of trading losses. The company had net debt of £1.9m at its 2016 year end, according to the latest accounts filed at Companies House. It recorded a profit of just £479,000 in the 53 weeks to 2 October 2016 after a £714,000 loss a year before. The company increased sales by 5.4% to £50.4m, partly thanks to an extra week’s trading on the year before. The brand, which was founded in 1978 and initially operated in the Old Mill site in the village of Mellis, Suffolk, was rescued from receivership by Wade in 1995.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n How sad to read how far behind we are in teaching children computing skills (We’re sending analogue children into a digital future, 20 November). In the late 1970s I was one of the first computer studies teachers. Our secondary school started with one microcomputer and 90 pupils taking computer studies as an option subject. The computer was booked solidly from early morning to night-time so pupils could access the exciting new technology for their coursework, which was 100% programming. Pupils of all abilities were totally engaged with the practical side of the course and derived huge satisfaction from even the simplest of programs. It was also unique in providing an outlet for the brightest pupils to stretch themselves, with future Oxbridge students working at projects way beyond the understanding of their teachers. Then, as the years passed by, came the educational “experts” who decided that learning IT skills (how to use PowerPoint, Word, Excel etc) was the way forward and computer studies courses became a thing of the past. Without a doubt, had computing courses expanded in line with the development of the technology, Britain could have been leading the world, not sitting marvelling at what children in other countries can produce. Bob Epton Brigg, Lincolnshire • John Harris addresses an important issue: of course school computer education ought always to have been about much more than PowerPoint. Forty years ago I was lecturing to civil servants at the now-defunct Civil Service College (abolished by the Tories in 1995) on ICT and systems.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n How sad to read how far behind we are in teaching children computing skills (We’re sending analogue children into a digital future, 20 November). In the late 1970s I was one of the first computer studies teachers. Our secondary school started with one microcomputer and 90 pupils taking computer studies as an option subject. The computer was booked solidly from early morning to night-time so pupils could access the exciting new technology for their coursework, which was 100% programming. Pupils of all abilities were totally engaged with the practical side of the course and derived huge satisfaction from even the simplest of programs. It was also unique in providing an outlet for the brightest pupils to stretch themselves, with future Oxbridge students working at projects way beyond the understanding of their teachers. Then, as the years passed by, came the educational “experts” who decided that learning IT skills (how to use PowerPoint, Word, Excel etc) was the way forward and computer studies courses became a thing of the past. Without a doubt, had computing courses expanded in line with the development of the technology, Britain could have been leading the world, not sitting marvelling at what children in other countries can produce. Bob Epton Brigg, Lincolnshire • John Harris addresses an important issue: of course school computer education ought always to have been about much more than PowerPoint. Forty years ago I was lecturing to civil servants at the now-defunct Civil Service College (abolished by the Tories in 1995) on ICT and systems.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The early days of the 1970s offered a proactive approach to teaching computing, where subjects like programming were the main focus. This was met with much enthusiasm from students. However, over the years, educational \"experts\" changed this approach to prioritize learning more general IT skills like using PowerPoint or Word, leading to less emphasis on genuine computing skills.\n\nSecond paragraph:\nNext, I will discuss the consequences of the shift in educational focus.

The chancellor unveiled plans, including a new duty band on still cider and perry with an alcohol content between 6.9% and 7.5%, in a move the Treasury said was aimed at “white cider”. White cider is often cited as a particular problem for alcoholics and homeless people because it is cheap but strong. But traditional cider makers, some with decades of history in the craft, warned that they would be caught up in legislation that might not even have the desired effect. Arfur Daley, of the family-run Gwatkin Cider, in Herefordshire, said: “It won’t affect the larger cider makers. But the more artisanal cider makers it will affect. I’d like to see an exception if you’re using whole fruit. Larger cider makers use concentrate, but everything we make is from the apples.” Neil Worley, managing director of Worley’s Cider, in Somerset, said that while small producers could suffer, white cider firms could still sell cheap high-strength drink. “They will just reformulate to 6.9%,” he said. “At £3.50 a bottle the price would be 15.5p a unit and at 6.9% it’s 16.9p per unit, so the difference is negligible.” But the plans also drew criticism from larger white cider firms, such as Aston Manor Cider, whose 7.5% Frosty Jack’s brand costs £3.59 for a three-litre bottle in the shop Iceland.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"<|begin_of_thought|>\n The task is to summarize a news article with a specific set of keywords included. I'll need to extract the main themes, facts, and perspectives presented in the text.\n\\n\\nFirstly, analyzing the text, the article talks about a tax plan on cider with a certain alcohol content. It seems the 'background' of this policy is to target 'white cider' for being a cheap but strong drink associated with alcoholism and homelessness. However, only a small percentage of the cider market would be affected.\n\\n\\nThe second paragraph should begin with 'bother'. The key 'battle' here is between traditional cider makers, who are protesting over this policy, and the government. The cider-makers argue the proposed tax would impact their businesses harshly while 'larger cider makers' will not be significantly affected, and 'white cider' might just reformulate its products to remain untaxed and cheap.\n\\n\\nThe 'look' is contextual as the article doesn't explicitly give a look into the policy or a perspective but suggests that considering the context, the policy was designed to target the 'wall' of cheaper and stronger alcohols that mainly end up with alcoholics and homeless people. The other key phrase 'purchase' might not be directly related to the content itself but can be loosely associated with the effect such a tax policy will have on the 'purchase' patterns of cheaper cider by the traditionally underprivileged people.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\\n\\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nThe 'background' of this policy involves the government's attempt to introduce a tax on super-strength cider, particularly targeting 'white cider' which is commonly associated with alcoholism and homelessness due to its low price and high strength. However, this plan has faced opposition from many traditional cider makers who argue that this policy will disproportionately affect smaller, artisanal producers while not making a significant impact on larger cider makers.\n\\n\\nThe 'battle' between the government and traditional cider makers is evident, as the latter argues that the proposed tax will impact the 'purchase' habits of consumers, pushing them towards cheaper alternatives rather than tackling the issue of white cider. Moreover, the cider-makers assert that the proposed tax will also harm their businesses and do little to discourage the consumption of high-strength cider, as manufacturers of 'white cider' can simply reformulate their products to avoid the tax.\n\\n\\nThe policy, nevertheless, faces criticism even from the 'wall' it attempts to tackle — the producers of white cider, as they refute the effectiveness of such a measure. Despite the announced plans, it is uncertain if the objectives will be met, and the broader implications for the cider industry and public health remain to be seen. Thus, a 'look' into the future suggests a careful balance between public health and the survival of smaller, traditional cider-makers may be required in future policy-making. \n<|end_of_solution|>",

We usually take a measured approach to parking but with an incident like this we want to know what is going on before looking for a parking space that could see us backtracking 200-300 metres.

A colleague tweeted a picture of it that went viral. We noticed it after arriving at hospital with a patient in a critical condition. It had been our first job of the day and when we had pulled up outside the property, people were waiting outside to meet us. I could tell from the expression of one man that he was very concerned. We weren’t going to be at the scene for long. The patient was vomiting blood. I told my colleague to get a stretcher. We usually take a measured approach to parking but with an incident like this we want to know what is going on before looking for a parking space that could see us backtracking 200-300 metres.

    "response":"<<Rising Costs and Financial Obligations in UK Care Homes>>\n\nThe Guardian article highlights the often overlooked financial pressures faced by self-funding individuals in UK care homes, revealing inaccuracies in media portrayals. It clarifies that local authorities do not take full responsibility when an individual's assets fall to £23,250, instead continuing to charge £1 for each £250 in assets until the limit of £14,250 is reached. Even when personal contributions cease, families are still required to pay top-up fees, while councils reclaim all types of pension, state or private.\n\n***\n\nA poignant example of the escalating costs is given through the author's mother, requiring over £250,000 in expenses for over four years of nursing home care, including the sale of her flat and depletion of her savings. The rise in care home costs is primarily attributed to the privatization of care homes, which allows providers to charge self-funders high prices due to significant demand.\n\n***\n\nThe article goes on to describe the financial impact on individuals' resources, which dwindles rapidly under the strain of high care costs, eventually necessitating local authority intervention. The privatization of care homes has also led to significant investment opportunities for international investors, with newspaper advertisements promoting UK care homes as a lucrative investment due to the guaranteed 8% return on investment.\n\n***\n\nIn conclusion, the article emphasizes the pressing need for greater transparency and accurate reporting on the financial struggles faced by individuals in UK care homes, while also underlining the broader issue of privatization and its effects on care home economics. It serves as a call for addressing these underlying problems to attain a more equitable system for those in need of long-term care.",

Why? Why?” I look at my favourite boxer, who used to be rated as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world, and prepare to tell him the obvious reason. But, pausing first, I remember the compelling stir Toney created in the early 1990s. Before then, when he was still carrying a gun and selling crack on the outskirts of Detroit, Toney’s life seemed distorted by his violent past. His father had repeatedly beaten his mother, Sherry, at gunpoint. When James was only one, his dad shot Sherry and left them for dead. But Sherry is an incredible woman and, even though James was troubled, she channelled his incoherent rage. She brought him to a boxing gym so that, if he wanted to fight everyone, at least he could learn how to do it properly.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n “Why?” James Toney says fiercely as, just a foot away, the once brilliant and intimidating boxer leans forward and stares at me. “You wanted me to stop fighting? Why? Why?” I look at my favourite boxer, who used to be rated as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world, and prepare to tell him the obvious reason. But, pausing first, I remember the compelling stir Toney created in the early 1990s. Before then, when he was still carrying a gun and selling crack on the outskirts of Detroit, Toney’s life seemed distorted by his violent past. His father had repeatedly beaten his mother, Sherry, at gunpoint. When James was only one, his dad shot Sherry and left them for dead. But Sherry is an incredible woman and, even though James was troubled, she channelled his incoherent rage. She brought him to a boxing gym so that, if he wanted to fight everyone, at least he could learn how to do it properly.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"<<The Boxing Chapter: A Turning Point from Disaster>>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\nFirst, I'll analyze the passage to identify the main elements and themes: James Toney, his past, boxing, and his mother Sherry's role in his journey.\n\nJames Toney's story is a compelling one, with a past filled with violence and drug sales. His life took a turn when he started boxing and found a proper way to channel his rage. I note that the text doesn't directly mention keywords ['chapter', 'disaster', 'floor', 'result', 'trash'], which makes integrating them a creative challenge.\n\nSummarizing the story effectively requires a narrative approach to highlight Toney's transformation and his mother Sherry's significant contribution while interweaving the provided keywords in a coherent manner.\n\nTo integrate the keywords in a reasonable way, I'll now brainstorm the possible context: 'chapter' could represent a turning point, 'disaster' refers to his dark past, 'floor' may relate to boxing, 'result' may point to his boxing career's success, and 'trash' can be associated with his past life as a drug dealer, for instance.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nIn this boxing chapter, James Toney's life once was a disaster teetering on the edge of the trash heap, where he sold crack and carried a gun. His tumultuous past, from a violent upbringing in the outskirts of Detroit to almost dying at his father's hand, appears to have no redeeming hope. Sherry, his remarkable mother, changed his life's course by propelling him to the floor of boxing rings. On that 'floor', he poured his rage into an artform and found a constructive outlet for his incoherent passion. This decision led to a successful boxing career and shifted the trajectory of his life from being a mere box of 'trash' to achieving greatness. The result of Sherry's lessons and Toney's boxing spirit kept him on the 'floor' for hours on end, each blow and punch, a stepping stone moving from the 'disaster' and pistil of his youth to becoming the world's best boxer pound-for-pound.\n<|end_of_solution|>",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n At this stage in her career, no one expects Björk’s latest record to sound much like her last one. And yet it’s hard to avoid heaving a thankful sigh when Arisen My Senses, the opening track of her ninth studio album, Utopia, crashes into life: birdsong giving way to bright splashes of electronics, beatific-sounding harp chords and cascading beats not unlike the oft-sampled rhythm track of Schoolly D’s old rap classic PSK, What Does It Mean? It sounds positively ecstatic, which comes as a relief. Utopia’s predecessor, 2015’s Vulnicura, was a remarkable record, a latterday entry into the canon of legendary break-up albums. It attained its place alongside Marvin Gaye’s Here, My Dear and Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks by setting its fathomless misery to atonal string arrangements and abstract electronics that, during its central track, kept vanishing into a single flatlining beep. It was raw, brave, challenging, unique and all the other adjectives heaped on it in reviews, but with the best will in the world, any album so harrowing that the appearance of gloom-laden vocalist Anohni constitutes a moment of light relief is going to be one that defies you to listen to it repeatedly. Utopia reanimates Vulnicura’s collaboration with Venezuela-born electronic auteur Arca, but is made of lighter material. Aside from his endlessly shifting soundscapes, distorted beats and penchant for sonic tapestries made from manipulated vocal samples, the album’s primary sound is woodwind, provided by an assembly of 12 female flautists from Reykjavik, which automatically lends it a far airier quality than the claustrophobic Vulnicura. It is, Björk says, her “Tinder album”, and its advance billing as a kind of Songs for Swinging Bachelorettes is borne out by its lyrics, which are obsessed both with technology and the vicissitudes of budding romance. “Is this excess texting blessing?” ponders Blissing Me, the saga of “two music nerds … sending each other MP3s”, before reverting to grief: “our physical union a fantasy, I just fell in love with a song”.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

It is, Björk says, her “Tinder album”, and its advance billing as a kind of Songs for Swinging Bachelorettes is borne out by its lyrics, which are obsessed both with technology and the vicissitudes of budding romance. “Is this excess texting blessing?” ponders Blissing Me, the saga of “two music nerds … sending each other MP3s”, before reverting to grief: “our physical union a fantasy, I just fell in love with a song”.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"<|begin_of_thought|>\nAnalyzing the given text, I see that it's about journalist's description of Björk's new album, Utopia, in comparison to her previous album, Vulnicura. The journalist highlights the differences in sound, style, and themes of the albums. Given that the first paragraph needs to start with 'injury', I need to find something from the text that might align with this word or find an appropriate connection. Vulnicura seems to be about a breakup, which could be metaphorically described as an 'injury' to the soul.\n\nSummarizing findings,\n1. Vulnicura is a breakup album with a darker sound and more sorrowful theme.\n2. Utopia has a lighter sound and more hopefulness in love.\n\nIn step 3, I consider how to connect the idea of an 'injury' to the content of the article. Given that Vulnicura was an album dealing with a breakup and hurt, this represents an injury to her artistically and personally. I will expand on this metaphorically to begin the summary.\n\nStep 4 and 5 involve constructing the summary paragraphs, starting the first one with the word 'Injury'. This includes summarizing the information about both albums, comparing and contrasting them, and providing specific examples from the text. Finally, I will ensure the required formatting is followed - paragraphs separated with '\\n\\n'.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nInjury is a fitting term to describe the emotional state Björk was in while creating her 2015 album, Vulnicura, which dissected the pain of a breakup, its harrowing intensity making it difficult for listeners to repeatedly enjoy. While reported to be a remarkable record, emotional strains from the break-up album demand renewed vigor and freshness from her subsequent works, thus easing up some emotional exhaustion for listeners and the artist alike.\n\\n\\n\nThe coming of her new album, Utopia, signaling a shift away from the claustrophobic tunes of Vulnicura, blends a mix of feminized woodwind and electronic auteur Arca’s soundscapes, allowing for a smoother, lighter, and more lively aural experience compared to her previous sad tunes. Its heightened excitement is initiated by Arisen My Senses, a track that marries birdsongs, electronics, harp chords, and beats, painting an image of its ecstasies.\n\\n\\n\nInterestingly, described as her \"Tinder album\", Utopia dials down on the dismal narratives of Vulnicura and hones into fray of technology and budding romance, where it champions the story of two music nerds exchanging MP3s and finding a song-like love. It presents a bachelorette-like aura of warmth and optimism, a stark contrast to the sorrow of Vulnicura. <|end_of_solution|>",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Conservative MPs have countered Jeremy Corbyn’s swingeing criticism of the budget as the work of “a government no longer fit for office” with a broad endorsement of Philip Hammond, in sharp contrast to their open reservations about the chancellor’s plans last year. Hammond’s colleagues used the first of four days of scheduled debate about the budget to praise not just his high-profile announcements on housing, but also his commitment of £3bn to prepare for any Brexit eventuality. In his response to the budget, Corbyn – it is the leader of the opposition who traditionally speaks rather than the shadow chancellor – said Hammond had completely failed to tackle a national crisis of stagnation and falling wages. “The test of a budget is how it affects the reality of people’s lives all around this country,” the Labour leader said. “And I believe as the days go ahead, and this budget unravels, the reality will be – a lot of people will be no better off. And the misery that many are in will be continuing.” Largely eschewing direct focus on Hammond’s specific announcements in favour of a broader critique of the government’s wider economic approach, Corbyn castigated Hammond for again missing deficit reduction targets, and for a continued spending squeeze on schools and the police. Speaking about housing, Corbyn said rough sleeping had doubled since 2010, and that this Christmas 120,000 children would be living in temporary accommodation. “We need a large-scale publicly funded housebuilding programme, not this government’s accounting tricks and empty promises.”Summing up, he said: “We were promised a revolutionary budget.

    "response":"<<Summary of Missing Argentinian Submarine Search Efforts>>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nFirst, I will identify the core elements of the news report to summarize:\n- The news is about a missing Argentinian submarine, ARA San Juan.\n- Ships and planes searching for the missing submarine will return to a previously searched area.\n- The reason for this is due to the detection of a \"hydro-acoustic anomaly\" by the US and specialist agencies.\n- This anomaly occurred just a few hours after the sub's last contact on November 15th.\n- There is little hope for the crew's survival as the oxygen reserves reached their limit on Wednesday morning.\n- Family members of the crew are angry with the delay in search efforts.\n- Search efforts were delayed by 48 hours due to Navy protocol.\n- Family members are worried and frustrated about the delay in search efforts.\n\nTo summarize, I will need to highlight these findings and consider the emotional and logistical states of the situation.\n- Highlighting that the core of the situation is the renewed search effort for the missing submarine.\n- Emphasizing the cause for this is the detection of the hydro-acoustic anomaly.\n- Mentioning the dwindling hope of rescue due to the oxygen supply reach its limit.\n- Noticing the frustration expressed by the family members at the delay in search efforts.\n- Including the Navy's protocol as a reason for the delay, even if controversial.\n\nI will integrate these elements into a concise summary maintaining the gist of the original report.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nThe Argentinian Navy has announced that ships and planes searching for the missing ARA San Juan submarine will return to a previously searched area after a \"hydro-acoustic anomaly\" was detected near its last known position. With seven days elapsed since the submarine's last contact, the crew's chances of survival are slim, as oxygen reserves have likely run out by now.

    "filtered_answer":"<<Summary of Missing Argentinian Submarine Search Efforts>>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nFirst, I will identify the core elements of the news report to summarize:\n- The news is about a missing Argentinian submarine, ARA San Juan.\n- Ships and planes searching for the missing submarine will return to a previously searched area.\n- The reason for this is due to the detection of a \"hydro-acoustic anomaly\" by the US and specialist agencies.\n- This anomaly occurred just a few hours after the sub's last contact on November 15th.\n- There is little hope for the crew's survival as the oxygen reserves reached their limit on Wednesday morning.\n- Family members of the crew are angry with the delay in search efforts.\n- Search efforts were delayed by 48 hours due to Navy protocol.\n- Family members are worried and frustrated about the delay in search efforts.\n\nTo summarize, I will need to highlight these findings and consider the emotional and logistical states of the situation.\n- Highlighting that the core of the situation is the renewed search effort for the missing submarine.\n- Emphasizing the cause for this is the detection of the hydro-acoustic anomaly.\n- Mentioning the dwindling hope of rescue due to the oxygen supply reach its limit.\n- Noticing the frustration expressed by the family members at the delay in search efforts.\n- Including the Navy's protocol as a reason for the delay, even if controversial.\n\nI will integrate these elements into a concise summary maintaining the gist of the original report.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nThe Argentinian Navy has announced that ships and planes searching for the missing ARA San Juan submarine will return to a previously searched area after a \"hydro-acoustic anomaly\" was detected near its last known position. With seven days elapsed since the submarine's last contact, the crew's chances of survival are slim, as oxygen reserves have likely run out by now. Family members of the missing crew are increasingly frustrated by the rescue efforts' delayed start, which was a delayed 48 hours due to military protocol, causing them a heightened sense of worry.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n England are pencilled in to play Ireland in Dublin next autumn under the auspices of a new Six Nations tournament to increase the strength of northern hemisphere rugby league. The tournament is provisionally on the Rugby League International Federation’s calendar and would comprise the same participants as rugby union’s Six Nations in 2018. Of those six, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France and Italy were eliminated in the group stages of the current Rugby League World Cup, while England face Tonga in a semi-final on Saturday. Richard Egan, the chairman of Rugby League Ireland, told the Guardian: “The provisional RLIF fixtures at the minute show that there is a Six Nations next year. It’s unconfirmed at the minute, though, and that’s where I have issues in developing the sport here. “In other sports you can buy tickets years in advance but I can’t guarantee what fixtures I’ve got to sell next year.” It is unclear when the RLIF plan to announce the details officially, though the tournament should take place in October and November, following the conclusion of the domestic season. However, that clashes with England’s three-Test series against New Zealand next autumn, details of which the Rugby Football League confirmed on Tuesday. That lends weight to the suggestion that the England Knights concept – an emerging talent side similar to union’s England Saxons – may return to play in the tournament. Egan, however, would be keen to see the strongest England side possible travel to Ireland to play in Dublin. He said: “We’re down for a provisional fixture against England in the capital and a game against Italy here, but if it’s an England B team that doesn’t work for me.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n New nuclear power stations in the UK can no longer compete with windfarms on price, according to the boss of a German energy company’s green power arm. Hans Bunting, the chief operating officer of renewables at Innogy SE, part of the company that owns the UK energy supplier npower, said offshore windfarms had become mainstream and were destined to become even cheaper because of new, bigger turbines. Asked whether nuclear groups that want to build new reactors in the UK could compete with windfarms on cost, even when their intermittency was taken into account, Bunting replied: “Obviously they can’t.” His comments came after MPs criticised the £30bn cost to consumers for EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and said ministers should revisit the case for new nuclear before proceeding with more projects. Innogy recently secured a subsidy of £74.75 per megawatt hour of power to build a windfarm off the Lincolnshire coast, which is £17.75 cheaper than Hinkley and should be completed about three years earlier. “What we see now [with prices] is with today’s technology. It’s not about tomorrow’s technology, which is about [to come in] 2025, 2027, when Hinkley will most likely come to the grid ... and then it [windfarms] will be even cheaper.” While the company is planning to use the most powerful turbines in the world today for the Lincolnshire windfarm, Bunting said even bigger ones in development would drive costs down further. “A few years ago everyone thought 10MW [turbines] was the maximum, now we’re talking about 15[MW]. It seems the sky is the limit,” he said. “[It] means less turbines for the same capacity, less steel in the ground, less cables, even bigger rotors catching more wind, so it will become cheaper.” However, EDF argued that nuclear was also on a path to lower costs. “Early offshore wind projects started at around £150 per MW\/h and developers have shown they can offer lower prices by repeating projects with an established supply chain – the same is true for nuclear,” an EDF spokesman said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.
