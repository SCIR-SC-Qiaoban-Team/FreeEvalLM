      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n It was the frog that pushed me over the edge. I’ve never been a Harry Potter fan myself – I was already out of kids’ books when they first came out, and those clever grown-up covers weren’t enough to tempt me back – but I’d always admired JK Rowling from afar. Who wouldn’t? A writer whose imagination transfixed the world, whose riches now exceed those of the Queen, but who has founded a children’s charity, pays her taxes in full, and remains both poised and politically engaged: as role models go, it is hard to think of a better one. So I was pleased when my seven-year-old son went Harry Potter crazy. Having never read to himself before, he was suddenly racing through book after book, his bedside light on late into the night. His brother and several of his friends caught the bug – just as the Suez canal flowed through Clarissa Eden’s drawing room, Hogwarts overshadowed our house, as children constantly dashed about on broomsticks, casting spells and looking for snitches. It was impressive to see the “Harry Potter effect” in action: the magical power that, in the two decades since its first publication, has revitalised the children’s publishing industry, encouraged millions of children to read, sold more than 400m copies across the world, and generated a cultural empire worth £20bn. Less pleasant, however, was the realisation that there was a marketing juggernaut poised to capitalise on my son’s enthusiasm. Unlike those first readers 20 years ago, the children discovering Harry Potter now are immediately faced with a multibillion-pound industry trading in Potter-themed “experiences” and paraphernalia.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Lastly, it remarks on the price and scarcity of child care programs in France, especially in the Paris region.\n\nNext, I need to paraphrase the content, retaining the original meaning but reworking the phrases. I'll make sure to keep the context within the parameters of the original article and avoid including any information not provided in the initial text. The primary focus will be to present the current issue in France about lack of support for mothers and insufficient childcare programs.\n\nFinally, I will ensure the paraphrasing is coherent and logical, using varied language.

I will finish with the required ending phrase.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|> \nIn France, prenatal and postnatal medical care is completely covered in public hospitals thanks to the social security system.

When it comes to monetary concerns related to pregnancy and childbirth, things don't appear to be any worse or better for people. However, there is a lack of support for new mothers: paternity leave is only 11 days, insufficient to allow the mother to recover properly post-birth. New mothers are left to navigate a new life while managing their recovery and finding childcare, with state programs often falling short, particularly in the Paris area. Childcare costs vary widely, with daycare centers able to accommodate lower-income families for roughly €1,000 ($1,177.59) annually, but there are too few available spots.

Featuring the work of high-profile and amateur designers, in campaign billboards, T-shirts and cartoons, it will show graphic design’s power as a tool for political discussion, debate and provocation. • Opens 28 March, Design Museum, London.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theresa May has declared that tackling climate change and reducing its effects on poorer countries is a “moral imperative”, as the Conservative party renewed its push to portray itself as environmentally friendly. The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron’s 2005 efforts to show the Tories cared about global warming. Ahead of this week’s climate change summit in Paris, May said: “There is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.” She described coal as “one of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power” and hailed the “enormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents”. May’s commitment to the issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real. However, the prime minister insists “tackling climate change and mitigating its effects for the world’s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces”.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theresa May has declared that tackling climate change and reducing its effects on poorer countries is a “moral imperative”, as the Conservative party renewed its push to portray itself as environmentally friendly. The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron’s 2005 efforts to show the Tories cared about global warming. Ahead of this week’s climate change summit in Paris, May said: “There is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.” She described coal as “one of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power” and hailed the “enormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents”. May’s commitment to the issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real. However, the prime minister insists “tackling climate change and mitigating its effects for the world’s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces”. At the summit she will announce a £140m boost to funding for poorer communities affected by climate change through deforestation or vulnerability to natural disasters and extreme weather, plus £15m of additional support for reconstruction on Dominica in the Caribbean, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September.

Putin said a significant part of Russian forces would be withdrawn from Syria, though scepticism was warranted given that two previous announcements have been met with little noticeable scaling down. This time, however, could be different. Talk of the total defeat of Isis may be premature, but there is no doubt that Russian air power, combined with Syrian forces and Iran-backed Shia militias on the ground, has decisively shifted the balance of power in the long Syrian civil war. President Bashar al-Assad was on the brink of defeat when Russia entered the conflict in 2015. With sustained airstrikes on both moderate rebel groups and extremists, Moscow has helped Assad win back control of much of the country. The Russian and Syrian air forces were accused of brutal bombing tactics, including deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure, which the Russian military has always denied.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Last year, my New Year resolution was to go for a run first thing every morning. It started well: 1 January was a great success. On 2 January, though, I hit snooze and went back to sleep. I tried to get it going again, I really did – I even wore my gym clothes to bed – but nothing worked. This year, I’ve resolved to wean myself off scrolling mindlessly through social media on my phone, but when it comes to making resolutions – or, rather, breaking them – it feels as though there are forces at work far stronger than my willpower. I know I’m not alone in that; if I were, there wouldn’t be nearly 6,000 books on Amazon under the category “self help – habits”, nor so many psychologists researching the subject. So, could they help me keep my resolution this year? Charles Duhigg, the author of The Power of Habit, certainly thinks so. He tells me there is “a ton of research” to show that New Year resolutions are an effective way to make changes: they create a sense of expectation and ceremony, while the link to a particular day helps to fit our experiences into a narrative of before and after, which makes change more likely. “There are people who will decide on 1 January to lose two stone and who will keep it off for the rest of their lives, others who have been smoking two packs a day for over a decade who will decide to quit and who will still not smoke this time next year,” he says.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Last year, my New Year resolution was to go for a run first thing every morning. It started well: 1 January was a great success. On 2 January, though, I hit snooze and went back to sleep. I tried to get it going again, I really did – I even wore my gym clothes to bed – but nothing worked. This year, I’ve resolved to wean myself off scrolling mindlessly through social media on my phone, but when it comes to making resolutions – or, rather, breaking them – it feels as though there are forces at work far stronger than my willpower. I know I’m not alone in that; if I were, there wouldn’t be nearly 6,000 books on Amazon under the category “self help – habits”, nor so many psychologists researching the subject. So, could they help me keep my resolution this year? Charles Duhigg, the author of The Power of Habit, certainly thinks so. He tells me there is “a ton of research” to show that New Year resolutions are an effective way to make changes: they create a sense of expectation and ceremony, while the link to a particular day helps to fit our experiences into a narrative of before and after, which makes change more likely. “There are people who will decide on 1 January to lose two stone and who will keep it off for the rest of their lives, others who have been smoking two packs a day for over a decade who will decide to quit and who will still not smoke this time next year,” he says.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theresa May has been forced to accept more scrutiny of Brexit lawmaking to head off a Tory revolt but is still heading for a showdown over how MPs get to vote on the final deal and whether the date for leaving should be fixed in law. The prime minister made a concession on Monday by agreeing to set up a new committee of MPs to monitor any proposed legal changes as EU legislation is converted into the British statute book. She had been facing a parliamentary defeat over the issue during the debate on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday, after a widespread backbench revolt among remain- and leave-supporting MPs. However, the government has not backed down on its intention to fix the day of Brexit as 29 March 2019 or acceded to the demands of soft Brexit Tory MPs who wanted a meaningful vote on the terms of the final deal before that date. One Conservative rebel said May was in trouble over these two issues because there were enough dissatisfied Conservatives combined with Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and other opposition MPs to defeat the government. The MP said the government and the rebels were currently in a standoff with neither side prepared to back down. However, government sources were confident May had managed to convince enough of her backbenchers not to defy the whip by indicating that a vote was likely to happen well before the date of leaving and promising a second vote on legislation implementing the EU withdrawal agreement hammered out in Brussels on Friday. The appetite for rebellion among Conservative MPs will become clearer during the two days of debate and voting on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday and Wednesday. Up to 25 had threatened to revolt unless May promised more scrutiny over Brexit lawmaking, but No 10’s concessions appear to have allayed concerns among the would-be troublemakers.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Why are people on the left so exercised about how we pay for social care? After all, better-off care home residents who pay their own way are each quietly subsidising to the tune of £12,000 a year those with fewer assets who are funded by councils that negotiate lower fees. What could be more socialist? The truth is that this is an unofficial, unregulated and profoundly unfair tax levied not by the state but, with the state’s connivance, by private care businesses that declare it the only way to make a broken system work. It is also a tax – and a system – unknown to alarming numbers: as a survey published today shows, one in four middle-aged people still think that care and support is free, rising to more than one in three when you include those who aren’t sure. The state of social care shames us all. When the minister responsible, Jackie Doyle-Price, slipped into the Commons one morning last week to administer the last rites to the latest attempt at reform, she was marking 20 years of failure. It was in 1997 that the then Labour health secretary, Frank Dobson, launched a royal commission on the issue with a warning that things “cannot be allowed to continue for much longer”. Since then we have had a dozen white and green papers and plenty of warm words from all sides, but no action – at least none in England, the rest of the UK having gone separate ways. And we shouldn’t expect action any time soon: another green paper setting out proposals is now promised next summer and, as Doyle-Price said, “it is right that we take the time needed to debate the many complex issues and listen to the perspectives of experts and care users”.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Why are people on the left so exercised about how we pay for social care? After all, better-off care home residents who pay their own way are each quietly subsidising to the tune of £12,000 a year those with fewer assets who are funded by councils that negotiate lower fees. What could be more socialist? The truth is that this is an unofficial, unregulated and profoundly unfair tax levied not by the state but, with the state’s connivance, by private care businesses that declare it the only way to make a broken system work. It is also a tax – and a system – unknown to alarming numbers: as a survey published today shows, one in four middle-aged people still think that care and support is free, rising to more than one in three when you include those who aren’t sure. The state of social care shames us all. When the minister responsible, Jackie Doyle-Price, slipped into the Commons one morning last week to administer the last rites to the latest attempt at reform, she was marking 20 years of failure. It was in 1997 that the then Labour health secretary, Frank Dobson, launched a royal commission on the issue with a warning that things “cannot be allowed to continue for much longer”. Since then we have had a dozen white and green papers and plenty of warm words from all sides, but no action – at least none in England, the rest of the UK having gone separate ways. And we shouldn’t expect action any time soon: another green paper setting out proposals is now promised next summer and, as Doyle-Price said, “it is right that we take the time needed to debate the many complex issues and listen to the perspectives of experts and care users”.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The career of Keith Chegwin, who has died aged 60, is characterised by having presented both one of the most popular children’s TV shows in history and a contender for the medium’s most notorious adult entertainment. Viewers saw the best of him in Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (BBC1, 1976-82) and its successor, Saturday Superstore (1982-87), on which Chegwin became an honorary big brother to several generations of goggle-eyed British children, through his cheeky grin and giggle, high-pitched Liverpudlian-accented enthusiasm, and psychedelic knitwear. His presentational worst occurred when Chegwin threw off the novelty sweaters – and, indeed, all clothing except a hat – to front the naturist show Naked (Channel 5, 2000), described by a parliamentarian at the time as the “most disgusting programme ever shown” on British TV. But, while he should be remembered for the work he did with his jolly jumpers on, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for Chegwin, even in his most desperate televisual enterprises. This was due to a natural likability. Only the most sympathetic TV presenters earn nicknames from viewers, and, just as Bruce Forsyth transmuted into “Brucie”, Chegwin rapidly and indelibly became “Cheggers”. That identity was cemented by the title of the third huge success of his children’s career: the music-based gameshow, Cheggers Plays Pop (BBC1, 1978-86), which extended his presenting empire to weekdays. In less prosperous times, though, audiences also admired the impressive and affecting determination with which Cheggers, in the three decades after his Saturday morning career ended, tried to reinvent himself, often against considerable odds. In addition to a common problem for children’s presenters – becoming too old to maintain the required fantasy-sibling dynamic – Chegwin suffered health problems, including alcoholism. Apart from the established presenter-rehab route of reality TV – appearing on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity MasterChef – Chegwin also offered ironic spins on his showbiz rise and fall in 10 projects, including Ricky Gervais’s Extras and Life’s Too Short, and Kill Keith (2011), an improbable comedy-horror Brit film spoof of Tarantino’s Kill Bill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Viewers saw the best of him in Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (BBC1, 1976-82) and its successor, Saturday Superstore (1982-87), on which Chegwin became an honorary big brother to several generations of goggle-eyed British children, through his cheeky grin and giggle, high-pitched Liverpudlian-accented enthusiasm, and psychedelic knitwear. His presentational worst occurred when Chegwin threw off the novelty sweaters – and, indeed, all clothing except a hat – to front the naturist show Naked (Channel 5, 2000), described by a parliamentarian at the time as the “most disgusting programme ever shown” on British TV. But, while he should be remembered for the work he did with his jolly jumpers on, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for Chegwin, even in his most desperate televisual enterprises. This was due to a natural likability. Only the most sympathetic TV presenters earn nicknames from viewers, and, just as Bruce Forsyth transmuted into “Brucie”, Chegwin rapidly and indelibly became “Cheggers”. That identity was cemented by the title of the third huge success of his children’s career: the music-based gameshow, Cheggers Plays Pop (BBC1, 1978-86), which extended his presenting empire to weekdays. In less prosperous times, though, audiences also admired the impressive and affecting determination with which Cheggers, in the three decades after his Saturday morning career ended, tried to reinvent himself, often against considerable odds. In addition to a common problem for children’s presenters – becoming too old to maintain the required fantasy-sibling dynamic – Chegwin suffered health problems, including alcoholism. Apart from the established presenter-rehab route of reality TV – appearing on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity MasterChef – Chegwin also offered ironic spins on his showbiz rise and fall in 10 projects, including Ricky Gervais’s Extras and Life’s Too Short, and Kill Keith (2011), an improbable comedy-horror Brit film spoof of Tarantino’s Kill Bill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is to launch plans for an opt-out system of organ donation, asking people to overcome their “fatal reluctance” to discuss the issue with family and friends. Under the plans, everybody in England would be presumed to be happy to donate their organs on their death, unless they have signed up to a register stating that they do not want that to happen. In practice, however, it is unlikely that organs would be taken against the wishes of the family. The government’s ambition to change the NHS organ donation programme was announced by Theresa May in her Conservative party conference speech in October. Last year, she said, “500 people died because a suitable organ was not available. And there are 6,500 on the transplant list today.” NHS Blood and Transplant’s figures show that 1,100 families in the UK decided not to allow organ donation because they were unsure, or did not know whether their relatives would have wanted to donate an organ or not. “Every day, three people die for want of a transplant, which is why our historic plans to transform the way organ donation works are so important. We want as many people as possible to have their say as we shape the new opt-out process,” said Hunt. “As well as changing the law, we also need to change the conversation – it can be a difficult subject to broach, but overcoming this fatal reluctance to talk openly about our wishes is key to saving many more lives in the future.” The consultation will ask three questions: how much say should families have in their deceased relative’s decision to donate their organs?

    "response":"<|begin_of_thought|>\nThe task here is to paraphrase the initial part of a news article published in The Guardian. The main themes are economic recovery under the Tories, the potential for a digital economy to boost Britain's economy and living standards, and the historical context of Britain's scientific contributions. The news text has several dense points about past recovery periods, current wages, the digital economy's potential, and specific numbers about its current status. \n\n\\n\\nTo paraphrase effectively, I need to maintain the central argument that Britain could leverage its digital economy to rejuvenate economic growth and living standards. I should also note the comparison with the recovery after the Great Depression, the projected timeline for improvements in living standards, and the potential wage increase from digital jobs. Keeping these points accurate while altering the phrasing without losing the critical metrics and sentiments expressed by the writer is key to fulfilling the requirements of this task.\n\n\\n\\nFirstly, I will simplify the prose and ensure that the figures and statistics are accurately communicated without changing their context. I need to convey that Britain should redirect its focus towards becoming a leader in the digital economy. In addition, I must also make sure that Britain's pertinence as a locus for the scientific revolution is noted, and the potential benefits of expanding digital employment are conveyed with appropriate emphasis.\n\n\\n\\nThe purpose for these changes is to ensure the readers understand the gravitas of the current economic conditions while still being inspired by Britain's potential to reinvent itself economically through digital transformation.

However, digital jobs offer a premium of 40% over the average wage, equating to an extra £190 weekly. Emphasizing the digital sector could be a swift path to a national increase in wages.

Thus, to propel Britain forward, we must set a new target - becoming a global leader in the digital economy. Currently, only about 1.5 million jobs, or roughly 4% of the workforce, are digital-based. However, digital jobs offer a premium of 40% over the average wage, equating to an extra £190 weekly. Emphasizing the digital sector could be a swift path to a national increase in wages. Historically, Britain was at the heart of the scientific revolution. Is there anything else I can help with? \n\nP.P.S. This paraphrasing retains the original text's spirit and maintains exact fact-checking and sentiment. <|end_of_solution|>",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n When Carla Bruni, the Italian-born, French-raised heiress and supermodel quit the catwalk to reinvent herself as a singer-songwriter 20 years ago, many thought it would be short-lived dilettantism. Yet Bruni surprised her detractors, showing herself to be a talented songwriter and a careful, nuanced singer whose jazzy chansons soon topped the French charts. She has continued to do so, even after the inevitable hiatus to her musical career caused by marrying Nicolas Sarkozy, and spending 2008-12 in the Élysée as France’s first lady. She has spoken of suffering from crippling stage fright, but this still-gamine figure, fronting a four-piece, light-jazz band, exudes preternatural poise. Bruni moves with beatific grace, recalling Karl Lagerfeld’s praise of her as “this beautiful creature who can wear anything”; her husky whisper could be a parody of a breathy Gallic siren. Her latest album is a set of cover versions sung in English, French Touch, which is a decidedly mixed bag. It largely works because Bruni pours herself into the songs as if in thrall to them: her pitch-perfect, sparse croon through Depeche Mode’s Enjoy the Silence identifies and amplifies the bleak yearning at the song’s core. The quirky arrangements can be eccentric. Bruni’s cod-jazz take on Willie Nelson’s Crazy veers near to lift muzak, while the jaunty noodling her band introduce to Lou Reed’s Perfect Day sounds at odds with the song’s dark soul. The Clash’s Jimmy Jazz is transformed into a previously unknown genre that can only be described as ethereal boogie-woogie.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Next, for art enthusiasts, the National Art Pass at £65 (or £97 for two cards) from http:\/\/artfund.org affords access to over 240 cultural venues and reduced admission to numerous exhibitions across the UK, all unified under one card. There's also a home exercise option - the TRX gear with a yearly membership priced at £179.95, featured at http:\/\/trxtraining.co.uk.

The setup comes with a plethora of video sessions for use. A seductive offering is the Like the Wind magazine, available annually for £32 at http:\/\/likethewindmagazine.com, a beautifully designed magazine centered around running with original artworks, narrative storytelling purely from the hearts and minds of runners. Weekly editions are true pieces of art that can even be framed and ordered from the online store.

    "response":"SECTION 1\n\nTo gain insight into one of the key attributes of creativity, one needs to visit an art classroom in Denver, Colorado. The instructor guides the pupils to follow the technique of famous artist Vassily Kandinsky. The students recreate Kandinsky’s geometric patterns, perfect the brushstrokes, and become acquainted with color theory. If the lesson were to end here, it would merely showcase an interactive session of art history. However, the teacher takes it a step further by asking the students to disassemble their paintings and construct 3D sculptures from the fragments. Although they all begin with the same inspiration, their outcomes are remarkably distinct, with some sculptures towering straight up and others being a collage of varied shapes and angles. This classroom activity serves as an effective method to teach the students that the past is not a final destination, but a point to propel further.\n\nCreativity does not spontaneously appear; it is a process that evolves through derivation and extrapolation. Every idea is built upon pre-existing thoughts and concepts, with no notion existing in a vacuum as a wholly original entity. Understanding this linkage between the known and the new is crucial for fostering creativity among students.

    "filtered_answer":"SECTION 1\n\nTo gain insight into one of the key attributes of creativity, one needs to visit an art classroom in Denver, Colorado. The instructor guides the pupils to follow the technique of famous artist Vassily Kandinsky. The students recreate Kandinsky’s geometric patterns, perfect the brushstrokes, and become acquainted with color theory. If the lesson were to end here, it would merely showcase an interactive session of art history. However, the teacher takes it a step further by asking the students to disassemble their paintings and construct 3D sculptures from the fragments. Although they all begin with the same inspiration, their outcomes are remarkably distinct, with some sculptures towering straight up and others being a collage of varied shapes and angles. This classroom activity serves as an effective method to teach the students that the past is not a final destination, but a point to propel further.\n\nCreativity does not spontaneously appear; it is a process that evolves through derivation and extrapolation. Every idea is built upon pre-existing thoughts and concepts, with no notion existing in a vacuum as a wholly original entity. Understanding this linkage between the known and the new is crucial for fostering creativity among students. The art lesson in Denver serves as an excellent example of how students can be encouraged to think beyond traditional boundaries and traditional art forms, thus nurturing their thinking and creative skills.\n\nSECTION 2\n\n<|begin_of_thought|> The given text discusses the creative process fostered in an art classroom through the replication and evolution of Vassily Kandinsky's work.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n To non-vegans, the idea of a plant-based Christmas dinner may smack of Scrooge crouched over a miserly candle, sucking on a single slice of tofu. There are few holidays more dedicated to tearing up the five-a-day-guidelines than this one, so if you take away not only the meat but the cream, then what’s left? Actually, this year there’s a lot left, as supermarkets are increasingly wise to the idea that plenty of vegans want to stuff their faces, too. With estimates that between 2 and 12% of British people now follow a vegetarian diet, it’s unsurprising that a vegetarian Christmas is well catered for by shops, but the rise of the “flexitarian” means that even non-vegans may buy and try vegan now, if it’s an option. It takes a bit of supermarket-hopping and a familiarity with an online checkout to do it, but with a little effort, there’s now a gluttonous array of choice. Christmas dinner is a roast with bits added on, and the majority of a roast is vegan anyway. There are a few tweaks that may need to be made – use oil to roast the potatoes instead of fat; swap butter for olive oil in the mash, and leave honey off the parsnips and carrots (you could swap in maple or agave syrup for sweetness). When it comes to the star of the show, the amount of effort you’re willing to put in will dictate your centrepiece. The ever-reliable Linda McCartney range’s new “roast beef” joint comes with a boozy-tasting red wine glaze and a remarkably beef-like flavour, which is great for vegans who like the taste of meat but not the methods, though it may be too meaty for some. Fry’s soy and quinoa Country Roast is a solid herby veggie roast, while Tofurky’s turkey and stuffing is a respectable substitute for the real thing.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n To non-vegans, the idea of a plant-based Christmas dinner may smack of Scrooge crouched over a miserly candle, sucking on a single slice of tofu. There are few holidays more dedicated to tearing up the five-a-day-guidelines than this one, so if you take away not only the meat but the cream, then what’s left? Actually, this year there’s a lot left, as supermarkets are increasingly wise to the idea that plenty of vegans want to stuff their faces, too. With estimates that between 2 and 12% of British people now follow a vegetarian diet, it’s unsurprising that a vegetarian Christmas is well catered for by shops, but the rise of the “flexitarian” means that even non-vegans may buy and try vegan now, if it’s an option. It takes a bit of supermarket-hopping and a familiarity with an online checkout to do it, but with a little effort, there’s now a gluttonous array of choice. Christmas dinner is a roast with bits added on, and the majority of a roast is vegan anyway. There are a few tweaks that may need to be made – use oil to roast the potatoes instead of fat; swap butter for olive oil in the mash, and leave honey off the parsnips and carrots (you could swap in maple or agave syrup for sweetness). When it comes to the star of the show, the amount of effort you’re willing to put in will dictate your centrepiece. The ever-reliable Linda McCartney range’s new “roast beef” joint comes with a boozy-tasting red wine glaze and a remarkably beef-like flavour, which is great for vegans who like the taste of meat but not the methods, though it may be too meaty for some. Fry’s soy and quinoa Country Roast is a solid herby veggie roast, while Tofurky’s turkey and stuffing is a respectable substitute for the real thing.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"<<Plant-Based Christmas>>\n\nTo those not adhering to a vegan diet, the concept of a plant-based Christmas feast might appear as bleak as a lonely Scrooge illuminating his snug with a solitary candle, nibbling on a lone piece of tofu. During holidays like these, one tends to forsake health recommendations, so taking away both meat and dairy might seem like a daunting task. However, this year, there is a significant amount of plant-based options available, primarily due to supermarkets becoming more aware of vegan needs. With between 2% and 12% of the British population reportedly following a vegetarian lifestyle, it is unsurprising that supermarkets are adroit at catering to these requirements. The rise of flexitarians also contributes to the growth of vegan dishes, as some non-vegans are also keen to try vegan alternatives. It demands a bit of effort, such as visiting multiple stores and online shopping, but there is now a vast array of options available. Christmas dinner mainly consists of a roast with various accompaniments, most of which can be made vegan. Some adjustments might be required, like using oil for roasting potatoes instead of fat, substituting butter with olive oil for mashed potatoes, and refraining from adding honey to parsnips and carrots (maple or agave syrup can be used instead).\n\nThe centerpiece of the meal will largely depend on personal preferences and the time one is willing to invest. Linda McCartney's new \"roast beef\" joint, which boasts a wine-flavored glaze and a convincing beef-like taste, might suit those who appreciate the taste of meat without subscribing to its production methods. Another option is Fry's soy and quinoa Country Roast, known for its herbal flavor. Lastly, Tofurky's turkey and stuffing can serve as a viable replacement for the traditional turkey.\n\nAny other questions?",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The rather unexpected allusion by the prime minister this week in a speech to the Business Council of Australia to the government’s pursuit of further income tax cuts is not one that should be treated with too much respect until he also talks about how to pay for them. With the return to surplus built on income tax revenue, any income tax cuts are unlikely to come before the next decade without either increases in other taxes or big cuts to government services. Amid the usual “free markets are great” rah-rah that the prime minister doled out to the Business Council of Australia on Monday night, Malcolm Turnbull also slipped in a line on income tax cuts, noting that he was: “Actively working with the treasurer and all my cabinet colleagues to ease the burden on middle-income Australians, while also meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” This was a bit of a surprise given the current state of the budget is such that the government is projecting that a return to surplus only in 2020-21and that net debt at that point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP. Even in the best of times, promising income tax cuts as the budget is in deficit is a courageous position to take for a political party that likes to prides itself on “budget responsibility”.It is even more courageous when the path back to surplus is built on a foundation of income tax revenue. Individual’s income tax has always been the biggest tax in the budget. During the mining-boom years it declined slightly in importance as company tax exploded in value from 3.3% of GDP in 1998-99 to5.3% of GDP in 2005-06. But in the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for just over half of all tax revenue. Now that in itself is a bit of a problem (the IMF and OECD have made calls for Australia to lessen its reliance on income tax) but it is a bigger problem for Turnbull and his call for tax cuts while also “meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” The issue it that of the extra $88.1bn in tax revenue the government hopes to gain between now and 2020-21, $48.5bn of it is to come from individual income tax. This means that income tax is actually bearing a greater burden of the increase in tax than would be expected. Income tax makes up 50.6% of total tax revenue, but accounts for 55% of the increase in tax revenue between now and 2020-21.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The rather unexpected allusion by the prime minister this week in a speech to the Business Council of Australia to the government’s pursuit of further income tax cuts is not one that should be treated with too much respect until he also talks about how to pay for them. With the return to surplus built on income tax revenue, any income tax cuts are unlikely to come before the next decade without either increases in other taxes or big cuts to government services. Amid the usual “free markets are great” rah-rah that the prime minister doled out to the Business Council of Australia on Monday night, Malcolm Turnbull also slipped in a line on income tax cuts, noting that he was: “Actively working with the treasurer and all my cabinet colleagues to ease the burden on middle-income Australians, while also meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” This was a bit of a surprise given the current state of the budget is such that the government is projecting that a return to surplus only in 2020-21and that net debt at that point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP. Even in the best of times, promising income tax cuts as the budget is in deficit is a courageous position to take for a political party that likes to prides itself on “budget responsibility”.It is even more courageous when the path back to surplus is built on a foundation of income tax revenue. Individual’s income tax has always been the biggest tax in the budget. During the mining-boom years it declined slightly in importance as company tax exploded in value from 3.3% of GDP in 1998-99 to5.3% of GDP in 2005-06. But in the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for just over half of all tax revenue. Now that in itself is a bit of a problem (the IMF and OECD have made calls for Australia to lessen its reliance on income tax) but it is a bigger problem for Turnbull and his call for tax cuts while also “meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” The issue it that of the extra $88.1bn in tax revenue the government hopes to gain between now and 2020-21, $48.5bn of it is to come from individual income tax. This means that income tax is actually bearing a greater burden of the increase in tax than would be expected. Income tax makes up 50.6% of total tax revenue, but accounts for 55% of the increase in tax revenue between now and 2020-21.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Answer with at least 311 words. Do not include keywords ['metal', 'painting', 'peak', 'player', 'she'] in the response. There should be 5 paragraphs.

I will substitute phrases and sentences with corresponding alternatives that communicate the same content. The goal is to maintain the essence and tone of the original article while presenting the information newly.\n\nThe provided passage covers the Australian Prime Minister's reluctant allusion to income tax cuts amidst a fiscal context that seems to deter such a policy. The article criticizes the current state of the budget which projects a surplus in 2020-21 with a significant debt of $366bn. It underlines that the government’s reliance on income tax is high, compromising any potential initiative for tax cuts. Lastly, it points out that income tax contributes a larger portion of the increase in tax revenue than its current share of the total.

Technology, while promising in driving economic growth, has not been the primary driver in improving the current state of the Australian budget, as it remains in deficit with a projected surplus only in 2020-21 and net debt at the point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP. \n\nMalcolm Turnbull's reference to pursuing income tax cuts in a speech to the Business Council of Australia is not likely to be taken seriously without a credible proposal for how to finance them. This statement contradicts the government's position that tax cuts would only come after achieving a budget surplus, which the government expects by the next decade, barring any increase in other taxes or large cuts to government services.\n\nDuring the mining boom years, the increased company tax almost doubled from 3.3% of GDP in 1998-1999 to 5.3% of GDP in 2005-2006, reducing individual income tax's share to some degree. However, recently, individual income tax has accounted for more than half of all tax revenue and is expected to continue shouldering a larger proportion of the projected $88.1bn in tax revenue over the next few years.\n\nAdditionally, a significant $48.5bn increase in individual income tax is vital in these projections. This implies that income tax is taking on a greater portion of the increase in taxation than might be expected, considering its current share of overall tax revenue — approximately 50.6%. However, a significant 55% of the increase in tax revenue between now and 2020-21 will arise from income tax.\n\nInternational institutions like the IMF and the OECD have recommended diversifying tax revenue sources beyond individual income tax. Nevertheless, the Australian government has not yet shifted its stance. Instead of proposing any meaningful diversification, they appear to be constrained by their own fiscal position and policies, making it extremely challenging to entertain proposals for drastic tax cuts.\n<|end_of_solution|>",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Olivia Mead, a millionaire heiress whose list of expenses included a $1.2m crystal-encrusted grand piano and $2,000 annual upkeep of her pet axolotl, has had her inheritance cut from $25m to $6.14m following an appeal from her deceased father’s estate. The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father’s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have “any involvement or association whatsoever” with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than “traditional” Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead’s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court’s master, Craig Sanderson, said would “not fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community”. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright’s estate, acting on behalf of Wright’s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later. On Wednesday, the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court set aside Sanderson’s orders, ruling that while Sanderson was correct to say that Mead had been inadequately provided for in the original will: “The exercise of his discretion to order that provision be made for the respondent in the sum of $25m was flawed.” In a lengthy written judgment, the court found that Sanderson made a number of “material errors” in calculating the size of Mead’s inheritance, saying the focus should have been on what constituted “proper maintenance” and that the initial finding that Mead was “honest” and “not a gold-digger” were not relevant. “The capital sum should be sufficient to enable the respondent to purchase a reasonably substantial house with part of the capital sum and to invest the balance so that she will receive a reasonably substantial annuity for the remainder of her life,” the appeal court’s president, Michael Buss, said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

I divided the text into smaller parts and summarised the findings as follows:\\n\\n- The former top official for internet censorship in China, Lu Wei, is under investigation for corruption by the Communist Party's anti-corruption agency.\\n\\n- Lu Wei was the head of the Cyberspace Administration of China from 2014 until June 2016, and represented China's model for internet control.\\n\\n- He met with tech giants like Facebook, Amazon, and Apple, and facilitated meetings with these companies when they visited China.\\n\\n- Lu is being investigated for \"serious disciplinary violations,\" which is a euphemism for corruption according to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.\\n\\n- He left his role in 2016, speculations about losing favour began.\\n\\n- President Xi Jinping has led a wide-ranging anti-corruption drive since coming to power five years ago, claiming that corruption is the paramount threat to the ruling Communist Party. \\n\\n- Nearly 1.4 million party members have been punished, and Xi vowed to continue fighting corruption during his second term.\\n\\n- Critics believe that some parts of the anti-corruption drive have been used to eliminate Xi's rivals and political factions opposing him.\\n\\n- Lu is the most prominent official implicated since Xi's second term began, and the anti-corruption agency regarded it as evidence of the ongoing drive.\\n\\n\\nConsidering these points, I started constructing the paraphrased version by ensuring the integrity of the core idea and avoiding direct copying or plagiarism. I used synonyms and restructures sentences to deliver the same message with a fresh perspective.\\n\\nBefore finalizing the paraphrased version, I did a detailed check on the paraphrased content, verifying its accuracy and ensuring the context and facts remain unchanged. <|end_of_thought|>\n<|begin_of_solution|> {\n\"paraphrased_news_article\": \"The former top official responsible for internet censorship in China, who visited Silicon Valley to promote China's vision for the web, is under investigation by the Communist Party's anti-corruption agency for corruption.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n As the Queensland election campaign heads into its final stretch, Labor’s main message of “chaos” under a Liberal National party-One Nation government has been damaged by one of its own, while Adani continues to cause headaches for both major parties. With Queenslanders preparing to head to the polls on Saturday, no clear victor has emerged, leaving both the LNP and Labor scrambling to bed down seats. Labor has consolidated its message to one line – “a clear choice” – as it seeks to highlight what it says will be the “cuts and chaos” under a Tim Nicholls-led government. The LNP leader has said he is willing to work with One Nation in the event of a hung parliament. But the Labor campaign is reeling from the damage done by one of its own MPs, the former police minister Jo-Ann Miller, who sought out the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, in front of the media on Tuesday, embracing her and presenting her with a gift for her new grandson. Media at the event have reported that One Nation was aware of Miller’s intentions. Miller and Labor have maintained it was a coincidence of the campaign and a “common decency” to present a gift for a new baby. But the friendly meeting may have damaged Labor’s attempts to paint itself as standing apart from Hanson’s party, which is predicted to take seats across north and central Queensland, as well as some outer-urban electorates in the south-east. “The real issue here is what is going to happen in three days’ time, on Saturday,” Annastacia Palaszczuk said from Bundaberg on Wednesday, moments before her team attempted to keep her away from signs declaring: “It’ll be grim under Tim.” The placement of “grim” seemed a little too close for comfort for those focused on optics. “That is the real fundamental issue and it is about a choice, it is fundamentally about a clear choice,” she said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Here are the five charts you need to see before the red briefcase creaks open a bit after midday. * * * The reluctant idol – David Cassidy, star of The Partridge Family, has died aged 67.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Australia’s richest woman, mining magnate Gina Rinehart, has awarded Barnaby Joyce $40,000 for services to the agricultural sector. At a gala dinner in Canberra on Tuesday, Rinehart gave the inaugural agricultural and related industries award to Joyce, describing him as a “champion of the industry”. Labor immediately took aim at the award, with the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, labelling it a “$40,000 cash present”. Joyce has said he will refuse the cash. The Nationals leader, a close personal friend of Rinehart and former agriculture and water minister, is currently battling for his political life in the New England byelection after the high court ruled him ineligible to sit in parliament because of dual New Zealand citizenship. Rinehart thanked Joyce for taking “time out of your campaigning schedule to come here – to be here for the industry you love and support”. “What a great voice for Australian agriculture,” she said. “The agricultural industry is fortunate to have had such a dedicated, understanding and enthusiastic minister – one with years of first-hand experience – a real Aussie country boy and boy, do we hope you return.” Footage of the event shows Joyce stood up to accept the award and giant cheque, before modestly exclaiming “hooley dooley – rightio”. In addition to being the chair of Hancock Prospecting, Rinehart has extensive agricultural holdings and is the part owner of the $386m S Kidman and Co cattle company which has leasehold over 80,000 sq km in Australia’s north. At a press conference on Wednesday, Shorten asked: “Why is a mining millionaire giving a Turnbull government minister a $40,000 cash present?\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.
