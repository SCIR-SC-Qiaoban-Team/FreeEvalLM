      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n It was the frog that pushed me over the edge. I’ve never been a Harry Potter fan myself – I was already out of kids’ books when they first came out, and those clever grown-up covers weren’t enough to tempt me back – but I’d always admired JK Rowling from afar. Who wouldn’t? A writer whose imagination transfixed the world, whose riches now exceed those of the Queen, but who has founded a children’s charity, pays her taxes in full, and remains both poised and politically engaged: as role models go, it is hard to think of a better one. So I was pleased when my seven-year-old son went Harry Potter crazy. Having never read to himself before, he was suddenly racing through book after book, his bedside light on late into the night. His brother and several of his friends caught the bug – just as the Suez canal flowed through Clarissa Eden’s drawing room, Hogwarts overshadowed our house, as children constantly dashed about on broomsticks, casting spells and looking for snitches. It was impressive to see the “Harry Potter effect” in action: the magical power that, in the two decades since its first publication, has revitalised the children’s publishing industry, encouraged millions of children to read, sold more than 400m copies across the world, and generated a cultural empire worth £20bn. Less pleasant, however, was the realisation that there was a marketing juggernaut poised to capitalise on my son’s enthusiasm. Unlike those first readers 20 years ago, the children discovering Harry Potter now are immediately faced with a multibillion-pound industry trading in Potter-themed “experiences” and paraphernalia.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The article mentions wage-earning women's eligibility for a 16-week maternity leave with a compensation range based on their salary before taking the leave. It also highlights that the financial burden doesn't increase due to pregnancy or childbirth, but the support for young mothers post-birth is insufficient. Paternity leave in the country is limited to 11 days, which isn't enough for mothers to heal and adjust to new responsibilities. \n\nNext, the article focuses on the challenge of childcare for new mothers in France. It mentions public daycare options existing, but they are insufficient, particularly in Paris. Families with lower incomes find it possible to make ends meet for a yearly 1,000-euro daycare fee, but competition for places is high. Consequently, families often rely on private childcare methods such as hiring childminders or in-home care.\n\nThis insight should be paraphrased.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n New Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge, by Jamie Fobert Not an art gallery, but a home for “stray objects, stones, glass, pictures, sculpture, in light and in space,” is how former Tate curator Jim Ede described Kettle’s Yard, the Cambridge house where he arranged his stunning collection of 20th-century art alongside found objects, later donated to the university. Originally extended by modernist architect Leslie Martin in 1970, it has now received a sensitive £8.7m expansion by Jamie Fobert, including remodelled gallery spaces and an education wing, cafe and shop around a new courtyard. • Opens 10 February, Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge. Hope to Nope: Politics and Graphics 2008-2018 at the Design Museum From the endless imitations of Shepard Fairey’s seminal Hope poster for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, to the inventive plethora of Donald Trump memes, this exhibition will show how graphic design’s engagement with politics has evolved over the last decade. Featuring the work of high-profile and amateur designers, in campaign billboards, T-shirts and cartoons, it will show graphic design’s power as a tool for political discussion, debate and provocation. • Opens 28 March, Design Museum, London. Windermere Jetty Museum by Carmody Groarke A cluster of copper-clad sheds nestles on the edge of Windermere in the Lake District, signalling the new home for the Jetty Museum, a fascinating little institution that has been telling the story of boats and boatsmen since the 1940s. The new £16m complex includes a wet dock, allowing boats to be displayed on water within the museum, and a new workshop for visitors to see the conservation of steam launches, sailing yachts and motor boats in action. • Opens 2018, Windermere Jetty Museum, Bowness-on-Windermere. Royal Academy of Arts development by David Chipperfield “A small amount of architecture for a profound result,” is how Sir David Chipperfield describes his £50m series of surgical interventions in the Royal Academy’s two-acre site, designed to link Burlington House on Piccadilly with Burlington Gardens, behind it, for the first time.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n New Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge, by Jamie Fobert Not an art gallery, but a home for “stray objects, stones, glass, pictures, sculpture, in light and in space,” is how former Tate curator Jim Ede described Kettle’s Yard, the Cambridge house where he arranged his stunning collection of 20th-century art alongside found objects, later donated to the university. Originally extended by modernist architect Leslie Martin in 1970, it has now received a sensitive £8.7m expansion by Jamie Fobert, including remodelled gallery spaces and an education wing, cafe and shop around a new courtyard. • Opens 10 February, Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge. Hope to Nope: Politics and Graphics 2008-2018 at the Design Museum From the endless imitations of Shepard Fairey’s seminal Hope poster for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, to the inventive plethora of Donald Trump memes, this exhibition will show how graphic design’s engagement with politics has evolved over the last decade. Featuring the work of high-profile and amateur designers, in campaign billboards, T-shirts and cartoons, it will show graphic design’s power as a tool for political discussion, debate and provocation. • Opens 28 March, Design Museum, London. Windermere Jetty Museum by Carmody Groarke A cluster of copper-clad sheds nestles on the edge of Windermere in the Lake District, signalling the new home for the Jetty Museum, a fascinating little institution that has been telling the story of boats and boatsmen since the 1940s. The new £16m complex includes a wet dock, allowing boats to be displayed on water within the museum, and a new workshop for visitors to see the conservation of steam launches, sailing yachts and motor boats in action. • Opens 2018, Windermere Jetty Museum, Bowness-on-Windermere. Royal Academy of Arts development by David Chipperfield “A small amount of architecture for a profound result,” is how Sir David Chipperfield describes his £50m series of surgical interventions in the Royal Academy’s two-acre site, designed to link Burlington House on Piccadilly with Burlington Gardens, behind it, for the first time.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n It is rare to come across a work of history that so obviously wants to be a literary masterpiece. Roughly the length of War and Peace, The House of Government aims to capture the rise and fall of Bolshevism through a building and its residents, via a study in eschatology – the creation of an apocalyptic cult, its unexpected success, and its equally unexpected failure. It is a dizzying book, a hall of mirrors, panoramic and bizarre, as puzzlingly esoteric and thrillingly fervent as the doctrines it describes. Whether it succeeds in what it tries to do – essentially, to write a totally new history of the Russian revolution, cast in the mould of a teeming historical novel – is questionable. That there is nothing else like it is indisputable. We should begin where the author does not, with the building. Slezkine is best known to non-specialists for The Jewish Century, a lively revisionist history that placed the Soviet Union at the heart of 20th-century Jewish experience, but in the academy he might be better known for his essay The USSR as a Communal Apartment, a pivotal study of Soviet multinationalism through the spatial\/architectural metaphor of a crowded, thinly subdivided “kommunalka” flat. The House of Government was another, larger block of flats, completed in 1931, “a place where revolutionaries came home and the revolution came to die”. It was designed in the late 1920s by the architect Boris Iofan for the Soviet elite. Its tenants were decimated in the Great Purge, leading to the later nickname “the House of Preliminary Detention”.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n It is rare to come across a work of history that so obviously wants to be a literary masterpiece. Roughly the length of War and Peace, The House of Government aims to capture the rise and fall of Bolshevism through a building and its residents, via a study in eschatology – the creation of an apocalyptic cult, its unexpected success, and its equally unexpected failure. It is a dizzying book, a hall of mirrors, panoramic and bizarre, as puzzlingly esoteric and thrillingly fervent as the doctrines it describes. Whether it succeeds in what it tries to do – essentially, to write a totally new history of the Russian revolution, cast in the mould of a teeming historical novel – is questionable. That there is nothing else like it is indisputable. We should begin where the author does not, with the building. Slezkine is best known to non-specialists for The Jewish Century, a lively revisionist history that placed the Soviet Union at the heart of 20th-century Jewish experience, but in the academy he might be better known for his essay The USSR as a Communal Apartment, a pivotal study of Soviet multinationalism through the spatial\/architectural metaphor of a crowded, thinly subdivided “kommunalka” flat. The House of Government was another, larger block of flats, completed in 1931, “a place where revolutionaries came home and the revolution came to die”. It was designed in the late 1920s by the architect Boris Iofan for the Soviet elite. Its tenants were decimated in the Great Purge, leading to the later nickname “the House of Preliminary Detention”.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theresa May has declared that tackling climate change and reducing its effects on poorer countries is a “moral imperative”, as the Conservative party renewed its push to portray itself as environmentally friendly. The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron’s 2005 efforts to show the Tories cared about global warming. Ahead of this week’s climate change summit in Paris, May said: “There is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.” She described coal as “one of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power” and hailed the “enormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents”. May’s commitment to the issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real. However, the prime minister insists “tackling climate change and mitigating its effects for the world’s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces”. At the summit she will announce a £140m boost to funding for poorer communities affected by climate change through deforestation or vulnerability to natural disasters and extreme weather, plus £15m of additional support for reconstruction on Dominica in the Caribbean, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. It comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being asked by party officials to show off their green credentials after internal polling showed the level of concern among younger voters about environmental issues. The party has been alarmed by the backlash against May’s support for a free vote on foxhunting, the omission of a ban on the ivory trade from the manifesto and its lack of support for an amendment that would have recognised in UK law that animals feel pain. They have since backtracked on all three issues.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  At the end of your response, please explicitly add a postscript starting with P.S."

President Bashar al-Assad was on the brink of defeat when Russia entered the conflict in 2015. With sustained airstrikes on both moderate rebel groups and extremists, Moscow has helped Assad win back control of much of the country.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Last year, my New Year resolution was to go for a run first thing every morning. It started well: 1 January was a great success. On 2 January, though, I hit snooze and went back to sleep. I tried to get it going again, I really did – I even wore my gym clothes to bed – but nothing worked. This year, I’ve resolved to wean myself off scrolling mindlessly through social media on my phone, but when it comes to making resolutions – or, rather, breaking them – it feels as though there are forces at work far stronger than my willpower. I know I’m not alone in that; if I were, there wouldn’t be nearly 6,000 books on Amazon under the category “self help – habits”, nor so many psychologists researching the subject. So, could they help me keep my resolution this year? Charles Duhigg, the author of The Power of Habit, certainly thinks so.

It started well: 1 January was a great success. On 2 January, though, I hit snooze and went back to sleep. I tried to get it going again, I really did – I even wore my gym clothes to bed – but nothing worked. This year, I’ve resolved to wean myself off scrolling mindlessly through social media on my phone, but when it comes to making resolutions – or, rather, breaking them – it feels as though there are forces at work far stronger than my willpower. I know I’m not alone in that; if I were, there wouldn’t be nearly 6,000 books on Amazon under the category “self help – habits”, nor so many psychologists researching the subject. So, could they help me keep my resolution this year? Charles Duhigg, the author of The Power of Habit, certainly thinks so. He tells me there is “a ton of research” to show that New Year resolutions are an effective way to make changes: they create a sense of expectation and ceremony, while the link to a particular day helps to fit our experiences into a narrative of before and after, which makes change more likely. “There are people who will decide on 1 January to lose two stone and who will keep it off for the rest of their lives, others who have been smoking two packs a day for over a decade who will decide to quit and who will still not smoke this time next year,” he says.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Theresa May has been forced to accept more scrutiny of Brexit lawmaking to head off a Tory revolt but is still heading for a showdown over how MPs get to vote on the final deal and whether the date for leaving should be fixed in law. The prime minister made a concession on Monday by agreeing to set up a new committee of MPs to monitor any proposed legal changes as EU legislation is converted into the British statute book. She had been facing a parliamentary defeat over the issue during the debate on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday, after a widespread backbench revolt among remain- and leave-supporting MPs. However, the government has not backed down on its intention to fix the day of Brexit as 29 March 2019 or acceded to the demands of soft Brexit Tory MPs who wanted a meaningful vote on the terms of the final deal before that date. One Conservative rebel said May was in trouble over these two issues because there were enough dissatisfied Conservatives combined with Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and other opposition MPs to defeat the government. The MP said the government and the rebels were currently in a standoff with neither side prepared to back down. However, government sources were confident May had managed to convince enough of her backbenchers not to defy the whip by indicating that a vote was likely to happen well before the date of leaving and promising a second vote on legislation implementing the EU withdrawal agreement hammered out in Brussels on Friday. The appetite for rebellion among Conservative MPs will become clearer during the two days of debate and voting on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday and Wednesday. Up to 25 had threatened to revolt unless May promised more scrutiny over Brexit lawmaking, but No 10’s concessions appear to have allayed concerns among the would-be troublemakers. The government will agree to establish a new committee of MPs to help weed out the overuse of “Henry VIII powers”, which allow ministers to make changes to secondary legislation as it is transposed.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Why are people on the left so exercised about how we pay for social care? After all, better-off care home residents who pay their own way are each quietly subsidising to the tune of £12,000 a year those with fewer assets who are funded by councils that negotiate lower fees. What could be more socialist? The truth is that this is an unofficial, unregulated and profoundly unfair tax levied not by the state but, with the state’s connivance, by private care businesses that declare it the only way to make a broken system work. It is also a tax – and a system – unknown to alarming numbers: as a survey published today shows, one in four middle-aged people still think that care and support is free, rising to more than one in three when you include those who aren’t sure. The state of social care shames us all. When the minister responsible, Jackie Doyle-Price, slipped into the Commons one morning last week to administer the last rites to the latest attempt at reform, she was marking 20 years of failure. It was in 1997 that the then Labour health secretary, Frank Dobson, launched a royal commission on the issue with a warning that things “cannot be allowed to continue for much longer”. Since then we have had a dozen white and green papers and plenty of warm words from all sides, but no action – at least none in England, the rest of the UK having gone separate ways. And we shouldn’t expect action any time soon: another green paper setting out proposals is now promised next summer and, as Doyle-Price said, “it is right that we take the time needed to debate the many complex issues and listen to the perspectives of experts and care users”.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

After all, better-off care home residents who pay their own way are each quietly subsidising to the tune of £12,000 a year those with fewer assets who are funded by councils that negotiate lower fees. What could be more socialist? The truth is that this is an unofficial, unregulated and profoundly unfair tax levied not by the state but, with the state’s connivance, by private care businesses that declare it the only way to make a broken system work. It is also a tax – and a system – unknown to alarming numbers: as a survey published today shows, one in four middle-aged people still think that care and support is free, rising to more than one in three when you include those who aren’t sure. The state of social care shames us all. When the minister responsible, Jackie Doyle-Price, slipped into the Commons one morning last week to administer the last rites to the latest attempt at reform, she was marking 20 years of failure. It was in 1997 that the then Labour health secretary, Frank Dobson, launched a royal commission on the issue with a warning that things “cannot be allowed to continue for much longer”. Since then we have had a dozen white and green papers and plenty of warm words from all sides, but no action – at least none in England, the rest of the UK having gone separate ways. And we shouldn’t expect action any time soon: another green paper setting out proposals is now promised next summer and, as Doyle-Price said, “it is right that we take the time needed to debate the many complex issues and listen to the perspectives of experts and care users”.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Trump declined to re-certify the 2015 multilateral agreement in October, leading to a situation where significant obstacles stand in the way of the deal's continuation. The agreement stipulates that Iran must limit its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.

However, the Senate has chosen not to involve itself in the issue, and allies insist the agreement cannot be renegotiated.

The remaining participants — including the UK, France, Germany, Russia, and China — would then need to decide whether to proceed without the US or permit the deal's collapse, which would certainly escalate tensions.\n\nThe Winter Olympics, which will commence on 9 February in South Korea, will both celebrate winter sports and serve as a litmus test for the region's fluctuating peace.

The 2017 NBA finals averaged 20.4m viewers (a 20-year record), which is roughly the same as the NFL’s regular Sunday night audience of 20.3m, and nowhere near the 2016 Super Bowl über-audience of 111m.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The career of Keith Chegwin, who has died aged 60, is characterised by having presented both one of the most popular children’s TV shows in history and a contender for the medium’s most notorious adult entertainment. Viewers saw the best of him in Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (BBC1, 1976-82) and its successor, Saturday Superstore (1982-87), on which Chegwin became an honorary big brother to several generations of goggle-eyed British children, through his cheeky grin and giggle, high-pitched Liverpudlian-accented enthusiasm, and psychedelic knitwear. His presentational worst occurred when Chegwin threw off the novelty sweaters – and, indeed, all clothing except a hat – to front the naturist show Naked (Channel 5, 2000), described by a parliamentarian at the time as the “most disgusting programme ever shown” on British TV. But, while he should be remembered for the work he did with his jolly jumpers on, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for Chegwin, even in his most desperate televisual enterprises. This was due to a natural likability. Only the most sympathetic TV presenters earn nicknames from viewers, and, just as Bruce Forsyth transmuted into “Brucie”, Chegwin rapidly and indelibly became “Cheggers”. That identity was cemented by the title of the third huge success of his children’s career: the music-based gameshow, Cheggers Plays Pop (BBC1, 1978-86), which extended his presenting empire to weekdays. In less prosperous times, though, audiences also admired the impressive and affecting determination with which Cheggers, in the three decades after his Saturday morning career ended, tried to reinvent himself, often against considerable odds. In addition to a common problem for children’s presenters – becoming too old to maintain the required fantasy-sibling dynamic – Chegwin suffered health problems, including alcoholism. Apart from the established presenter-rehab route of reality TV – appearing on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity MasterChef – Chegwin also offered ironic spins on his showbiz rise and fall in 10 projects, including Ricky Gervais’s Extras and Life’s Too Short, and Kill Keith (2011), an improbable comedy-horror Brit film spoof of Tarantino’s Kill Bill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Though her children are likely to acquire Dutch citizenship, which would grant them numerous privileges and opportunities within the EU, Kate still harbors hesitations about the future. Having spent a significant portion of her career in international environments, Kate is accustomed to frequent cross-border travel for work purposes, crossing into nations like Germany, Poland, and France. However, she is now unsure whether this convenience will continue to be available, raising doubts about future visa requirements and the ability to move around freely.\n***\nSECTION 2\nDespite the recent negotiations, Kate feels that British citizens living abroad are the least addressed and prioritized group in the discussions. While European Union members vehemently protect their nationals, British expatriates feel neglected and overlooked. This sentiment underscores the growing unrest among British expatriates regarding their future post-referendum, particularly when it comes to maintaining their current standard of living and continued borderless mobility. The ongoing uncertainty has caused Kate and her family to reconsider their plans, including moving closer to Maastricht or even relocating to Germany, as they face an unprecedented level of ambiguity regarding their rights and freedoms.\n***\nSECTION 3\nIn alignment with Kate's sentiments, Ken Wood, a 68-year-old retired individual who has resided in France for four years, concurs with this viewpoint. The lack of clear information and guidance on British citizens' rights and privileges in the aftermath of the referendum has stirred anxiety among the expatriate community. This collective sentiment echoes the overarching uncertainty and frustration that British expatriates across Europe are currently experiencing, as they navigate their post-referendum lives and the potential limitations that might arise from it. The uncertainty surrounding their future rights and privileges contributes to an environment of instability and unpredictability, thereby affecting their overall sense of belonging and security within their host countries.\n\"",

When we meet, she’s wearing a Tupac T-shirt – one of four Tupac T-shirts she owns – and a pilot’s jacket, which she bought because it looked a bit like the one Tom Hardy wears in the film Dunkirk. “Because I’ve got a bit of an obsession with him, I walked into Topshop and saw it and thought: ‘Ahhh!’” she says, smiling.

Four fire engines were called to a street in Walkden, Greater Manchester, after the fire broke out at the house at about 5am on Monday. A 14-year-old girl was declared dead at the scene and an eight-year-old boy and seven-year-old girl died in hospital. A three-year-old girl was said to be in a critical condition on Monday afternoon, while a woman, 35, who is understood to be the children’s mother, was in a serious condition.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is to launch plans for an opt-out system of organ donation, asking people to overcome their “fatal reluctance” to discuss the issue with family and friends. Under the plans, everybody in England would be presumed to be happy to donate their organs on their death, unless they have signed up to a register stating that they do not want that to happen. In practice, however, it is unlikely that organs would be taken against the wishes of the family. The government’s ambition to change the NHS organ donation programme was announced by Theresa May in her Conservative party conference speech in October. Last year, she said, “500 people died because a suitable organ was not available. And there are 6,500 on the transplant list today.” NHS Blood and Transplant’s figures show that 1,100 families in the UK decided not to allow organ donation because they were unsure, or did not know whether their relatives would have wanted to donate an organ or not. “Every day, three people die for want of a transplant, which is why our historic plans to transform the way organ donation works are so important. We want as many people as possible to have their say as we shape the new opt-out process,” said Hunt. “As well as changing the law, we also need to change the conversation – it can be a difficult subject to broach, but overcoming this fatal reluctance to talk openly about our wishes is key to saving many more lives in the future.” The consultation will ask three questions: how much say should families have in their deceased relative’s decision to donate their organs?

Samantha, by email Here’s what I think about Emily Ratajkowski: I think we should all think a lot less about Emily Ratajkowski. For those who think so little about her to the point they don’t even know who she is, allow me to catch you up. Ratajkowski is, well, I guess one would call her a model, but it’s a little more complicated than that. She is best known for appearing in the video for Robin Thicke’s once ubiquitous and now totally forgotten 2013 song, Blurred Lines, and since then she has done some acting but primarily made a career out of looking sexy. And sure, why not? You live your life, Emily. Ratajkowski has always made a lot of hay about saying that she’s a feminist, and good for her! Always nice to see a young woman in the public eye embrace the label as opposed to spewing out some moronic brain porridge, such as, “I’m not a feminist – I love men” (side eyes, Shailene Woodley).\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n I see there’s been controversy about Emily Ratajkowski. What is this about? Samantha, by email Here’s what I think about Emily Ratajkowski: I think we should all think a lot less about Emily Ratajkowski. For those who think so little about her to the point they don’t even know who she is, allow me to catch you up. Ratajkowski is, well, I guess one would call her a model, but it’s a little more complicated than that. She is best known for appearing in the video for Robin Thicke’s once ubiquitous and now totally forgotten 2013 song, Blurred Lines, and since then she has done some acting but primarily made a career out of looking sexy. And sure, why not? You live your life, Emily. Ratajkowski has always made a lot of hay about saying that she’s a feminist, and good for her! Always nice to see a young woman in the public eye embrace the label as opposed to spewing out some moronic brain porridge, such as, “I’m not a feminist – I love men” (side eyes, Shailene Woodley).\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Nor is it in that horrible quasi-sheen that we associate with surviving terrible loss. It’s not in the lifestyle choices she made – living in New York one year, relocating to a home right on a California beach another – and it’s not in the interactions she had with Hollywood royalty, from Warren Beatty (who had a crush on her) to Harrison Ford (who worked as her carpenter for a time). It does not lie in the era-defining work she published in the 1960s and 70s, solo or co-written with husband John Gregory Dunne. No, the glamour of Joan Didion is merely in her willingness to try things. Truly, there is nothing more luxe than that: the decision to dip your toe, your foot, your leg and eventually your enitre body into a new endeavour, and just do it. In Joan Didion: The Centre Will Not Hold, a Netflix documentary produced and directed by Didion’s nephew, the actor Griffin Dunne – the writer is endlessly watchable. She is still a sure speaker, and her hands dance in front of her when she’s being emphatic. But it’s all the stories she pursued, the diversifying of her skill set, from magazines to screenplays, as well as the journey into motherhood: all those opportunities grabbed at, with both hands, that really seize you.

Interiors are rustic with stone-flagged floors and beamed ceilings. The coast is 3km away and the bright lights of Larnaca, Limassol and Nicosia within a 30-minute drive. • From £80 a night at Modus Vivendi though i-escape. Flights to Larnaca cost from £69 return with easyJet Best for value: Sri Lanka If the slick five-star resorts of the Seychelles and Maldives are beyond your budget, consider Sri Lanka – same white-sand beaches and clear Indian Ocean waters, but for a fraction of the price.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n When Carla Bruni, the Italian-born, French-raised heiress and supermodel quit the catwalk to reinvent herself as a singer-songwriter 20 years ago, many thought it would be short-lived dilettantism. Yet Bruni surprised her detractors, showing herself to be a talented songwriter and a careful, nuanced singer whose jazzy chansons soon topped the French charts. She has continued to do so, even after the inevitable hiatus to her musical career caused by marrying Nicolas Sarkozy, and spending 2008-12 in the Élysée as France’s first lady. She has spoken of suffering from crippling stage fright, but this still-gamine figure, fronting a four-piece, light-jazz band, exudes preternatural poise. Bruni moves with beatific grace, recalling Karl Lagerfeld’s praise of her as “this beautiful creature who can wear anything”; her husky whisper could be a parody of a breathy Gallic siren. Her latest album is a set of cover versions sung in English, French Touch, which is a decidedly mixed bag. It largely works because Bruni pours herself into the songs as if in thrall to them: her pitch-perfect, sparse croon through Depeche Mode’s Enjoy the Silence identifies and amplifies the bleak yearning at the song’s core. The quirky arrangements can be eccentric. Bruni’s cod-jazz take on Willie Nelson’s Crazy veers near to lift muzak, while the jaunty noodling her band introduce to Lou Reed’s Perfect Day sounds at odds with the song’s dark soul. The Clash’s Jimmy Jazz is transformed into a previously unknown genre that can only be described as ethereal boogie-woogie.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n “I want to die.” Rob and Claire Johnson’s daughter was screaming, hysterical and inconsolable. Ten-year-old Emily told them a boy at school had slapped her, hard, across the face: “I want to die. Nobody believes me. He’s hitting me and nobody believes me.” “We didn’t know what to do,” Rob tells me, his voice echoing the helplessness and frustration he felt. “Hearing her say those words – what parent wants to hear that from their 10-year-old daughter?” When Claire tried to speak to the school about the incident, they quickly dismissed it as “a misunderstanding”, telling her: “Everyone’s happy now.” But Emily was far from happy. Over the subsequent two weeks, she gradually opened up to her parents with the help of her GP. Slowly, she described how the boy in question had sexually harassed and assaulted her over the past 10 months. It emerged that another child had made a detailed report to the school after witnessing the boy intimidating and assaulting Emily. The classmate had told staff it happened in a corner of the playground known as the “sex corner”, where the boy had forced Emily against a wall, pinning her hands on either side of her as he gyrated and rubbed his body against hers. Emily closed her eyes and started crying.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['initiative', 'jacket', 'person', 'picture', 'world'] in the response.

Ten-year-old Emily told them a boy at school had slapped her, hard, across the face: “I want to die. Nobody believes me. He’s hitting me and nobody believes me.” “We didn’t know what to do,” Rob tells me, his voice echoing the helplessness and frustration he felt. “Hearing her say those words – what parent wants to hear that from their 10-year-old daughter?” When Claire tried to speak to the school about the incident, they quickly dismissed it as “a misunderstanding”, telling her: “Everyone’s happy now.” But Emily was far from happy. Over the subsequent two weeks, she gradually opened up to her parents with the help of her GP. Slowly, she described how the boy in question had sexually harassed and assaulted her over the past 10 months. It emerged that another child had made a detailed report to the school after witnessing the boy intimidating and assaulting Emily. The classmate had told staff it happened in a corner of the playground known as the “sex corner”, where the boy had forced Emily against a wall, pinning her hands on either side of her as he gyrated and rubbed his body against hers. Emily closed her eyes and started crying.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['initiative', 'jacket', 'person', 'picture', 'world'] in the response.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Guillermo del Toro’s cold war fantasy The Shape of Water emerged as the frontrunner for the Oscars after picking up a total of seven nominations for the 75th Golden Globes. However, the film looks set to face strong opposition from Steven Spielberg’s Pentagon Papers drama The Post and Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, at a Globes ceremony that will provide the entertainment industry with its first major opportunity to respond to the sexual abuse scandal plaguing Hollywood. Two months after the emergence of allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein that would prompt a further torrent of claims against men in the film industry, the nominations exhibited an already changed landscape in Hollywood. As expected none of the Weinstein-produced films eligible for inclusion received nominations, however there were multiple nominations for Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World, which was forced to replace star Kevin Spacey at short notice, after he was accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and harassment. At the same time, the widely predicted shift towards a more female-focused list of nominees in the wake of the Weinstein scandal did not materialise. Though there were nods for a number of films with female protagonists, including The Shape of Water, Three Billboards, I, Tonya, a biopic of disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding and coming-of-age comedy-drama Lady Bird, there was no room in the nominees for any female directors, while Patty Jenkins’s feminist superhero movie Wonder Woman was snubbed entirely. Leading the way with seven nominations is the Shape of Water, which stars British actor Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaner at a governmental research facility who falls in love with a captured sea creature. Both Del Toro and Hawkins have been nominated in the drama category, for best director and best actress respectively, while Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer have received supporting actor and actress nominations. The film has also received best screenplay and score nominations, as well as best picture in the drama category.

    "response":"SECTION 1\n\nTo uncover one of the keys to fostering creativity, one can examine an art class in Denver, Colorado. In this particular class, the instructor prompts the students to emulate the artistic style of Vassily Kandinsky. The pupils then practice his distinctive geometric abstractions while perfecting their brush technique and understanding color theory. While merely mimicking an artist might seem like a simplified lesson in art history, the teacher goes a step further and instructs the students to dismantle their artwork and construct 3D sculptures using the pieces. The transformation from a single source into a variety of final pieces is striking – some standing tall as columns, while others form intricate mazes of different shapes and angles. Through this exercise, the students realize that the past should not be a limit but a foundation to build upon. Realizing that creativity doesn't spring from nothing, we see that it results from a series of gradual derivations and expansions. Every novel concept isn't born in isolation; there is always a connection between what is familiar and what is to come.\n\nIn this art class, we can see how copying the masters can be an essential starting point for creativity, but it doesn't end there. As much as the students' initial imitation of Kandinsky serves as a grounding point, the second half of their creative process is where the real magic happens. Disassembling their paintings and reconstructing them into 3D sculptures allows each student to put their own personal twists and individuality into the project, resulting in a wide array of unique finished products. This process teaches the students to appreciate how a well-established artistic tradition can be both a source of inspiration and an invitation to develop their own ideas.\n\nAdditionally, this approach demonstrates that there is no definite starting point when it comes to creativity, as the origin of creative ideas can be traced back to earlier inspirations. Thus, while it's true that originality is highly valued, the reality is that an entirely unique concept is almost impossible to create. Instead, creativity is fueled by taking existing ideas and reimagining them or layering them with new perspectives to generate fresh and innovative outcomes. This interactive classroom experience is a perfect representation of how creativity thrives; it allows the students to play with their foundations and develop a deep understanding of how to pivot from what is known to create something extraordinary.",

From her salon at the centre of the cosmopolis, marvellously at one with her books and her learning, she considered, renamed and renewed our relationship with camp, with photography, with illness: a living legend of braininess and cool. Sontag, was not, though, as her editor Benjamin Taylor admits in the introduction to this gathering of stories from across her career, a committed short-story writer. She turned to the form in order to evade what Chekhov called “autobiographophobia”, which Taylor uses to mean the fear of writing and reflecting directly about one’s life. Evading this fear, Sontag clearly found the name “stories” very helpful: half of them are pure autobiography. “Pilgrimage”, for example, which opens the volume, is a memoir of Sontag’s youth in southern California, and an account of her visit with a boyfriend to the home of an ageing Thomas Mann. The only reason why this did not become an essay, it seems, is that the encounter was dull and disappointing, and so difficult to reflect on: Mann had “only sententious formulas to deliver. And I uttered nothing but tongue-tied simplicities, though I was full of complex feeling. We were neither of us at our best.” The next piece, “Project for a Trip to China”, is also memoir: we learn more about Sontag’s childhood (she was a voracious reader and dug deep holes in the garden to sit in); about her habit of ordering ambitiously in restaurants (hundred-year-old eggs); and a little about her father, who worked in China. The piece is more experimental, using lists and tables, characters identified by initials only, and lots of negatives (she does not, predictably, go to China).\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n To non-vegans, the idea of a plant-based Christmas dinner may smack of Scrooge crouched over a miserly candle, sucking on a single slice of tofu. There are few holidays more dedicated to tearing up the five-a-day-guidelines than this one, so if you take away not only the meat but the cream, then what’s left? Actually, this year there’s a lot left, as supermarkets are increasingly wise to the idea that plenty of vegans want to stuff their faces, too. With estimates that between 2 and 12% of British people now follow a vegetarian diet, it’s unsurprising that a vegetarian Christmas is well catered for by shops, but the rise of the “flexitarian” means that even non-vegans may buy and try vegan now, if it’s an option. It takes a bit of supermarket-hopping and a familiarity with an online checkout to do it, but with a little effort, there’s now a gluttonous array of choice. Christmas dinner is a roast with bits added on, and the majority of a roast is vegan anyway. There are a few tweaks that may need to be made – use oil to roast the potatoes instead of fat; swap butter for olive oil in the mash, and leave honey off the parsnips and carrots (you could swap in maple or agave syrup for sweetness). When it comes to the star of the show, the amount of effort you’re willing to put in will dictate your centrepiece. The ever-reliable Linda McCartney range’s new “roast beef” joint comes with a boozy-tasting red wine glaze and a remarkably beef-like flavour, which is great for vegans who like the taste of meat but not the methods, though it may be too meaty for some. Fry’s soy and quinoa Country Roast is a solid herby veggie roast, while Tofurky’s turkey and stuffing is a respectable substitute for the real thing.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"<<Plant-Based Christmas Delights>>\n\nFor those not accustomed to plant-based diets, the idea of a vegan Christmas feast might appear as bleak as Scrooge grumbling over his solitary tofu serving. Typically, Christmas is synonymous with indulgence, often meaning meat and dairy-laden feasts. However, the notion of omitting these elements might seem daunting, leaving many to wonder what remains. In reality, there is an array of options available, as supermarkets are gradually recognizing the burgeoning vegan market.\n\nWith data suggesting that between 2 and 12% of the UK population adheres to vegetarianism, it is unsurprising that there is a considerable selection of vegetarian and vegan Christmas dinner options in stores. Moreover, with the increasing trend of \"flexitarianism,\" even non-vegans are open to trying vegan alternatives.\n\nAn imaginative approach to Christmas dinner should see it as a versatile dish with different elements that can be adapted to suit plant-based diets. A significant portion of a traditional roast is already suitable for vegans, requiring minor adjustments. For instance, using oil instead of animal fat when cooking potatoes, substituting butter with olive oil in the mash, and avoiding honey on the parsnips and carrots are simple modifications. Alternatively, using maple or agave syrup for sweetness is a decent alternative.\n\nVictory for plant-based enthusiasts can be achieved through thorough research and familiarity with supermarkets and online checkouts, allowing a diverse array of options to be available. The main component of the feast, the centerpiece, is heavily dependent on the effort one is willing to invest. Nowadays, several brands provide adequate substitutes for meat. Linda McCartney's new \"roast beef\" joint, infused with a red wine glaze, boasts a convincing beef-like taste, perfect for those craving meat flavors.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n “Travelling,” historian Norman Davies writes near the end of this enthralling book, “had allowed me to think freely about the subject I have spent most of my life studying.” From the journeys described in these pages he has confected a fragrant stew of history, literature and travel spiced with digression, detective work and dabs of humour. A distinguished academic whose many books include the bestselling Europe: A History, Davies’s itinerary “was not dictated by any principle other than keeping on the move in the general direction of the sunrise”. Twelve of the 16 chapters focus on a place – these range from Baku in Azerbaijan, where Asia and Europe overlap, to Cornwall. Four chapters are thematic. Davies’s goal, he said, was roughly akin to that of Goethe’s “school of seeing”: “To test my powers of observation, to spot the recurring themes and catch the fleeting details. And then to tell the story.” His themes include the history, and subsequent marginalisation, of indigenous peoples. The sections on the first inhabitants of Tasmania are particularly gripping. Linguistic revival and language in general fascinate this author, too. He uses Chinese characters and Japanese kanji to illuminate toponyms of those countries and includes a section on Tahitian nature words. There is even a glossary of “Strine”, or Australian English.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  There should be 5 paragraphs.

A distinguished academic whose many books include the bestselling Europe: A History, Davies’s itinerary “was not dictated by any principle other than keeping on the move in the general direction of the sunrise”. Twelve of the 16 chapters focus on a place – these range from Baku in Azerbaijan, where Asia and Europe overlap, to Cornwall. Four chapters are thematic. Davies’s goal, he said, was roughly akin to that of Goethe’s “school of seeing”: “To test my powers of observation, to spot the recurring themes and catch the fleeting details. And then to tell the story.” His themes include the history, and subsequent marginalisation, of indigenous peoples. The sections on the first inhabitants of Tasmania are particularly gripping. Linguistic revival and language in general fascinate this author, too. He uses Chinese characters and Japanese kanji to illuminate toponyms of those countries and includes a section on Tahitian nature words. There is even a glossary of “Strine”, or Australian English.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  There should be 5 paragraphs. Paragraphs and only paragraphs are separated with each other by two new lines as if it was '\\n\\n' in python. Paragraph 5 must start with word wall.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The rather unexpected allusion by the prime minister this week in a speech to the Business Council of Australia to the government’s pursuit of further income tax cuts is not one that should be treated with too much respect until he also talks about how to pay for them. With the return to surplus built on income tax revenue, any income tax cuts are unlikely to come before the next decade without either increases in other taxes or big cuts to government services. Amid the usual “free markets are great” rah-rah that the prime minister doled out to the Business Council of Australia on Monday night, Malcolm Turnbull also slipped in a line on income tax cuts, noting that he was: “Actively working with the treasurer and all my cabinet colleagues to ease the burden on middle-income Australians, while also meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” This was a bit of a surprise given the current state of the budget is such that the government is projecting that a return to surplus only in 2020-21and that net debt at that point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP. Even in the best of times, promising income tax cuts as the budget is in deficit is a courageous position to take for a political party that likes to prides itself on “budget responsibility”.It is even more courageous when the path back to surplus is built on a foundation of income tax revenue. Individual’s income tax has always been the biggest tax in the budget. During the mining-boom years it declined slightly in importance as company tax exploded in value from 3.3% of GDP in 1998-99 to5.3% of GDP in 2005-06. But in the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for just over half of all tax revenue. Now that in itself is a bit of a problem (the IMF and OECD have made calls for Australia to lessen its reliance on income tax) but it is a bigger problem for Turnbull and his call for tax cuts while also “meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” The issue it that of the extra $88.1bn in tax revenue the government hopes to gain between now and 2020-21, $48.5bn of it is to come from individual income tax. This means that income tax is actually bearing a greater burden of the increase in tax than would be expected. Income tax makes up 50.6% of total tax revenue, but accounts for 55% of the increase in tax revenue between now and 2020-21.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

After this introduction, the next paragraph will delve into the core subject, detailing the prime minister's statement, present challenges, and fiscal responsibilities. In the third paragraph, I will address the current fiscal state of Australia, including reliance on income tax and historic tax trends. In the fourth paragraph, the narrative will be dedicated to the projected timeline for achieving surplus, fiscal dilemma, and possible solutions. The final paragraph will conclude with some overarching thoughts and reiterate the core message conveyed.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nTechnology has increasingly become an integral part of our society, permeating different aspects of life, and influencing political discourse. Outside the flurry of recent political discussions on technology, we encounter significant debate over tax policies, specifically focusing on income tax cuts proposed by the current prime minister. The discussion centers around the feasibility of implementing such cuts without jeopardizing the government's commitment to return the budget to surplus.\n\nIn a recent speech delivered to the Business Council of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull hinted at the government's interest in easing the tax burden on middle-income earners. While this could be seen as a welcome move for many citizens, it raises questions regarding its alignment with the projected budget surplus that the government is aiming for. The return to surplus, expected in 2020-21, is largely based on current income tax revenues.\n\nIt's worth noting that individual income tax has been the main revenue contributor for decades, accounting for over half of all tax revenues. The article points out that in previous years when company tax rose significantly, individual income tax took a backseat. However, the current financial year witnesses income tax bearing the brunt of increased taxes, with a projected extra $48.5 billion to be collected by 2020-21. This skewed distribution of tax increases could create a major challenge for the government's pledge to maintain surplus and still reduce individual tax burdens.\n\nOne conceivable strategy includes seeking other tax sources or scaling down government services to match the balanced budget. Despite this, the government might want to reconsider the feasibility and potential ramifications of such measures. The IMF and OECD have previously called for Australia to diversify its tax pool, suggesting that current overreliance on income tax could become problematic.\n\nIn summary, the current government's plan to cut income taxes while balancing the budget poses considerable challenges. While this initiative might be viewed as a reform meant to benefit citizens, careful consideration must be given to how this will affect Australia's tax system in the long run and whether it could compromise the projected return to surplus.\n\n<|end_of_solution|>",

The final paragraph will conclude with some overarching thoughts and reiterate the core message conveyed.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nTechnology has increasingly become an integral part of our society, permeating different aspects of life, and influencing political discourse. Outside the flurry of recent political discussions on technology, we encounter significant debate over tax policies, specifically focusing on income tax cuts proposed by the current prime minister. The discussion centers around the feasibility of implementing such cuts without jeopardizing the government's commitment to return the budget to surplus.\n\nIn a recent speech delivered to the Business Council of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull hinted at the government's interest in easing the tax burden on middle-income earners. While this could be seen as a welcome move for many citizens, it raises questions regarding its alignment with the projected budget surplus that the government is aiming for. The return to surplus, expected in 2020-21, is largely based on current income tax revenues.\n\nIt's worth noting that individual income tax has been the main revenue contributor for decades, accounting for over half of all tax revenues. The article points out that in previous years when company tax rose significantly, individual income tax took a backseat. However, the current financial year witnesses income tax bearing the brunt of increased taxes, with a projected extra $48.5 billion to be collected by 2020-21. This skewed distribution of tax increases could create a major challenge for the government's pledge to maintain surplus and still reduce individual tax burdens.\n\nOne conceivable strategy includes seeking other tax sources or scaling down government services to match the balanced budget. Despite this, the government might want to reconsider the feasibility and potential ramifications of such measures. The IMF and OECD have previously called for Australia to diversify its tax pool, suggesting that current overreliance on income tax could become problematic.\n\nIn summary, the current government's plan to cut income taxes while balancing the budget poses considerable challenges. While this initiative might be viewed as a reform meant to benefit citizens, careful consideration must be given to how this will affect Australia's tax system in the long run and whether it could compromise the projected return to surplus.\n\n<|end_of_solution|>",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Olivia Mead, a millionaire heiress whose list of expenses included a $1.2m crystal-encrusted grand piano and $2,000 annual upkeep of her pet axolotl, has had her inheritance cut from $25m to $6.14m following an appeal from her deceased father’s estate. The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father’s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have “any involvement or association whatsoever” with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than “traditional” Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead’s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court’s master, Craig Sanderson, said would “not fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community”. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright’s estate, acting on behalf of Wright’s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later. On Wednesday, the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court set aside Sanderson’s orders, ruling that while Sanderson was correct to say that Mead had been inadequately provided for in the original will: “The exercise of his discretion to order that provision be made for the respondent in the sum of $25m was flawed.” In a lengthy written judgment, the court found that Sanderson made a number of “material errors” in calculating the size of Mead’s inheritance, saying the focus should have been on what constituted “proper maintenance” and that the initial finding that Mead was “honest” and “not a gold-digger” were not relevant. “The capital sum should be sufficient to enable the respondent to purchase a reasonably substantial house with part of the capital sum and to invest the balance so that she will receive a reasonably substantial annuity for the remainder of her life,” the appeal court’s president, Michael Buss, said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Forget Bennelong or New England, the battle for Australia’s favourite bird is on. As the inaugural bird of the year poll launched on Monday, the nation’s celebrities, political leaders and media outlets immediately began their campaigns. The divisive Australian white ibis leapt to a commanding lead and the powerful owl, with the aid of Russian hackers, rose up the ranks. But in a crowded field of diverse native birds, endorsements rang out for nearly all contenders. The federal opposition leader, Bill Shorten, cut his ties to the magpie, currently coming second, and set his sights on the emu (whose image sits above Parliament House), in what must surely be an early election pitch. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, chose the Gang-gang cockatoo, another Canberra icon (“Incredible plumage but it sounds like a rusty door”), while fellow senator Nick McKim picked the wedge-tailed eagle, and Janet Rice, the hooded plover. Scott Ludlam, 2017’s first dual citizen, again displayed divided loyalties. The former senator endorsed the Carnaby’s black cockatoo at 3.45pm on Monday, but by 8.30pm, he suddenly declared himself “Team Bin Chicken”.

As the inaugural bird of the year poll launched on Monday, the nation’s celebrities, political leaders and media outlets immediately began their campaigns. The divisive Australian white ibis leapt to a commanding lead and the powerful owl, with the aid of Russian hackers, rose up the ranks. But in a crowded field of diverse native birds, endorsements rang out for nearly all contenders. The federal opposition leader, Bill Shorten, cut his ties to the magpie, currently coming second, and set his sights on the emu (whose image sits above Parliament House), in what must surely be an early election pitch. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, chose the Gang-gang cockatoo, another Canberra icon (“Incredible plumage but it sounds like a rusty door”), while fellow senator Nick McKim picked the wedge-tailed eagle, and Janet Rice, the hooded plover. Scott Ludlam, 2017’s first dual citizen, again displayed divided loyalties. The former senator endorsed the Carnaby’s black cockatoo at 3.45pm on Monday, but by 8.30pm, he suddenly declared himself “Team Bin Chicken”. Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, was asked but did not respond, opening himself up to a string of less-than-flattering replies.
