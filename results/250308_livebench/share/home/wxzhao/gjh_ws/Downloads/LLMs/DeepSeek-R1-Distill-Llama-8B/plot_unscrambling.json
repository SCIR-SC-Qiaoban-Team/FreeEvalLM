    "ground_truth":"The first king of Aurea leads a futile attack on a dragon residing in his realm. All the king's men are killed, leaving the king at the Dragon's mercy. Centuries later, Elodie, the adolescent daughter of Lord Bayford, receives a proposal from Queen Isabelle of Aurea to marry her son, Prince Henry. On her father's urging, Elodie agrees to the marriage so her bride price can help their impoverished people. Upon arriving in Aurea, Elodie and Henry are initially uninterested in each other, but begin to bond as they share a desire to travel. Elodie's stepmother, Lady Bayford, becomes suspicious of the motives of Queen Isabelle, leading her to futilely implore Elodie to end the engagement. After the wedding, Elodie and Henry take part in an ancient ritual in the mountains, supposedly to celebrate their union. Isabelle describes the pact between the first king and the Dragon, where he had to sacrifice his three daughters to ensure peace between his people and the dragon. Following a ceremony where their palms are cut and held together, Henry carries Elodie across the narrow path over the Dragon's lair, then at Isabelle's behest throws her down the chasm. Recovering from the fall, Elodie realizes that she is the actual sacrifice. She escapes the Dragon after it burns her leg, and discovers an illuminated cave filled with glowing silk worms, which she collects as a light source. Elodie reaches a chamber with the note 'Safe Here She Cannot Reach', the names of past victims, and a map carved into the wall. In Elodie's sleep, the worms heal the burn on her leg. Elodie follows the map to a dead end at a high vertical drop on the mountainside. She discovers the remains of dead dragon hatchlings, explaining the reason for the royal sacrifices. A rescue party led by Lord Bayford arrives. The Dragon kills them, including Lord Bayford, but the distraction allows Elodie to escape the mountain. She takes one of the rescue party's horses and hides under a rock as the Dragon burns the surrounding area in an unsuccessful pursuit. Alerted by the conflagration that Elodie's sacrifice has failed, Isabelle resorts to kidnapping Elodie's younger sister Floria as a replacement. After learning this from a desperate Lady Bayford, Elodie returns to the mountain to rescue Floria, who the dragon has left alive as bait. Elodie creates a diversion to reach Floria. Telling her sister to hide, she confronts the Dragon and tries to convince her that they were deceived by the Aureans: by joining their cut hands at the wedding, the blood of the brides and the Aurean royals mingled, making the Dragon think of the princesses as being of Aurean descent. Refusing to believe Elodie, the Dragon states that the first king's assault was unprovoked, and then attacks her, but Elodie tricks her into burning herself. With the Dragon at her mercy, she convinces the Dragon of the truth and heals both of them with the glowing worms. Elodie then interrupts the wedding of another sacrifice at the palace, exposing the Aurean royal family's treachery. Elodie advises the new bride and her family to flee, and the Dragon burns the palace with all the Aurean royals and nobles inside. Days later, Elodie, Floria, and Lady Bayford sail home, loaded with supplies and accompanied by the Dragon.",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to help the user by putting together a plot summary from these randomly shuffled sentences. The user provided a list of sentences, and I need to reorder them correctly. First, I'll try to understand the plot from each sentence.\n\nI notice the main character is Elodie, who is involved in a sacrifice plot. The story seems to take place long ago, dealing with a dragon and the royal family. There's conflict between Elodie's family and the Dragon, with imprisonment and betrayal. Elodie discovers some secrets about the past sacrifices and her own role. \n\nI think the timeline is crucial here. I should start with the initial setup, then move into the conflict. Maybe Elodie's actions at the palace, the wedding interruption, and the consequences. Then, the capture and the later escape. It's important to follow the flow of events in the correct order.\n\nI also see that there's a rescue involving Lord Bayford's party, and Floria's role as a replacement sacrifice. The deception and betrayal by Queen Isabelle add layers to the plot. Elodie's journey, the use of the glowing worms, and the final realization of her sacrifice make for a climactic twist.\n\nAdditionally, the epilogue mentions that after the events, Elodie returns home with the dragon, implying a resolution but also a legacy of the past. I need to ensure that this epilogue is placed correctly at the end.\n\nI'll read through the sentences again to see the sequence of actions: Elodie's interruption, the dragon's actions, the rescue attempts, the betrayal, the discovery of the cave, the riddle in the mountain, the ritual, and the realization of her role. \n\nPutting it all together, the plot should start with the initial conflict, Elodie's actions, the consequences, her journey, the reveal, and then the resolution where she understands her role. I'll make sure each sentence flows into the next, maintaining a chronological order.\n",

Refusing to believe Elodie, the Dragon states that the first king's assault was unprovoked, and then attacks her, but Elodie tricks her into burning herself.  \n\nElodie escapes the Dragon after it burns her leg, and discovers an illuminated cave filled with glowing silk worms, which she collects as a light source. With the Dragon at her mercy, she convines the Dragon of the truth and heals both of them with the glowing worms. Alerted by the conflagration that Elodie's sacrifice has failed, Isabelle resorts to kidnapping Elodie's younger sister Floria as a replacement. Elodie then confronts the Dragon and tries to convince her that they were deceived by the Aureans: by joining their cut hands at the wedding, the blood of the brides and the Aurean royals mingled, making the Dragon think of the princesses as being of Aurean descent.  \n\nThe first king of Aurea leads a futile attack on a dragon residing in his realm. Elodie reaches a chamber with the note 'Safe Here She Cannot Reach', the names of past victims, and a map carved into the wall. In Elodie's sleep, the worms heal the burn on her leg. Telling her sister to hide, she confronts the Dragon and tries to convince her that they were deceived by the Aureans: by joining their cut hands at the wedding, the blood of the brides and the Aurean royals mingled, making the Dragon think of the princesses as being of Aurean descent. Elodie's stepmother, Lady Bayford, becomes suspicious of the motives of Queen Isabelle, leading her to futilely implore Elodie to end the engagement.  \n\nAfter learning this from a desperate Lady Bayford, Elodie returns to the mountain to rescue Floria, who the dragon has left alive as bait. A rescue party led by Lord Bayford arrives. Following a ceremony where their palms are cut and held together, Henry carries Elodie across the narrow path over the Dragon's lair, then at Isabelle's behest throws her down the chasm.  \n\nCenturies later, Elodie, the adolescent daughter of Lord Bayford, receives a proposal from Queen Isabelle of Aurea to marry her son, Prince Henry. Upon arriving in Aurea, Elodie and Henry are initially uninterested in each other, but begin to bond as they share a desire to travel. She discovers the remains of dead dragon hatchlings, explaining the reason for the royal sacrifices.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, I need to fix this plot summary. The original summary was all the sentences from the movie shuffled randomly. My task is to reorder them correctly so that they form a coherent and logical plot. Let me start by reading through each sentence and understanding where they fit.\n\nFirst, I see that the plot involves Mea Harper, a defense attorney in Chicago. There's ongoing marital strife because her husband Kal is having an affair, and his mother Azalia is controlling. That's a key point early on to set up her personal struggles.\n\nNext, Mea is approached by Zyair, who claims Ray has a personal grudge against him. This probably happens after she is already involved in some case or knows Ray, so I need to decide the timing of that event.\n\nShe starts to suspect a larger scheme involving Ray and political figures to boost their careers. That might come after she's taken on Zyair's case because she connects his situation to higher corruption.\n\nThen, there's a confrontation that exposes deep corruption and personal vendettas. This should be a turning point where the real villains are revealed.\n\nShe faces threats from external forces aligned with the prosecution and from her own family who protect their interests, protecting maybe Ray's mayoral run. So, this comes when she's deep into the case.\n\nHer relationship with Kal deteriorates as she gets involved, which is probably after she starts working on Zyair's case, leading to their۲۰۰ conflicts.\n\nThere's a family gathering where Ray is prosecuting Zyair. This should come early in her involvement because it sets up the conflict between Mea and Ray.\n\nHer professional interactions with Zyair become personal, challenging her objectivity. This could happen once she's working closely with him, maybe after she takes on his case or during her investigation.\n\nHer investigation reveals inconsistencies in the prosecution's evidence, so she should find that after starting to look into the case, noticing that the evidence isn't solid.\n\nKal's struggles with unemployment and substance abuse come to light, which are personal issues affecting their marriage. This adds another layer to her personal life as she deals with both her career and family.\n\nThe personal stakes rise when she discovers that Kal and Azalia are hiding info about Azalia's health to manipulate her. This is a significant revelation that would test her resolve, so it should come when she's already committed to the case and maybe after some progress.\n\nShe arranges a clandestine meeting with a key witness to blow the case open, which is a pivotal moment towards solving the case. This would happen after she's done some investigation and finds a witness.\n\nZyair claims he was framed, hinting at hidden motives, which adds another layer to the case. This can be part of her investigation, maybe during her meetings or when she's trying to find inconsistencies.\n\nIn the end, there's the family gathering where Ray is prosecuting Zyair. I think this should be the inciting incident that starts the entire plot. So that comes first.\n\nPutting this all together, I think the correct order would start with Mea's personal life struggles in Chicago, followed by her being approached by Zyair, starting to suspect corruption, getting involved, facing family opposition, dealing with her marriage issues, uncovering more corruption, and finally confronting the key witness and dealing with the truth about Kal and Azalia.\n\nI might have some gaps, but I'll arrange them step by step, making sure each sentence logically follows the previous one, setting up the necessary conflicts and character developments.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to piece together this plot summary that's been randomly reordered. The user provided the sentences, and I have to rearrange them in the correct order to form a coherent story. Let me read through each sentence carefully and try to figure out the sequence of events.\n\nStarting with the first sentence: \"As Charlotte cares for Sting, the spider begins to grow at an alarming rate.\" So Charlotte is taking care of this spider, which is growing fast. The next sentence says she \"decides to keep the spider as a pet, naming it Sting.\" That makes sense as the consequence of her caring for it.\n\nThen, \"During a showdown in the building's basement, Sting attacks the group until Charlotte manages to lure it into a trap with the help of Ethan.\" So after the spider is kept as a pet, there's a confrontation where it attacks, and they trap it with Ethan's help. Charlotte's family is safe here, so maybe that's the end of that initial encounter.\n\nNext, \"With Charlotte's family safe, they do not realize that Sting has laid several eggs, with one beginning to hatch.\" So even after the initial trap, the spider reproduces and hatches, leading to more problems.\n\n\"Sting's growing size and insatiable appetite soon lead to the death of pets and residents, which worsen after Charlotte leaves it in the care of her neighbor Eric.\" So as the spider grows, it starts causing destruction. Charlotte hands it off to Eric, which makes things worse because Eric isn't able to handle it.\n\nThen, \"As Charlotte saves Ethan, they face numerous obstacles, including Sting's intelligence and adaptability.\" Here, Charlotte comes back to save Ethan, and they have to deal with the spider's smartness.\n\nThe next part talks about Charlotte's hobbies: she's a fan of comic books and bonds with Ethan over creating a character called 'Fang Girl.' But she feels isolated because of her infant half-brother, Liam. So her introduction of Fang Girl and her family situation come into play.\n\nOne night, she finds a tiny spider from a glowing object in her aunt's apartment. She keeps its size secret but as it grows, others notice strange occurrences. So this introduces the origin of the spider and the building's reactions to it.\n\nCharlotte is a 12-year-old rebel living in a rundown building with her parents, stepfather Ethan, and mother Heather. The tension escalates when the spider, now giant, traps residents using mimicked sounds. They use a trash compactor to destroy it, but with losses.\n\nAfter that, \"Sting attacks and kidnaps both Ethan and Heather along with Liam, forcing a distressed Charlotte to intervene.\" She has to save them, and in doing so, she learns the spider's weakness from her grandmother.\n\nThere's an argument with Ethan when Eric exposes the spider, and this strains their relationship because her biological father is neglecting her. So the family issues come into play, adding emotional depth.\n\nPutting this all together, the sequence seems to go from Charlotte getting the spider, it escaping, causing destruction, leading to the family being taken, Charlotte saving them, and the strained family dynamics. I need to make sure the sentences flow in that chronological order, from the initial encounter with Sting, the growth and destruction, the family being captured, Charlotte intervening, and the resulting family issues. I should also check if any sentences are out of place and ensure the logical flow of events.\n",

With their supply and aid ships constantly sunk by German submarines, Brigadier Colin Gubbins, with the indirect backing of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, prepares to initiate Operation Postmaster, an off the books black-ops sabotage mission intended to disrupt the Nazis' U-boat resupply operation on the Spanish-controlled island Fernando Po. While SOE agents Marjorie Stewart and Richard Heron depart by train, Gubbins enlists Gus March-Phillips to assemble a ground team to destroy the Italian supply ship Duchessa d'Aosta and two tugboats attached to it. Using the neutral Swedish fishing trawler Maid of Honor, Gus and his allies, Graham Hayes, Freddy Alvarez, and Danish naval officer Anders Lassen (the only non-British subject to be awarded the Victoria Cross), begin the slow sail to Fernando Po. Upon discovering that SOE saboteur Geoffrey Appleyard, whom Gubbins had sent ahead on the assumption that Gus would show interest in wanting him on the team, was captured by Gestapo agents, they divert course to a Nazi-controlled section of the Canary Islands for a rescue mission. Meanwhile, arriving early on Fernando Po, Marjorie and Heron use the latter's 'illegal' gambling hall to recruit backup for Gus' team while Marjorie seduces Heinrich Luhr, the SS commander in charge. Upon learning that the Duchessa intends to depart three days ahead of schedule, Gus has his crew sail through a British naval blockade of Nazi-occupied West Africa despite knowing they'll be arrested should their unauthorized mission be discovered. On the night of the intended raid, Marjorie and Heron learn that Luhr has had the Duchessa's hull reinforced despite the Italian attache's reservations. Barely warned of this in time, Gus and Appleyard decide that their best course of action is to hijack the ships and use them as a bartering chip after a mole in Gubbins' staff reveals the mission to senior command. Although Luhr eventually catches on when Marjorie's act begins to 'slip', the raid is ultimately successful, and Marjorie shoots Luhr in the head. Delivering the boats to a British fleet outside Lagos, the team is nonetheless arrested. While waiting to be court-martialed, they are saved and recruited by Churchill as part of his 'Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare', as their actions have not only severely damaged the Nazis' naval strength, but also have allowed the United States, who recently entered the war following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, to join the European theatre. A montage of details before the end credits reveal the post operation activities of several protagonists: Gus became a war hero and would helm several similar raids during the war before marrying Marjorie at the start of her acting career; Appleyard would receive several commendations for his role in the mission, much to the king's amusement; Hayes would go on to become a highly accomplished spy notable for surviving a year of Nazi torture without breaking; Lassen would go on to take part in raids outside the group until his death in 1945; Ian Fleming, who had been part of Gubbins' inner circle during this time, would use Operation Postmaster as the inspirational basis for his James Bond novels.",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I have this plot summary of a movie, but the sentences are all jumbled up. My task is to reorder them correctly. Let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the sentences to get a better grasp of the content. There are quite a few, so I'll go step by step. Each sentence seems to talk about different parts of the story, so I'll need to see where each one fits logically.\n\nThe first sentence mentions Marjorie and Heron learning about Luhr's actions. Since they're the main characters, this probably happens near the beginning. Then, the next sentences talk about Brigadier Gubbins and Operation Postmaster. That seems like the setup or the main mission, so those should come after the initial setup.\n\nThen, there are parts about recruiting backup and using the gambling hall. This likely comes after arriving early on Fernando Po, so the order here matters. After that, Gus and his team using the Maid of Honor ship makes sense as preparation for the mission.\n\nI see a mention of a mole in Gubbins' staff revealing the mission, leading to a change in plans. That would probably come before the actual sabotage. Then, the characters are arrested but later recruited by Churchill. That seems like a turning point, so it should come after the sabotage mission is successful or perceived as such.\n\nThere's a rescue mission for Appleyard, so that would happen after they're arrested and they decide to act. Then, in late 1941, the broader context of the war is set, with details about each character's post-operation life. These montage sentences should probably come towards the end.\n\nLastly, the mission details, including the_blocks Kate arrest and the successful sabotage, should be towards the end. I need to ensure the timeline is accurate, starting with the initial setup, moving through the mission preparation, the mole and changes, the sabotage, arrest, rescue, and then the aftermath.\n\nLet me try to piece this together logically, ensuring that each sentence flows into the next without jumps.\n",

    "ground_truth":"Years after a global catastrophe, Australia is a radioactive wasteland and the Green Place of Many Mothers is one of the last remaining areas with fresh water and agriculture. Raiders discover the Green Place while two kids, Furiosa and Valkyrie, are picking peaches. Furiosa attempts to sabotage their motorbikes, but the raiders capture her as a prize for their leader, warlord Dementus of the Biker Horde. Furiosa's mother Mary pursues them to the Horde's camp, killing all but one raider. The last raider delivers Furiosa to Dementus, but Furiosa mortally wounds him before he can reveal the Green Place's location. Mary sneaks into the camp and rescues Furiosa; the Horde gives chase. Mary stays back to buy Furiosa time to escape and gives her a peach pit to remember her by, but Furiosa returns to her mother anyway. Dementus forces Furiosa to watch her mother's crucifixion. Haunted by the death of his family, he adopts Furiosa as his daughter, hoping that she will lead him to the Green Place. Furiosa tattoos a star chart to the Green Place on her left arm to find her way home. After receiving a tip from a stranded soldier, Dementus and the Biker Horde besiege the Citadel, another Wasteland settlement with fresh water and agriculture. They are repelled by the War Boys, the fanatical army of Citadel warlord Immortan Joe. Dementus changes course, using a Trojan Horse strategy to capture Gastown, an oil refinery that supplies the Citadel with gasoline. At peace negotiations, Joe agrees to recognize Dementus's authority over Gastown and increase its supplies of food and water in exchange for the Horde's physician and Furiosa. At the Citadel, Immortan Joe imprisons Furiosa in the vault with his stable of 'wives'. After Joe's son Rictus shows an attraction to her, she devises a plan to escape. One night, Rictus breaks Furiosa out of the vault to make sexual advances toward her; using a wig made from her own hair, she slips from his grasp and disappears. Disguised as a mute teenage boy, Furiosa works her way up the ranks of Immortan Joe's men for over a decade and helps build the 'War Rig', a heavily-armed supply tanker that can withstand raider attacks in the lawless Wasteland. During one such attack, the Rig's crew are wiped out, leaving its commander, Praetorian Jack, and Furiosa as the only survivors. Furiosa attempts to carjack the Rig and return to the Green Place, but Jack easily thwarts her. However, Jack recognizes her potential and offers to train her to escape the Citadel if she helps him rebuild his crew. Furiosa becomes Jack's second-in-command and is promoted to Praetorian; the two bond and resolve to escape together one day. Immortan Joe decides to attack Gastown, as Dementus's mismanagement has led the facility to near-ruin. He orders Furiosa and Jack to collect weapons and ammunition from the Bullet Farm, an allied mining facility. However, Dementus, having preemptively attacked and captured the Bullet Farm, ambushes the War Rig on arrival; Furiosa and Jack barely escape, and Furiosa's left arm is severely injured. Dementus eventually chases them down and tortures Jack to death. Furiosa escapes her chains by severing her own injured arm, sacrificing her star map to escape; a loner watches Furiosa return to the Citadel. Upon arrival, Furiosa helps Joe plan a 40-day war, during which most of Dementus's horde is killed. Having lost her path home, Furiosa shaves her head again, replaces her arm with a mechanical prosthetic, and pursues Dementus by herself as he flees with the remnants of his horde. After an extended chase, she captures him in the desert. Dementus taunts her, saying revenge will not make her whole. In a voiceover, the potentially unreliable narrator claims that Furiosa imprisoned Dementus at the Citadel and used his living body as fertilizer to grow a peach tree from her mother's seed. For her services, Immortan Joe promotes Furiosa to 'Imperator' and gives her command of a new War Rig. She eventually meets Joe's five remaining wives in the vault where Joe once held her prisoner. In the final scene, the 'Five Wives' hide in Furiosa's War Rig the night before another supply run.",

At the Citadel, Immortan Joe imprisons Furiosa in the vault with his stable of 'wives'. For her services, Immortan Joe promotes Furiosa to 'Imperator' and gives her command of a new War Rig. The last raider delivers Furiosa to Dementus, but Furiosa mortally wounds him before he can reveal the Green Place's location. Furiosa becomes Jack's second-in-command and is promoted to Praetorian; the two bond and resolve to escape together one day. Dementus changes course, using a Trojan Horse strategy to capture Gastown, an oil refinery that supplies the Citadel with gasoline. At peace negotiations, Joe agrees to recognize Dementus's authority over Gastown and increase its supplies of food and water in exchange for the Horde's physician and Furiosa. Immortan Joe decides to attack Gastown, as Dementus's mismanagement has led the facility to near-ruin. Dementus forces Furiosa to watch her mother's crucifixion. Years after a global catastrophe, Australia is a radioactive wasteland and the Green Place of Many Mothers is one of the last remaining areas with fresh water and agriculture. However, Dementus, having preemptively attacked and captured the Bullet Farm, ambushes the War Rig on arrival; Furiosa and Jack barely escape, and Furiosa's left arm is severely injured. After an extended chase, she captures him in the desert. Dementus eventually chases them down and tortures Jack to death. Dementus taunts her, saying revenge will not make her whole. Furiosa attempts to sabotage their motorbikes, but the raiders capture her as a prize for their leader, warlord Dementus of the Biker Horde. After receiving a tip from a stranded soldier, Dementus and the Biker Horde besiege the Citadel, another Wasteland settlement with fresh water and agriculture. They are repelled by the War Boys, the fanatical army of Citadel warlord Immortan Joe. She eventually meets Joe's five remaining wives in the vault where Joe once held her prisoner.

Having lost her path home, Furiosa shaves her head again, replaces her arm with a mechanical prosthetic, and pursues Dementus by herself as he flees with the remnants of his horde. Furiosa escapes her chains by severing her own injured arm, sacrificing her star map to escape; a loner watches Furiosa return to the Citadel.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so the user has given me a query where a plot summary of a movie has had its sentences randomly reordered. My task is to rewrite the plot summary with the sentences correctly ordered, starting with \"PLOT_SUMMARY\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the original plot summary. It's a bit lengthy, so I should go sentence by sentence to figure out where each part belongs. I'll start by identifying the main events in the correct order, even without all the details.\n\nI notice the beginning mentions Joe's son Rictus being attracted to Furiosa, implying she's someone of interest. Then, she's disguised as a mute boy to work her way up in Immortan Joe's men. That's probably the start of her journey. She builds a War Rig, which is crucial, so that should come early.\n\nNext, her mother arrives and kills most raiders. Jack notices her potential and trains her for an escape. So after building the Rig, Mary's arrival and Jack's offer make sense. Then there's a voiceover about Furiosa using Dementus's body for a peach tree, which I think is a bit of an unreliable narrator's claim, maybe from a later perspective.\n\nMoving on, there's an attack on the Bullet Farm where most of the Rig's crew dies, leaving Jack and Furiosa. Jack adopts her as his daughter, hoping she leads him to the Green Place. Rictus later tries to kidnap her, but she escapes using a wig. Then, the five wives are hiding in the Rig before a supply run.\n\nIn the final scenes, she helps Joe plan a 40-day war, killing most of Dementus's Horde. Furiosa is promoted to Imperator and gets a new War Rig. A raider delivers her to Dementus, where she mortally wounds him before he reveals the Green Place's location.\n\nShe becomes Jack's second-in-command and is promoted to Praetorian; they bond and plan to escape. Then Dementus uses a Trojan Horse to capture Gastown, leading to negotiations with Joe. Joe decides to attack Gastown, and Dementus forces Furiosa to watch her mother's crucifixion. \n\nYears later, the wasteland is radioactive, and the Green Place is a safe area. Dementus pre-emptively attacks the Bullet Farm, ambushing the Rig, but Furiosa and Jack escape, with Furiosa injured. She chases Dementus in the desert, captures him, and Jack is tortured, but dies. \n\nDementus taunts her, saying revenge won't heal. She tries to sabotage their bikes, gets captured, and becomes a prize for Dementus. They receive a tip about the Citadel, leading Dementus to besiege it. The War Boys rebel, and Furiosa meets Joe's wives in the vault. Raiders find the Green Place when two kids, Furiosa and Valkyrie, are picking peaches. Furiosa tries to carjack the Rig, but Jack stops her. Mary gives her a peach pit, but Furiosa returns anyway, losing her way home. She shaves her head, gets a prosthetic arm, and chases Dementus alone.\n\nShe escapes by severing her injured arm, sacrificing her star map. A loner watches her return to the Citadel. She tattoos a star chart on her arm to find her way home. Mary rescues her, but the Horde chases them. \n\nNow, putting all this together in the correct order, I can reconstruct the plot summary. Starting from Furiosa's early life, building up the War Rig, her mother's arrival, training with Jack, escape attempts, conflicts with Dementus, her injuries, revenge, and finally her return to the Green Place. Each event flows into the next, so I'll make sure to connect them logically, ensuring the timeline makes sense.\n",
    "filtered_answer":"\n\nPLOT_SUMMARY: After Joe's son Rictus shows an attraction to her, she devises a plan to escape. Disguised as a mute teenage boy, Furiosa works her way up the ranks of Immortan Joe's men for over a decade and helps build the 'War Rig', a heavily-armed supply tanker that can withstand raider attacks in the lawless Wasteland. Furiosa's mother Mary pursues them to the Horde's camp, killing all but one raider. Jack recognizes her potential and offers to train her to escape the Citadel if she helps him rebuild his crew. In a voiceover, the potentially unreliable narrator claims that Furiosa imprisoned Dementus at the Citadel and used his living body as fertilizer to grow a peach tree from her mother's seed. He orders Furiosa and Jack to collect weapons and ammunition from the Bullet Farm, an allied mining facility. During one such attack, the Rig's crew are wiped out, leaving its commander, Praetorian Jack, and Furiosa as the only survivors. Haunted by the death of his family, he adopts Furiosa as his daughter, hoping that she will lead him to the Green Place. One night, Rictus breaks Furiosa out of the vault to make sexual advances toward her; using a wig made from her own hair, she slips from his grasp and disappears.

    "ground_truth":"Following the destruction of House Atreides by House Harkonnen, Princess Irulan, the daughter of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, secretly journals her distaste over how her father betrayed the Atreides. On Arrakis, Stilgar's Fremen troops, including Paul Atreides and his pregnant Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Jessica, overcome a Harkonnen patrol. When Jessica and Paul reach Sietch Tabr, some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the 'Outer World' will bring prosperity to Arrakis. Stilgar tells Jessica that Sietch Tabr's Reverend Mother is dying and that Jessica must succeed her by drinking the Water of Life—a poison fatal for males and untrained women. Jessica transmutes and survives the poison, inheriting the memories of all the past Reverend Mothers. The liquid also prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her; they agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy. Chani and her friend, Shishakli, correctly believe the prophecy was fabricated to manipulate the Fremen, but begins to respect Paul after he declares that he only intends to fight alongside the Fremen, not to rule them. Paul and Chani fall in love as Paul immerses himself in Fremen culture: learning their language, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, riding a sandworm, and raiding Harkonnen spice operations. Paul adopts the Fremen names 'Usul' and 'Muad'Dib'. Due to the continuing spice raids, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen replaces his nephew, Rabban, as Arrakis's ruler with his more cunning yet psychotic younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha. Lady Margot Fenring, a Bene Gesserit, is sent to evaluate Feyd-Rautha as a prospective Kwisatz Haderach and secure his genetic lineage. Jessica travels south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists who believe most strongly in the prophecy. Paul remains in the north, fearful that his visions of an apocalyptic holy war will come to pass if he goes south as a messiah. During another raid on a spice harvester, Paul reunites with Gurney Halleck, who leads Paul to the hidden atomic stockpile of House Atreides. Feyd-Rautha unleashes a devastating attack on the northern Fremen, destroying Sietch Tabr, killing Shishakli, and forcing Paul and the survivors to journey south. Upon arrival, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a coma. This angers Chani, but she is compelled by Jessica to mix her tears with the liquid, which awakens him. Now possessing clairvoyance across space and time, Paul sees an adult Alia on water-filled Arrakis. He also sees a singular path to victory among all possible futures, and that Jessica is the Baron's daughter. Paul meets with the southern Fremen war council, galvanizing the crowd by demonstrating his ability to discern their deepest thoughts. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib and sends a challenge to Shaddam, who arrives on Arrakis with Irulan and the Sardaukar. As Shaddam chastises the Harkonnens for their failures, the Fremen launch an offensive, using atomics and sandworms to overpower the Sardaukar. Paul executes the Baron and captures Shaddam and his entourage. Meanwhile, Gurney leads an assault on Arrakeen where he intercepts and kills a fleeing Rabban. Paul challenges Shaddam for the throne and, to Chani's dismay, demands to marry Irulan. Previously summoned by the Baron, the Great Houses arrive in orbit—Paul threatens to destroy the spice fields with atomics if they intervene. Feyd-Rautha volunteers to be Shaddam's champion, but Paul kills him in a duel. Irulan agrees to Paul's request for marriage on the condition that her father lives. Shaddam surrenders, but the Great Houses reject Paul's ascendancy, so he orders the Fremen to attack the orbiting fleet. As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured Sardaukar ships, Jessica and Alia reflect on the beginning of Paul's holy war. Chani refuses to bow to Paul and departs alone on a sandworm.",

    "response":"\n\n<PLOT_SUMMARY>  \nLady Jessica arrives on Arrakis with her son Paul, escaping the betrayal of House Atreides by House Harkonnen. She guides Paul through his early days on Arrakis, where he faces the harsh desert environment and meets Chani, a young Fremen woman who becomes his companion. Paul quickly learns the ways of the Fremen, adopting their names 'Usul' ('The Tiger') and 'Muad'Dib' ('The Maker of Darkness').  \n\nIn the north, the Fremen of Sietch Tabr, led by Stilgar, prepare for battle against the Harkonnens. The Great Houses, aligned with House Harkonnen, arrive in orbit, threatening to intervene in the conflict. Paul, fearing his apocalyptic visions of a holy war, remains in the north, determined not to become a messiah but to fight alongside the Fremen.  \n\nMeanwhile, Jessica travels south to unite with fundamentalist Fremen who strongly believe in the prophecy of a messiah who will lead Arrakis into prosperity. She is wary of her son's growing influence, but Paul begins to earn their respect through his genuine connection with the Fremen.  \n\nBack in the north, Paul faces increasing pressure as the Great Houses demand his surrender. During a raid on a spice harvester, Paul reunites with Gurney Halleck, who reveals a hidden atomic stockpile belonging to House Atreides. Paul uses this cache to challenge House Harkonnen's ruler, Feyd-Rautha, in a deadly duel. Paul's confidence andุตclassCallCheckาณาจایی gestures win him respect among the Fremen and even Shaddam IV, Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe.  \n\nChani, however, is wary of Paul's growing power. She challenges his demand to marry Irulan, the princess he loves, and departs alone to join the southern Fremen after Paul flees with Chani following the destruction of Sietch Tabr.  \n\nWith Stilgar's forces, Paul and Jessica escape to the south, where Jessica's leadership unites the remaining Fremen against the Harkonnens. Paul is declared the Lisan al Gaib ('The Shape of the West'), a prophesied messiah, and challenges Shaddam for the throne. Shaddam confronts Paul on Arrakis with his Sardaukar, but Paul's visionary powers inspire the Fremen to overcome odds and defeat the Harkonnens.  \n\nAs Paul's victories mount, Jessica undergoes a profound transformation, surviving the poison intended for her by drinking the Water of Life. She gains the memories of all past Reverend Mothers, becoming a powerful leader and guide. Paul, now with Chani, faces new challenges, including the arrival of Feyd-Rautha, who seeks revenge.  \n\nFeyn-Rautha's psychotic actions escalate the conflict, leading to a devastating battle where Paul's resolve and leadership secure the throne for him. However, the Great Houses remain skeptical, forcing Paul to face them alone. With Chani by his side, Paul confronts Shaddam in a final duel, securing his position as ruler of Arrakis.  \n\nThe movie concludes with Paul's growing understanding of his destiny, foreseeing the future and the role of his daughter, Alia, in the coming ages of Arrakis. The legacy of Paul and Jessica's journey reminds the Fremen and the wider universe of the power of love, prophecy, and the hope for a better future.  \n<PLOT_SUMMARY>",
    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to help this user by reordering the plot summary of a movie. But wait, the user hasn't specified which movie this is. That's a bit confusing because there are several movies with similar plot points, like the Dune series. The original question provided a list of sentences that are randomly ordered, and the task is to put them in the correct sequence to form a coherent plot summary starting with PLOT_SUMMARY.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the sentences to get a basic understanding. The plot seems to involve characters like Paul Atreides, Jessica, Chani, various Fremen leaders, and the House Harkonnens. There's a lot about prophecies, spice operations, battles, and political maneuvers.\n\nI notice that the sentences mention events happening in different parts of Arrakis (north and south) and interactions between different houses and factions. There's also a mention of Paul adopting Fremen names, becoming a warrior, and interactions with characters like Gurney Halleck and Feyd-Rautha.\n\nI should probably arrange these sentences in the order of the movie's plot progression. Maybe start with Paul's arrival on Arrakis, his trials, the prophecies, the conflicts with Harkonnens, the radicalization of the Fremen, Paul's growing influence, battles, his final showdown for the throne.\n\nI need to identify key events and the order in which they occur. For example, Paul's initial arrival and encounters with the Fremen, then his time in the south, his acceptance by the Fremen, the prophecies, battles with the Harkonnens, and finally his rise to power.\n\nI should also pay attention to the characters' development and their interactions. Jessica's role as a Reverend Mother, her leadership, Paul's transformation from a noble to a Fremen leader, and the political moves like Shaddam's betrayal and the Great Houses' reactions.\n\nI think it's essential to recognize the turning points, like when Paul drinks the Water of Life, his coma, and the awakening of his abilities. Also, the introduction of antagonists like Feyd-Rautha and his role in the plot.\n\nAdditionally, there are mentions of Lady Margot Fenring evaluating Feyd-Rautha, which likely comes after his rise to power. The escape from the Harkonnens and the journey south, the destruction of Sietch Tabr, Paul's use of divine intervention to inspire the Fremen, and the battle against the orbiting fleet.\n\nThe ending might involve Paul challenging Shaddam, the betrayal by Chani, his defeat, but his escape with Jessica, and the hint of a prophecy fulfilled with Alia.\n\nI need to weave all these elements into a coherent narrative. Let me try to outline the sequence:\n\n1. Introduction: Paul's arrival on Arrakis, his initial struggles.\n2. Meeting key characters: Jessica, Chani, Stilgar.\n3. Initial conflicts with Harkonnens, spice operations.\n4. Prophecy introduction and Jessica's role.\n5. Paul's transformation, adoption of Fremen names, becoming a Fedaykin.\n6. Conflict with House Harkonnen, Rabban's replacement by Feyd-Rautha.\n7. The Great Houses' arrival, Paul's threat to destroy spice fields.\n8. Jessica's journey south, uniting with fundamentalists.\n9. Paul's visions, fear of the apocalyptic war.\n10. Irulan's condition, her father Shaddam's reaction.\n11. The Fremen offensive, using sandworms and atomics.\n12. Shaddam's surrender, Great Houses rejecting Paul, Fremen attacking the fleet.\n13. Paul'sAtomic bomb threat, reunions with Gurney, finding the atomic stockpile.\n14. Duel with Feyd-Rautha, Paul challenging Shaddam for the throne.\n15. Chani's refusal, her departure.\n16. Capture of Shaddam, the Baron's execution.\n17. Paul meeting with Fremen council, showing his abilities.\n18. Jessica's transformation, transmutation, and inheritance of memories.\n19. Destruction of House Atreides, Irulan's journal entry.\n20. Southern Fremen attack on Sietch Tabr, Shishakli's death.\n21. Paul's journey south with Jessica and Alia.\n22. Paul's clairvoyant vision of Alia as an adult, hinting at future events.\n\nI think this outline covers the main plot points. Now, I'll rearrange the provided sentences according to this structure, making sure each key event follows logically from the previous one. I'll group them into sections to ensure continuity and flow.\n",

She challenges his demand to marry Irulan, the princess he loves, and departs alone to join the southern Fremen after Paul flees with Chani following the destruction of Sietch Tabr.  \n\nWith Stilgar's forces, Paul and Jessica escape to the south, where Jessica's leadership unites the remaining Fremen against the Harkonnens. Paul is declared the Lisan al Gaib ('The Shape of the West'), a prophesied messiah, and challenges Shaddam for the throne. Shaddam confronts Paul on Arrakis with his Sardaukar, but Paul's visionary powers inspire the Fremen to overcome odds and defeat the Harkonnens.  \n\nAs Paul's victories mount, Jessica undergoes a profound transformation, surviving the poison intended for her by drinking the Water of Life. She gains the memories of all past Reverend Mothers, becoming a powerful leader and guide. Paul, now with Chani, faces new challenges, including the arrival of Feyd-Rautha, who seeks revenge.  \n\nFeyn-Rautha's psychotic actions escalate the conflict, leading to a devastating battle where Paul's resolve and leadership secure the throne for him. However, the Great Houses remain skeptical, forcing Paul to face them alone. With Chani by his side, Paul confronts Shaddam in a final duel, securing his position as ruler of Arrakis.  \n\nThe movie concludes with Paul's growing understanding of his destiny, foreseeing the future and the role of his daughter, Alia, in the coming ages of Arrakis. The legacy of Paul and Jessica's journey reminds the Fremen and the wider universe of the power of love, prophecy, and the hope for a better future.  \n<PLOT_SUMMARY>",

    "ground_truth":"A civil war has engulfed the United States, fought between the federal government led by a third-term president and secessionist movements. Despite the president claiming that victory is close at hand, it is considered only a matter of time before the 'Western Forces' (WF), led by Texas and California, reach Washington, D.C. After surviving a suicide bombing in New York City, veteran war photographer Lee Smith and journalist colleague Joel meet with their mentor Sammy to share their plan to interview the isolated president. While trying to dissuade them from heading to the capital, Sammy joins them so that he can reach the frontline at Charlottesville, Virginia. The next morning, Lee finds that Joel has allowed a young aspiring photojournalist who Lee encountered at the bombing, Jessie Cullen, to join them. After departing the city, the group stops at a gas station that is protected by armed men. Jessie explores a nearby car wash, where she finds the men torturing two alleged looters. One of the guards follows Jessie, but Lee defuses the situation by taking a photo of the man posing with his victims. Later, Jessie berates herself for being too scared to take photos. When Lee has her shoot a downed helicopter, Jessie asks if Lee would photograph Jessie being killed, to which Lee responds, 'What do you think?'. Following an overnight stop near ongoing fighting, the group documents combat the next day as secessionist militiamen assault a loyalist-held building. Lee recognizes Jessie's potential as a war-photographer and begins to mentor her, while Jessie photographs the militia executing loyalist prisoners. Continuing, the group spends the night at a refugee camp before passing through a small town where, under watchful guard, residents attempt to live in blissful ignorance. Lee and Jessie grow closer, trying on clothes at a shop. They are caught in a sniper battle amid the remains of a Christmas fair. Nearby snipers mock Joel's questioning what side they are on, instead displaying a cynical kill-or-be-killed attitude. Jessie's nerve and photography skills improve as she becomes desensitized to violence. While driving, the four encounter two Hongkonger reporters who they know, Tony and Bohai. Tony and Jessie switch vehicles before Bohai drives ahead with Jessie in his car. The others catch up to find the pair held at gunpoint by unknown uniformed militia who are burying bodies in a mass grave. Against Sammy’s objection, the other three attempt to negotiate their release, but the leader of the militia executes both Bohai and Tony for not being American. The others are saved by Sammy after he rams the group's truck into members of the militia, but he is mortally wounded during the escape and dies. Traumatized, the remaining three arrive at the Charlottesville WF base. Joel learns from Lee's British reporter friend Anya that most remaining loyalists have surrendered, leaving D.C. undefended beside fanatical remnants of the armed forces and Secret Service. Joel drunkenly lashes out at what he views as Sammy's pointless death; Lee tells Jessie that Sammy died while doing what he wanted. Lee deletes a photo that she took of his body. The trio embeds itself with the WF as they assault Washington, D.C., where Jessie repeatedly exposes herself during fighting to capture photographs, while Lee struggles with combat fatigue. After the WF breach the White House's fortified perimeter, the presidential limousine attempts to flee but is quickly intercepted and its occupants (which do not include the president) killed. Understanding it to be a distraction, the trio instead heads inside and is followed by a squad of WF soldiers. Advancing through the largely-abandoned building and against the few remaining Secret Service agents, they shoot a negotiator who is requesting the president's safe passage. Jessie steps into the line of fire while taking photos, as Lee sees imminent danger, intercedes and takes a fatal gun shot; Jessie photographs Lee's death as she pushes Jessie to safety.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user has given me a jumble of sentences from a movie plot and wants me to reorder them correctly. Let's see. The task is to take the provided sentences and arrange them in a coherent sequence that tells a logical story. \n\nFirst, I need to read through all the sentences to understand the overall plot. It's about a group of people, including Lee Smith, a veteran photographer, Joel, and their mentor Sammy. They're dealing with a post-apocalyptic United States where there's a civil war between federal forces and secessionist movements. \n\nI notice that some sentences mention actions at the beginning, like arriving at the Charlottesville WF base after a suicide bombing. Others talk about their plan to interview the president in an isolated area. Then there are scenes where characters interact, like Lee and Jessie growing closer, and some intense combat situations where they face militia groups and soldiers.\n\nI should start by identifying the beginning of the story. The first event mentioned is them arriving at the base, so that should come first. Then they discuss their plan with Sammy. Next, individual actions: Lee and Jessie shopping, Joel stopping delays, Jessie taking photos of soldiers killing the president.\n\nI also see that there are key turning points, like the president claiming victory is near, and then the breach of Washington. There's a scene where the group escapes with Sammy, leading to his death. Later, they deal with other militia groups, find a refugee camp, encounter more friends, and eventually face the final confrontation.\n\nI need to make sure the scene at the car wash, the sniper battle, the negotiation attempt, and the embeddings with WF soldiers are placed in the correct order before moving on to the breach of the White House. \n\nI notice mentions of Lee mentoring Jessie, her improving skills, and some tense moments where Lee almost dies. The ending involves the group escaping to a safe spot, dealing with the aftermath, and reflecting on their losses.\n\nI should piece these together in a way that flows naturally: starting from arrival, planning, initial actions, major combat events, losses, and the final climax where they escape to safety, though with casualties.\n\nI think I've got the main plot points. Now, I'll sort them logically to form a coherent summary.\n",

However, he is severely injured during a stunt gone wrong and he abandons his career and his girlfriend Jody Moreno, a camerawoman. Eighteen months later, Colt, now a valet for a small Mexican restaurant, is contacted by Gail Meyer, Tom's film producer. She tells him that Jody is directing her first film, a science fiction epic titled Metalstorm, and wants Colt to join the production in Sydney. After arriving on set, Colt learns that Jody never asked for him and is still angry about their breakup, with the film being a less-than-subtle attempt at airing her grievances at Colt. Gail reveals that Tom has disappeared after getting into trouble with drug dealers, and she wants Colt to find him before his absence causes the already overbudget film's cancelation. Not wanting Jody's directorial debut ruined, Colt starts to track down Tom. He first goes to Tom's apartment where he is ‘attacked’ by Tom's girlfriend Iggy. She gives him a lead, so he visits a nightclub, where he meets drug dealer Doone, who tricks Colt into drinking a cocktail laced with hallucinogenic drugs. After getting into a fight with the drug dealer's goons, he visits Tom's hotel room where he finds a dead body in a bathtub full of ice. When Colt returns with the police, he finds the body has disappeared. Meanwhile, as production of Metalstorm continues, Colt and Jody begin to rekindle their relationship until Gail abruptly informs him that he must return to the United States. Instead, he continues looking for Tom by tracking down his PA Alma Milan. They are both attacked by people looking for a phone belonging to Tom in Alma's possession. Colt defeats them after an extended chase through Sydney, involving a rubbish truck. He and his longtime friend Dan Tucker, the stunt coordinator on Metalstorm, unlock the phone at Tom's apartment.

Dan escapes, but Colt is captured and brought face-to-face with Tom, who has been hiding out on a yacht on Gail's instructions. He reveals that Gail is framing Colt for the crime using deepfake technology to replace Tom's face with Colt's on the incriminating video. Tom also reveals that he orchestrated both Colt's and Henry's ‘accidents’ over his resentment of them thinking he's cowardly for not wanting to do his own stunts. Henry's body is discovered and the doctored video is released on news media, while Gail tries to convince Jody that Colt is guilty. Colt escapes and is presumed dead after a boat chase, though he swims to safety. The next day, Tom arrives at the Metalstorm set with his goons and the production continues. Colt secretly returns to the set and convinces Jody of his innocence. Together, they trick Tom into participating in a stunt sequence and into confessing while he is wired with a lav mike.

He retrieves the recording and falls onto a crash mat prepared by Dan, while the helicopter crashes with Gail and Tom in it. Metalstorm's trailer premieres at San Diego Comic-Con, with Jason Momoa replacing Tom as the lead, and the film eventually becomes a box-office hit.

He retrieves the recording and falls onto a crash mat prepared by Dan, while the helicopter crashes with Gail and Tom in it. Metalstorm's trailer premieres at San Diego Comic-Con, with Jason Momoa replacing Tom as the lead, and the film eventually becomes a box-office hit. In a flashback, prop crew members dressed as police surround Gail and Tom, prompting Tom to run towards stunt pyrotechnics while trying to phone his agent, accidentally blowing himself up. Meanwhile, as production of Metalstorm continues, Colt and Jody begin to rekindle their relationship until Gail abruptly informs him that he must return to the United States. Instead, he continues looking for Tom by tracking down his PA Alma Milan. Colt Seavers, a Hollywood stunt performer, works as the stunt double for famous action star Tom Ryder. She tells him that Jody is directing her first film, a science fiction epic titled Metalstorm, and wants Colt to join the production in Sydney. Henry's body is discovered and the doctored video is released on news media, while Gail tries to convince Jody that Colt is guilty. She gives him a lead, so he visits a nightclub, where he meets drug dealer Doone, who tricks Colt into drinking a cocktail laced with hallucinogenic drugs. Colt defeats them after an extended chase through Sydney, involving a rubbish truck. The next day, Tom arrives at the Metalstorm set with his goons and the production continues. They are both attacked by people looking for a phone belonging to Tom in Alma's possession. However, he is severely injured during a stunt gone wrong and he abandons his career and his girlfriend Jody Moreno, a camerawoman.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so I've got this query where I need to help reorder a plot summary from a movie. The user provided a bunch of sentences that are supposed to be part of the plot but are randomly ordered. My task is to rewrite the summary with the sentences in the correct order, starting with <PLOT_SUMMARY>.\n\nFirst, I need to read through all the sentences and understand the flow of the story. It seems like it's an action movie, possibly involving stuntmen, productions gone wrong, and some mystery or conspiracy. The main characters include Colt, Dan, Tom, Gail, Jody, and possibly others like Doone and Alma.\n\nLooking at the first few sentences, I can see that Colt is a valet 18 months after the incident, so maybe that's a later part of the summary. Then there's a premiere, which probably comes after the events leading up to it. There are mentions of Tom's accident, so that likely happens after the production has started.\n\nI notice that some sentences mention Gail Meyer, a film producer, and that she's involving Tom. Then there's a flashback of Tom running and blowing up, which probably sets up some of the plot dynamics. Production of Metalstorm is ongoing, so Jody is directing, and Colt is being asked to join, which might be a later point after reconciling with Jody.\n\nThere are sequences where Henry's body is found, and a video is released, which sounds like a major plot point where things escalate. Gail framing Colt using deepfake tech is a twist, so that likely comes after Henry's death.\n\nColt tracking down Tom, meeting Doone, and the extended chase through Sydney are probably middle sections, leading into the beginning of the conflict with Tom and Gail.\n\nThen, Tom getting injured, abandoning Jody, and Colt trying to find him again. There's a video showing Tom killing Henry, which is a crucial piece of evidence. The confrontation with the drug dealer's goons, and finding a dead body in Tom's hotel room add more layers to the mystery.\n\nColt gets exonerated, and his relationship with Jody starts to deteriorate because of the film. Escaping and being presumed dead, then rescuing Gail and Tom's yacht, and getting back to the set, where he confronts Jody and Tom's goons. The resolution involves tricking Tom into confessing with a recording.\n\nPutting all these together, I can see that the story starts with Colt's life after the incident, moves into the production of Metalstorm, the uncovering of the conspiracy against him, his quest to find Tom, the varied subplots with Jody and Gail, and finally, the climax where Tom's guilt is revealed, and the resolution.\n\nI need to ensure the sentences are ordered chronologically. So starting from the beginning, Colt is a valet. Then he's contacted by Gail. Retrieval of the recording, the helicopter crash. Then Metalstorm's premiere, with Jason Momoa replacing Tom. That seems like an event after the main plot starts.\n\nThere's a flashback of Tom blowing up, which probably happened earlier, setting up Tom's character. Then production moves forward with Jody directing and Colt being approached by Alma to join. Working as Tom's stunt double, he discovers Jody's involvement, which might be later.\n\nDoone tricking Colt into drinking drugs, leading to a chase—that should come after he starts looking for Tom. Then Tom arrives on the set, causing more chaos. The fight over the phone, Tom's injury, and his abandonment of Jody. Then Colt and Jody try to find Tom, but Jody is still angry, leading to the film being a mess.\n\nColt's fight with the goons, finding the body, and getting exonerated. Jody is still upset, but he manages to escape and is presumed dead. He comes back, Gail and Tom are involved, but Gail is framing Colt. She tries to escape with Tom in a helicopter, but Jody helps Colt, allowing him to get back.\n\nColt then goes to the set, reconciles with Jody, but the body is gone. They trick Tom into confessing by wiring him. Finally, they find the phone, which has some crucial evidence, leading to the resolution.\n\nI think the key is to start from the earliest events in Colt's life after the initial incident, then move into Gail's involvement, the production of Metalstorm, the clues about the deepfake, the chases, the reveals of Tom's guilt, and finally the climax where everything comes out. Ensuring that each sentence flows into the next in the correct timeline is essential for the summary to make sense.\n",

    "ground_truth":"Captain Eddie ‘Reaper’ Grimm, a US Air Force drone pilot, supported by Staff Sergeant Nia Branson, provides air support from a Reaper to a US Army Delta Force team sent to rescue a CIA spy in the southern Philippines. After a firefight breaks out against the Abu Sayyaf, Sergeant JJ ‘Playboy’ Kinney – a young Air Force TACP officer attached to the drone team as its JTAC – is seemingly the only survivor and is directed to an extraction point, relying only on the Reaper's remote air support. Once Kinney arrives, he is intercepted by the Abu Sayyaf, depleting the ammunition of Grimm's drone (consisting of AGM-114 Hellfire and BLU-118 rockets) and forcing the endangered extraction helicopter to leave. Trying to reach another extraction point, Kinney falls down a hill and loses his rifle, runs out of ammunition for his pistol, and then gets captured. One of his squad mates, Master Sergeant John ‘Sugar’ Sweet, turns out to be alive and rescues Kinney, while telling him Sergeant Bishop was taken prisoner in Abu Sayyaf's base in a series of caves, at their initial mission location. Using Sweet's radio, Kinney contacts Grimm, who schedules three bombings to hit the base, each 15 minutes apart, before Grimm and Branson are forced by their superiors to take a leave for having exceeded their shift. Kinney and Sweet raid one of Sayyaf's facilities before being captured and taken to their prison. Sweet is executed right as the first superficial bombing hits, and Kinney is taken to be tortured, where the rebel leader does not believe his warning about the upcoming bombings. When the bombs hit, Kinney survives due to having been dunked in a water tub, while his captors are caught in the flames. Kinney grabs a machete and kills the surviving leader, taking his satellite phone and calling Nellis Air Force Base for Grimm to call off the third bombing, before the battery runs out. The base crew, distracted by a March Madness game, dismisses Kinney's call and redirects him to Grimm's private phone. Grimm does not answer, being in a call with his very pregnant wife while grocery shopping, so Kinney leaves a voice mail, and leaves seeking the other prisoners. Returning to Bishop and searching for a way out, they also find the CIA operative, whom Grimm and Branson had been lied to that he was found elsewhere by another agency's operation. At the grocery store checkout, Grimm hears Kinney's voicemail and immediately leaves, trying to call Nellis while driving to the base. As no one answers, Grimm is forced to rush to the control room and order the B-1 Lancer pilot to abort the bombing, right as it flies in front of Kinney, Bishop, and the CIA agent reaching the cave's entrance. As the soldiers are finally extracted in the Philippines, Grimm complains to the rest of the base crew and his superiors that three men nearly died because they were too distracted to hear their calls, despite being repeatedly asked to pay attention to the phone because of his pregnant wife, and he smashes the break room's main television in anger.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I have this query where someone has a plot summary of a movie mixed up with sentences randomly reordered. They want me to fix the order so it makes sense. Hmm, let me read through the given information carefully.\n\nThe first sentence is about Master Sergeant John 'Sugar' Sweet rescuing Kinney and informing him about Sergeant Bishop being captured. It seems like a turning point in the plot, so maybe this should come early on. Then, there's a firefight against Abu Sayyaf where Kinney is the only survivor. That should follow after the initial mission where Bishop was captured.\n\nNext, Kinney is directed to an extraction point with the Reaper's help. After that, Grimm hears Kinney's voice mail at the grocery store. That probably comes after the initial incident but before the events where they are captured. I think these events are sequential, so I should arrange them in order.\n\nThen, there's Grimm and Branson providing air support. That should happen after Kinney is captured. The plotting of the bombings and Grimm being forced to leave is probably after this support mission. His neglecting the calls because of his leave might cause the conflict, leading to the near-death situation.\n\nWhen the bombs hit, there's a close call with Kinney surviving. After that, he's captured again and escapes with Bishop and the CIA agent. Then, Grimm and Branson have a emotional moment, which fits towards the end when they can finally focus on their personal issues.\n\nFinally, Kinney kills the leader and calls off the bombing, leading to the extraction. The soldiers are saved, but Kinney gets recaptured. Grimm's outburst at base comes next, followed by Kinney's attempt to escape but failing. \n\nPutting it all together, I think I should order the sentences from the initial mission, the capture, Grimm's air support, the bombings, the near-death, the escape, Grimm's emotional moment, Kitnney's final capture, and finally the aftermath with Grimm's frustration and the soldiers being extracted.\n\nI need to make sure each event flows into the next without repeating information and that the timeline is accurate. Let me check each part again to ensure I'm not missing any crucial connections. Also, I should start each paragraph with the correct setting, like the mission, then the follow-up events, and so on.\n\nWait, there's a mention of Grimm being in a call with his wife while grocery shopping and not answering Kinney's voice mail. That should come before he's forced to take leave but after the extraction point is set up. \n\nI think I've got a rough structure. Let me piece it together step by step to reconstruct the plot correctly.\n",

Kinney grabs a machete and kills the surviving leader, taking his satellite phone and calling Nellis Air Force Base for Grimm to call off the third bombing, before the battery runs out.  \n\nAs the soldiers are finally extracted in the Philippines, Grimm complains to the rest of the base crew and his superiors that three men nearly died because they were too distracted to hear their calls, despite being repeatedly asked to pay attention to the phone because of his pregnant wife, and he smashes the break room's main television in anger.  \n\nTrying to reach another extraction point, Kinney falls down a hill and loses his rifle, runs out of ammunition for his pistol, and then gets captured.  \n<\/PLOT_SUMMARY>",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I've got this plot summary of a movie, but the sentences are all jumbled up. My task is to figure out the correct order of these sentences to piece together the plot properly. Let me read through each sentence carefully and try to figure out where each one fits best.\n\nThe first sentence is: \"Czech astronaut Jakub Procházka is six months into a space mission to investigate a mysterious cloud of dust and particles, called Chopra, lying beyond Jupiter.\" That sounds like the opening scene, introducing Jakub and his mission. So that should probably go first.\n\nNext, it says: \"Jakub struggles with loneliness and misses his wife, Lenka, who has recently stopped talking with him after he left her and their unborn daughter behind to go on the mission.\" This provides background on Jakub's personal issues, so this should come right after the first part.\n\nThen, there's: \"Jakub and Lenka talk again, coming to terms with their relationship.\" This is a turning point in their relationship, so maybe this comes after the initial struggle. How long after? Probably after the initial problem is presented.\n\nLooking at the next sentence: \"Exploring his memories, Hanuš learns more about Jakub: his father was an informant of the state party and was killed when Jakub was young.\" I think Hanuš is a creature or a robot or some sort of companion. So this should come after Jakub starts having interactions with Hanuš.\n\n\"Wait, let me see. So Jakub meets Hanuš, and through Hanuš's exploration of his memories, we learn about Jakub's past. So perhaps that comes a bit later in the story, after the initial meeting with Hanuš.\"\n\nMoving on: \"The creature, whom Jakub names Hanuš, wishes to understand humans better and to help Jakub with his loneliness.\" That makes sense as Hanuš's motivation, so probably after Jakub meets him.\n\nNext sentence: \"Hanuš leaves to die in space, but Jakub goes after him.\" This is a critical moment where Hanuš sacrifices himself, so that should come after they meet and Hanuš decides to help Jakub.\n\nThen, \"The Czech mission has arrived shortly before a competing South Korean mission.\" That's about the setting and the competition, so it should be placed after the mission is underway but before any conflict arises.\n\n\"Hanuš returns after this, revealing that he's dying due to a parasitic infection that wiped out his entire species.\" So Hanuš comes back to the ship, dies, which happens after the competition event. So that's next after the arrival.\n\n\"Lenka sends him a message telling him that she wants to leave him, but Commissioner Tuma, Jakub's commanding officer, prevents it from reaching him, to prevent Jakub's mental state from worsening.\" This is about the conflict between Lenka wanting to leave and Tuma's intervention. This should come after Hanuš's death and his interactions.\n\n\"After showing Jakub an implanted memory of the miscarriage, which Jakub was not present for, Hanuš, disappointed with humanity, leaves the ship, leaving Jakub distressed.\" Here, Hanuš imprints a memory, so this should follow the message from Lenka.\n\n\"Hanuš passes away due to the infection.\" So this is after he leaves the ship and is unable to help Jakub anymore.\n\n\"The two finally arrive at the Chopra cloud, which is revealed to be a leftover of the beginning of the universe and where every moment of time exists simultaneously.\" This is the climax of the mission, so it comes after all the personal stuff with Hanús.\n\n\"Jakub arranges with Peter, a technician and good friend of his, to deliver a message to Lenka, asking for forgiveness for his neglect.\" This is Jakub's effort to make things right, so it should come after arriving at Chopra.\n\n\"She appears to him in a forest scene as a rusalka.\" This is a spectral appearance, so this should follow the message delivery.\n\n\"Days later, still without news from Lenka, Jakub finds a spider-like creature with telepathic abilities inside a compartment of the ship.\" This is a continuation of Jakub's journey, so it comes after the forest scene.\n\n\"Within the cloud, Jakub comes to the conclusion that he wishes only to be with his wife.\" This major realization happens while at Chopra.\n\n\"Jakub is picked up by the South Korean space vessel.\" That's the end of his mission, so that's last.\n\n\"He met Lenka, but often neglected her, being more focused on his career as a cosmonaut, going as far as leaving her when she suffered a miscarriage.\" This is backstory, showing his past actions, probably early on in the story but after the initial setup.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some connections. Let me try to piece them in order step by step.\n\n1. Introduction: Jakub is on the mission. Czech mission to Chopra.\n2. Jakub's loneliness, missing Lenka.\n3. He and Lenka reconcile (talk again).\n4. Hanuš learns about Jakub's past by exploring his memories.\n5. Hanuš's motivation: wants to understand humans, help Jakub.\n6. Hanuš leaves to die but Jakub goes after him.\n7. Czech mission arrives, South Korean mission is competing.\n8. Hanuš returns, reveals he's dying from infection.\n9. Lenka sends a message to leave, Tuma stops it.\n10. Hanús shows Jakub an implanted memory of miscarriage, disappointed with humanity, leaves, Jakub distressed.\n11. Hanuš dies due to infection.\n12. Mission continues to Chopra.\n13. Arrive at Chopra, it's the start of the universe.\n14. Jakub asks Peter to deliver a message to Lenka.\n15. Lenka appears as a rusalka.\n16. Days later, finds a spider-like creature with telepathic abilities.\n17. Within Chopra, Jakub decides he wants to be with his wife.\n18. Jakub is picked up by South Korean vessel.\n19. Backstory: Jakub met Lenka, neglected her, left her after miscarriage.\n\nI think the only thing is that the backstory (Jakub meeting Lenka and neglecting her) should probably come after the initial mission setup but before his personal issues or interactions with Hanús. Wait, but the way the sentences are given, the backstory is at the end, so maybe it's at the very end when he's being picked up by the South Korean ship. Alternatively, perhaps the backstory is part of the initial setup.\n\nWait, in the original plot, after he's picked up by the South Korean ship, the story goes back to his past with Lenka. So maybe the backstory should come after the events at Chopra. Let me check.\n\nIn the original summary, after arriving at Chopra and dealing with the spider creature, Jakub is picked up by the South Korean ship, and then he meets Lenka, recounting his past actions. So the backstory should come after the mission, when he's on the South Korean ship.\n\nSo, I think I have to reorder the sentences accordingly. Let me list them with the sequence I think they should go.\n\n1. Czech mission, six months into it, looking into Chopra.\n2. Jakub's loneliness, missing Lenka.\n3. Talk again, reconcile.\n4. Exploring memories, Hanús learns about Jakub's past.\n5. Hanús wants to help, decide to leave, Jakub goes after.\n6. Czech mission arrives, South Korean mission is competing.\n7. Hanús returns, dies from infection.\n8. Lenka sends message, Tuma stops it.\n9. Hanús shows memory, disappointed, leaves, Jakub distressed.\n10. Hanús dies.\n11. Arrive at Chopra.\n12. Deliver message to Lenka via Peter.\n13. Lenka appears as rusalka.\n14. Days later, find creature with telepathic abilities.\n15. Decide to be with wife.\n16. Picked up by South Korean ship.\n17. Backstory: met Lenka, neglected her, left her after miscarriage.\n",

One night, Bea goes out to buy a charger for her mother's old camcorder and sees an unfamiliar creature, following it back to her grandmother's building. The next day, she sees the creature again, accompanied by a man. Bea follows them to a nearby house where the man, Cal, retrieves a large furry purple creature named Blue. She also meets the other creature, a butterfly-like being named Blossom, and faints.

Initially reluctant, Bea eventually decides to help Cal. The next day, Cal takes Bea to Memory Lane Retirement Home, a retirement community for IFs housed underneath a swing in Coney Island. There, he introduces Bea to Lewis, an elderly teddy bear who is the head of the facility. He inspires Bea to use her imagination to redesign the facility, much to the chagrin of Cal. Bea tries to match one of the IFs with Benjamin, a young patient at the hospital. She, Cal, and Lewis audition the IFs, but he is unable to see any of them. Feeling unmotivated, Bea talks with Lewis on the Coney Island pier. He gives her an idea that maybe IFs do not need new kids, but rather to reunite with their old ones. Talking with her grandmother, she sees a picture of her as a young dancer and recognizes Blossom in the background of the picture. Realizing Blossom was her grandmother's IF, Bea decides to test Lewis' idea. Playing one of her grandmother's records inspires Margaret to dance and she remembers Blossom, instilling Bea with hope.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, I need to help the user by rewriting a randomly reordered plot summary of a movie. The user has provided a bunch of sentences that are out of order and wants them correctly sequenced into a coherent plot summary, starting with \"<PLOT_SUMMARY>\".\n\nFirst, I should read through all the sentences to understand the story. I'll look for key points and try to figure out the chronological order. Starting with the beginning, I remember Bea moving into her grandmother's apartment while her dad is in the hospital. So the initial part should set up her situation.\n\nNext, I think she meets some creatures named IFs. There's a dragon, Benjamin, and a butterfly-like Blossom. The landlady shows her the storage room where everything starts. She faints upon seeing Blossom, so that scene should come early on.\n\nThen, she goes back to see Cal and tells him a story about her mom dying. This seems important for her character development. After that, Cal explains about the IFs and their purpose, which she initially doesn't want to believe but later helps him with.\n\nI notice she has some interactions with Lewis, the teddy bear head. They audition IFs, but Calvin can't see them, leading to an idea that IFs might reunite with old kids. That probably comes after she helps identify some stories.\n\nShe tries to help with the IFs but struggles with Calvin's antics. There's a part where she sees Blossom in her grandmother's picture, which is a key moment that gives her hope. Then, her dad recovers, they go home, and she deals with an invisible Keith.\n\nFinally, there's a resolution where they reunite IFs with their original kids, like Blue's Jeremy, which seems like the climax. The story ends with her grandmother going back to the hospital, leaving the future uncertain.\n\nI need to make sure each sentence fits smoothly into the flow. I'll start with setting the scene of her move, then the discovery of the storage room and the IFs, their interactions, the hospital scenes, her helping with the IFs, the resolution with Jeremy, and the hopeful ending with Blossom’s presence.\n\nI should also check if any sentences are out of place. For example, the part where she buys a charger and meets Lewis might fit after she starts helping Cal. The auditioning of IFs seems to come after she's learned about them and is trying to help.\n\nOverall, I'll structure the plot summary by following the main events in the order they logically occur, ensuring each sentence connects well to the next. I'll make sure to include all the key moments like her mother's death, meeting IFs, helping reunite them, and the emotional discovery about Blossom.\n\nOnce I have the order, I'll write the summary, ensuring it starts correctly and flows naturally. I'll double-check to make sure no important details are missed and that the story is told in a coherent sequence.\n",

    "ground_truth":"In 1976, amidst armed political conflict that is affecting daily life in Jamaica, Bob Marley announces he will perform at a concert, Smile Jamaica, promoting peace amongst the warring factions. While preparing for the concert, Marley, his wife Rita, and several other members of his band are shot by assailants. Rita and Marley are hospitalized, but survive and recover from their injuries in time for the concert. After performing, Marley, saddened that his own countrymen would try to kill him and his wife, shows the crowd his bullet wounds before walking off stage. He tells Rita to take their children to Delaware in the United States and stay with his mom, as he and the rest of his band venture to London. After struggling to come up with a new album concept, Marley asks Rita to rejoin him and the band in England, and taking inspiration from the soundtrack of the film Exodus and their own situation, he and the band begin recording what would become their album of the same name. The album becomes a hit and helps further popularize reggae music and the Rastafari movement around the world. When the recording company schedules a tour in Europe, Marley also aims for stops throughout Africa to inspire the people there. This leads to friction with Rita as she and Marley argue about his responsibilities and both his and Rita's infidelities, in addition to having given up on promoting peace back in Jamaica. Marley also gets into an altercation with manager Don Taylor over a financial dispute. After a toenail infection raises concern from Rita and his record producer Chris Blackwell, Marley is later diagnosed with a rare skin cancer. Blackwell confronts Marley about treatment choices, reluctantly dismissed by a firm Marley. Faced with his own mortality, Marley reconciles with Rita and Taylor and finally decides to return to Jamaica in 1978, where he is welcomed back by a crowd at the airport. Back home, the gunman who had shot him and the others arrives and begs for forgiveness, to which Marley states he ‘keeps no vengeance’. After Marley debuts a song to Rita and the children about reconciliation, she finally deems him ready to perform a peace concert. The film ends as Marley and his band gear up to perform again for the Jamaican crowd with the song ‘One Love’.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, I've got this query where the user provided a plot summary of a movie, but the sentences are jumbled. My task is to rearrange them correctly and start with PLOT_SUMMARY. Let me try to breakdown what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of a typical plot summary. Usually, it starts with the beginning, leads through the middle, and ends with the climax and resolution. So, I'll look for sentence fragments that fit each part.\n\nLooking at the sentences, the last part talks about the album becoming a hit and promoting reggae music. That's likely the end, so I'll place that last. Next, I see mentions of performing again, which probably comes after some events. There's also a point where Marley is dealing with a gunman seeking forgiveness, so that might be in the middle, perhaps after his health issues.\n\nI notice that after the peace concert, Marley's health problems start with a toenail infection leading to skin cancer. That must come after his concert but before the conflict with his manager Don Taylor. So, I'll order those sentences accordingly.\n\nThere's a mention of an album concept and recording in England, so that's likely during the middle when they're working on music despite challenges. Arguments between Marley and Rita about responsibilities and infidelity would come after the recording starts, so that's a later middle part.\n\nThe pre-credits montage shows a concert with political figures and a performance in Zimbabwe. That should be near the beginning because it's a significant event that sets the stage for the rest of the plot.\n\nI also see the 1976 Smile Jamaica concert, which I think is the main event where the conflict arises. So, after the montage, Marley announces this concert in 1976, which is a turning point. That should come after his return to Jamaica and his health issues, maybe? Wait, no, 1976 comes after 1978 in theichten? Hmm, actually, no. Wait, the Smile Jamaica concert is in 1976, and then the album is after that. Let me double-check the timeline.\n\nWait, the last part mentions the album becoming a hit in the 1970s, so 1976 would be before 1978. So, after the pre-credits montage, the next event is Marley announcing the Smile Jamaica concert in 1976. Then, dealing with his health issues, the argument with his manager, the shooting, the album recording, etc.\n\nLet me map this out:\n\n1. Film begins with a pre-credits montage showing Marley's real-life peace concert, then moves to his death in 1981.\n\n2. Back in the storyline, Marley is dealing with financial disputes with Don Taylor.\n\n3. Health problems arise with the toenail infection and skin cancer diagnosis.\n\n4. The gunman seeks forgiveness after shooting Marley and others.\n\n5. Marley tells Rita to take the kids to Delaware while he goes to London.\n\n6. In 1976, amidst Jamaica's political conflict, Marley announces the Smile Jamaica concert, promoting peace.\n\n7. Marley argues with Chris Blackwell about treatment and dismisses his advice.\n\n8. Preparing for the concert, they are shot, then Marley goes to England with Rita and the band after seeking inspiration from Exodus.\n\n9. Recording the album leads to friction with Rita, then scheduling a tour including Africa.\n\n10. Faced with mortality, Marley reconciles, returns to Jamaica in 1978, survives the hospitalization, and the album is released, becoming a hit and promoting reggae.\n\nI think that's the correct order. Now, I'll piece the sentences together in that sequence, starting with PLOT_SUMMARY and ensuring the flow makes sense.\n",

After the group captures a ghost in Hell's Kitchen, Walter Peck, the Ghostbusters' long-time opponent, threatens to close them down with his authority as mayor. To appease him, Callie removes underage Phoebe from the team. Upset, Phoebe attempts to control her emotions by playing chess in a nearby park, where she encounters and befriends Melody, the ghost of a teenage girl who died in a fire.

Ray suspects it is an apotropaic trap. When he tests its PKE levels, the orb immediately emits broad-spectrum telekinetic energy. A frosty wave travels from the orb to the Ghostbusters' firehouse headquarters and damages the ecto-containment unit, which is dangerously near capacity. Winston takes the orb to his privately owned paranormal research center, run by Dr. Lars Pinfield.

Peter Venkman, brought in to help, discovers Nadeem has latent pyrokinetic powers. Meanwhile, Ray, accompanied by Phoebe and Podcast, visits Dr. Hubert Wartzki, a New York Public Library research librarian. Wartzki explains the orb was built millennia ago by four sorcerers called the Firemasters to imprison Garraka, a phantom god who sought to conquer the world with an undead army who would use ‘Kusharit Umoti’ - ‘the power to kill by fear itself.’ They learn Nadeem's grandmother belonged to the lineage of Firemasters, one of whom prevented Garraka from escaping the orb in 1904 during a mock ritual conducted by members of the Manhattan Adventurers' Society, whom Garraka froze to death. Garraka was confined in the orb due to being vulnerable to copper alloys combined with fire and lacking his devil horns which augment his powers. When the trio attempt to stop a ghost from stealing a phonographic recording of the club's ritual, Peck exploits Phoebe's involvement to shut down the Ghostbusters. After an argument with Gary and her mother, Phoebe runs away and takes Melody to Winston's research center.

Melody reveals she had been secretly working with Garraka, who has offered her passage to the afterlife.

Realizing Garraka will free the ghosts in the containment unit, the Ghostbusters gather to defend their headquarters, aided by Nadeem, who dons the Firemaster brass armor kept by his grandmother and attempts to master his powers.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I've been given this task to reorder a plot summary of a movie. The user provided a bunch of sentences that were randomly shuffled. My job is to figure out the correct order and present it as a coherent plot summary. Let's see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll read through all the sentences to get a sense of the overall story. I notice it's about the Ghostbusters, which is a familiar concept, so that helps. There are mentions of phenomena like ecto-containment units, a ghost named Garraka, and characters like Phoebe, Melody, and Nadeem. There's also a mayor, Walter Peck, who seems to be a recurring antagonist.\n\nI'll start by identifying key plot points. For example, the beginning mentions Wartzki explaining the orb's origin, which is a primary setup. Then, a ghost in Hell's Kitchen leads to the team being threatened by Peck, who wants to shut them down. Then there's a breach and some character developments, like Phoebe leaving and returning, and Nadeem getting involved with the orb.\n\nI should look for transitions between scenes. For example, after the capture of the ghost in Hell's Kitchen, Peck threatens them. Then, Garraka breaches containment, which leads to more conflict. After that, there's a scene where Phoebe argues with Gary and runs away, taking Melody to Winston's center. That seems like a natural progression.\n\nI also notice a scene where Callie removes Phoebe from the team, which would naturally follow the argument. Then Phoebe does something to strengthen her proton pack, and Melody helps Nadeem. So the sequence goes from the argument, Phoebe leaving, to her modifying her gear and working with Melody and Nadeem.\n\nThere's also a mention of the Firemasters, which ties back to the orb's origins. Nadeem's grandmother is involved, which implies a legacy or background that will play a role later. The Frosty wave damaging the containment unit is a critical moment that raises the stakes.\n\nThen, the Ghostbusters gather to defend their headquarters, and Nadeem dons his grandmother's armor. This would come after they realize the threat Garraka poses and during the attack on their base. Nadeem selling the orb to them is another key point that probably comes before the orb's effects start manifesting.\n\nWinston taking the orb to his research center is next, followed by Phoebe playing chess and meeting Melody, who helps her reconcile with Phoebe. This seems to be a lighter moment before things escalate, as Melody's betrayal by Garraka is mentioned, indicating things might get more complicated.\n\nPeter Venkman's arrival to help, discovering Nadeem's powers, and using Phoebe's spirit are part of the climax where they trap Garraka. Then, the mid-credits scene with the trucker and the Mini-Pufts is a typical setup for an aftermath or teaser.\n\nLater, the city thaws and the Ghostbusters are hailed as heroes, with Peck supporting them again. Meanwhile, Ray and Podcast are collecting cursed objects. Melody's secret cooperation with Garraka adds a twist, showing she's had a role in the events, and the ending shows the relocation to New York City, setting the stage for future operations.\n\nThroughout this, I need to ensure the timeline makes sense. For example, after the initial threat, the team relocates to New York, which would come after the events in the mid-credits scene. Also, the use of the orb causing a Frosty wave affects the containment unit, leading to the need to gather and defend.\n\nI might have missed some transitions, but overall, starting from the orb's origins, moving through initial captures, conflicts with Peck, breaches, character developments, and then the climax with the orb's power and the resolution, and the aftermath with the team re establishing themselves in New York seems to fit.\n\nI think I've got the order. Now, I'll outline the plot points in the correct sequence and write the summary accordingly.\n",

    "ground_truth":"Many generations after Caesar's death, apes have established numerous clans, while most humans have become feral-esque. Noa, a young chimpanzee from a falconry-practicing clan, prepares for a coming-of-age ceremony by collecting eagle eggs with his friends Anaya and Soona. However, a human scavenger follows Noa home and inadvertently cracks his egg during a scuffle before fleeing. While searching for a replacement egg, Noa encounters a group of ape raiders using electric weapons. As Noa hides from them, the apes follow his horse back to his clan. Noa hurries home to find his village burning; the raider leader Sylva kills Noa's father before dropping Noa from a high platform. Left for dead, Noa awakens, discovering that his clan has been abducted. He buries his father and sets out to rescue his clan. On his journey, he is joined by Raka, an orangutan who tells Noa about Caesar's teachings. The apes notice they are being followed by the human scavenger; Raka offers her food and a blanket, naming her Nova. When the trio encounters a group of feral humans, Sylva's raiders suddenly attack. Noa and Raka rescue Nova who, to their surprise, can speak. She reveals that her name is Mae and that the raiders took Noa's clan to a beachfront settlement outside an old human vault. As they cross a bridge on their way to the settlement, they are ambushed by Sylva. In the ensuing fight, Raka saves Mae from drowning but is swept away by the rapids. Noa and Mae are captured and taken to the apes' settlement. Noa reunites with his clan and is introduced to the apes' self-proclaimed king, Proximus Caesar. Proximus has enslaved other clans, forcing them to work on opening the vault so he can access the human technology locked inside. Proximus invites Noa to dinner along with Mae and Trevathan, a human prisoner who is teaching Proximus about the old human world. Proximus believes that Noa's intelligence could help open the vault and warns him that Mae only has her own agenda. Noa confronts Mae, demanding the truth in exchange for his help. Mae discloses knowledge of a hidden entrance to the vault and says that a mysterious ‘book’ capable of restoring speech to humanity is inside. Noa agrees to help her enter the vault, hoping to destroy Proximus' settlement and lead his clan back home. Noa, Mae, Soona, and Anaya secretly plant explosives around the levee that surrounds the settlement. Trevathan catches them and intends to warn Proximus, but Mae kills him. The group enters the vault, which is a military bunker housing a stockpile of weapons and Mae's 'book', which is actually a deciphering key for a satellite. The apes discover old picture books depicting humans as the once-dominant species and apes in cages at a zoo. As the group makes their way out of the bunker, they are confronted by Proximus and his tribe. Lightning, one of Proximus's apes threatens to kill Soona, but Mae kills him with a gun she found. Proximus tells Mae that she can leave if she tells him where the other weapons are. Mae refuses and triggers the explosives, flooding the bunker with the apes inside. Mae flees the settlement while the apes climb to higher ground through the bunker. Noa is pursued by Sylva, but Noa traps and drowns him. Noa escapes the bunker with his clan, but Proximus attacks him. Noa leads his clan in summoning their eagles to attack Proximus and send him falling off a cliff into the sea. As Noa's clan returns to rebuild their home, Mae arrives to bid farewell to Noa, concealing a gun behind her back but never revealing or using it. She explains that she destroyed the bunker and prevented the apes from accessing the weapons in the bunker because those weapons were created by humans and should only be used by humans. Noa then argues that if weapons and technology are only for humans, it suggests that nothing belongs to the apes, questioning whether apes and humans can coexist peacefully given Mae's fundamental disparity. As Noa takes Soona to look through a telescope he found on his journey, Mae travels to a human settlement at a satellite base, which is kept quarantined from the outside world. Mae delivers the decipher key, allowing the humans to reactivate the satellites and successfully contact other humans worldwide.",

There's a mention of a hidden entrance to a vault and a book involved, which suggests that Mae has some key role early on.\n\nAs Noa is hiding, apes follow his horse back to his clan, implying that his clan is being targeted. The apes are led by Proximus, who later becomes a significant antagonist. Mae later discloses information about the hidden vault and the book, so that must come after she and Noa meet.\n\nThere's a point where Noa and Soona look through a telescope, which seems like an early exploration. Then, Mae goes to a human settlement, which would logically follow after she reveals the information about the vault.\n\nThe fight that leads to Raka saving Mae and being swept away by rapids is likely an early incident that sets the stage for their relationship and the conflicts to come.\n\nThere's a part where Noa's clan is abducted, which must happen after the initial encounters. He later wakes up, discovers his clan missing, and then encounters Proximus, leading to a confrontation.\n\nMae killing Trevathan, a human prisoner, is a pivotal moment that probably occurs after she's aligned with Noa's cause but before the major battle.\n\nThe introduction of lightning, an ape threatening Soona, and Mae killing him with a gun she found happens next. This escalates the conflict.\n\nThere's a part where Mae refuses Proximus's offer and triggers explosives, flooding the bunker with apes inside. This must come after the earlier events but before the climax.\n\nNoa rescues Nova (who can speak) and buries his father, showing a turning point where the apes regain speech and form alliances.\n\nAs Noa and Raka escape the bunker, they are attacked by Proximus. They reunite with their clan and meet Proximus Caesar, indicating the final confrontation is imminent.\n\nMae tells Proximus about the weapons and leaves, but Sylva ambushes them, leading to Noa's father being killed and Noa being dropped from a platform.\n\nAfter that, Noa's clan rebuilds, and Mae bids farewell but hides a gun. Noa then finds a group of ape raiders and discovers old picture books about human dominance.\n\nHe, Mae, Soona, and Anaya plant explosives around a levee, which must be planned after the previous events, and later they are captured by the apes.\n\nRaka joins Noa on his journey, introducing Nova. They're followed by a human scavenger, who inadvertently causes the egg to crack, leading to the conflict with the apes.\n\nThis part might be a turning point that sets up the final battle.\n\nFinally, they confront Proximus, leading to the climax where they plant bombs and trigger the levee, destroying the settlement and freeing the apes from human control.\n\nI think I've mapped out the sequence logically. Now, I'll compile them in order to form the correct plot summary.\n",
    "filtered_answer":"\n\n<PLOT_SUMMARY>  \nIn the ensuing fight, Raka saves Mae from drowning but is swept away by the rapids. As Noa hides from them, the apes follow his horse back to his clan. Noa confronts Mae, demanding the truth in exchange for his help. Mae discloses knowledge of a hidden entrance to the vault and says that a mysterious ‘book’ capable of restoring speech to humanity is inside.  \n\nAs Noa takes Soona to look through a telescope he found on his journey, Mae travels to a human settlement at a satellite base, which is kept quarantined from the outside world. The group enters the vault, which is a military bunker housing a stockpile of weapons and Mae's \"book,\" which is actually a deciphering key for a satellite.  \n\nMany generations after Caesar's death, apes have established numerous clans, while most humans have become feral-esque. Noa leads his clan in summoning their eagles to attack Proximus and send him falling off a cliff into the sea. Left for dead, Noa awakens, discovering that his clan has been abducted. Proximus invites Noa to dinner along with Mae and Trevathan, a human prisoner who is teaching Proximus about the old human world.  \n\nTrevathan catches them and intends to warn Proximus, but Mae kills him. When the trio encounters a group of feral humans, Sylva's raiders suddenly attack. However, a human scavenger follows Noa home and inadvertently cracks his egg during a scuffle before fleeing.  \n\nMae delivers the decipher key, allowing the humans to reactivate the satellites and successfully contact other humans worldwide. Lightning, one of Proximus's apes threatens to kill Soona, but Mae kills him with a gun she found. Mae flees the settlement while the apes climb to higher ground through the bunker.  \n\nProximus believes that Noa's intelligence could help open the vault and warns him that Mae only has her own agenda. Proximus has enslaved other clans, forcing them to work on opening the vault so he can access the human technology locked inside.  \n\nShe reveals that her name is Mae and that the raiders took Noa's clan to a beachfront settlement outside an old human vault. Noa is pursued by Sylva, but Noa traps and drowns him. Mae refuses and triggers the explosives, flooding the bunker with the apes inside.  \n\nNoa and Raka rescue Nova who, to their surprise, can speak. He buries his father and sets out to rescue his clan. Noa then argues that if weapons and technology are only for humans, it suggests that nothing belongs to the apes, questioning whether apes and humans can coexist peacefully given Mae's fundamental disparity.  \n\nNoa escapes the bunker with his clan, but Proximus attacks him. Noa reunites with his clan and is introduced to the apes' self-proclaimed king, Proximus Caesar. Noa agrees to help her enter the vault, hoping to destroy Proximus' settlement and lead his clan back home.  \n\nProximus tells Mae that she can leave if she tells him where the other weapons are. As they cross a bridge on their way to the settlement, they are ambushed by Sylva. Noa hurries home to find his village burning; the raider leader Sylva kills Noa's father before dropping Noa from a high platform.  \n\nAs Noa's clan returns to rebuild their home, Mae arrives to bid farewell to Noa, concealing a gun behind her back but never revealing or using it. While searching for a replacement egg, Noa encounters a group of ape raiders using electric weapons.  \n\nThe apes discover old picture books depicting humans as the once-dominant species and apes in cages at a zoo. Noa, Mae, Soona, and Anaya secretly plant explosives around the levee that surrounds the settlement.  \n\nShe explains that she destroyed the bunker and prevented the apes from accessing the weapons in the bunker because those weapons were created by humans and should only be used by humans. Noa and Mae are captured and taken to the apes' settlement.  \n\nOn his journey, he is joined by Raka, an orangutan who tells Noa about Caesar's teachings. The apes notice they are being followed by the human scavenger; Raka offers her food and a blanket, naming her Nova.  \n\nAs the group makes their way out of the bunker, they are confronted by Proximus and his tribe. Noa, a young chimpanzee from a falconry-practicing clan, prepares for a coming-of-age ceremony by collecting eagle eggs with his friends Anaya and Soona.  \n<\/PLOT_SUMMARY>",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to rearrange this plot summary correctly. Let me read through the sentences and see how they can be ordered chronologically. \n\nThe story starts with Po and his friends being almost arrested and escaping to the Den of Thieves. There, they get help from Han, who's friends with Zhen. Then Ping opens a restaurant. After escaping, Zhen reunites with Po, but she doesn't back down when facing The Chameleon, so they go back to the Den with Li to get help. Master Shifu tells Po he needs to become a spiritual leader, so he can't be the Dragon Warrior anymore. He gives the Staff of Wisdom to Zhen, who defeats The Chameleon. Then Po and the Furious Five train Zhen. They battle The Chameleon, who turns into a chimera. Po struggles but gets saved by his dads. Then they fight Komodo dragons, Po reasons with The Chameleon, but she gives Po the staff back. On returning, Po chooses Zhen as successor, annoying Shifu. Back at the Valley, Po helps Li Shan, and Mr. Zhen reveals The Chameleon is a sorceress who can shape-shift and copy techniques. Po is nearly tricked, thrown off a cliff, but then helps Po escape with Zhen. They go to Juniper City, fight in a tavern, then arrive. Po outsmarts The Chameleon, sends her to prison. Mines say Tai Lung returned, so they go there. After battle, The Chameleon copies kung fu techniques, but Po defeats her. Then it's revealed Zhen was a double agent for The Chameleon, trying to get Po's staff. Po then meets a fox bandit named Zhen trying to steal weapons, goes to The Chameleon's lair, Po is captured, and that's the end?\n\nWait, that seems a bit conflicting. The last part mentions Po meeting a fox bandit named Zhen trying to steal weapons, which probably should be earlier since the initial part involves Zhen (with capital Z) as a friend. Maybe there's a mix-up here. Let me try to put it in order.\n\n1. They escape to the Den of Thieves, meet Han and Zhen.\n2. Ping opens the restaurant.\n3. Reunite with Po, go back to Den of Thieves to get help.\n4. Shifu tells Po to become spiritual leader, needs to find a successor.\n5. Po gives Staff to Zhen who defeats The Chameleon.\n6. Training Zhen with Furious Five.\n7. Battle with chimera The Chameleon, Po almost dies but is saved.\n8. Fight Komodo dragons, Po reasons with The Chameleon but fails, she returns staff.\n9. Return to Valley of Peace, Po chooses Zhen as successor, Shifu annoyed.\n10. Zhen reveals The Chameleon's role, Po nearly escapes but is tricked.\n11. Go to Juniper City, fight tavern, arrive.\n12. Po outsmarts The Chameleon, sends her to prison.\n13. Mines say Tai Lung returned, Tai Lung destroys quarry.\n14. After battle, The Chameleon copies techniques, Po defeats her using the staff.\n15. It's revealed Zhen was a double agent, trying to get the Staff of Wisdom.\n16. Po stumbles upon a fox bandit named Zhen stealing weapons, goes to The Chameleon's lair, gets captured.\n\nWait, but in the initial sentences, it's mentioned that after defeating The Chameleon, Po returns to the Valley and then later encounters the fox bandit Zhen. So maybe the last part is after defeating The Chameleon but before the final battle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the double agent revelation happens after defeating The Chameleon but before the last battle. So perhaps step 15 comes after 14.\n\nSo the correct order should be:\n\nThey escape to Den of Thieves, receive help. Ping opens the restaurant. They go back with Li to get help from the Den. Shifu tells Po to become spiritual leader, give Staff to Zhen. Zhen defeats The Chameleon with the staff. Training Zhen. The Chimera battle, Po is saved. Fighting Komodos, Po fails to reason with The Chameleon. Return to Valley, Po chooses Zhen as successor. Zhen reveals The Chameleon as a sorceress. Po is nearly tricked, saved by Zhen, goes to Juniper City. Tavern fight, arrives. Outsmart The Chameleon, send her to prison. Mines say Tai Lung returned, go there. The Chameleon copies techniques, but Po uses the staff to defeat her. It's revealed Zhen was a double agent, trying to get the staff. Po stumbles upon a fox bandit named Zhen, goes to The Chameleon's lair, gets captured.\n\nWait, but the initial summary ends with Po getting captured, so maybe that's the end.\n",

    "ground_truth":"Three years after defeating Mechagodzilla, Kong has established his new territory in the Hollow Earth and searches for more of his kind. On Earth's surface, Godzilla continues to maintain order between humanity and giant monsters, known as ‘Titans’ — killing Titan Scylla in Rome and resting in the Colosseum afterwards. A Monarch observation outpost stationed in Hollow Earth picks up an unidentified signal. On the surface, the signal causes Jia, the last known survivor of the Iwi tribe from Skull Island, to experience hallucinations and visions, causing her adoptive mother and Kong expert, Dr. Ilene Andrews, to worry. Also sensing the signal, Godzilla leaves Rome and attacks a nuclear plant in France to absorb radiation. He then heads to the lair of the Titan Tiamat in the Arctic. Monarch believes Godzilla is strengthening himself for an oncoming threat. When a sinkhole opens near his home, Kong discovers an uncharted realm where a tribe of his species has survived, including a juvenile named Suko. After a brief initial confrontation, Kong convinces Suko to lead him to the tribe's lair, and the two slowly bond on their journey. The tribe's tyrannical leader, Skar King, battles Kong with the aid of an ancient ice-powered Titan, Shimo, whom he controls with pain using a crystal. Shimo's ice breath injures Kong's right arm, causing frostbite, but with Suko's help, Kong manages to escape after losing his axe. Andrews and Jia, alongside Titan veterinarian Trapper and conspiracy podcaster Bernie Hayes, travel to Hollow Earth to locate the source of the signal. They find the Monarch outpost destroyed. As the group follows the signal, they discover a temple that leads them to a subterranean section that houses a surviving Iwi tribe, who communicate telepathically with each other, living beneath portals to the surface. Inspecting some ruins, they surmise that the signal was a telepathic distress call sent by the Iwi. While observing Jia socializing with the Iwi, Andrews voices her fears to Trapper that Jia may choose to stay with her people and that Andrews would have to accept it. Inside a temple, Andrews uncovers hieroglyphics displaying the past and future: Skar King once attempted to conquer the surface world, forced Shimo to trigger an ice age, and waged war against Godzilla's species, but Godzilla defeated him by trapping him and his tribe deep within Hollow Earth. The prophecy also indicates that Jia would be the key to reawakening Mothra. Sensing Jia, Kong locates the temple and is fitted by Trapper with a prototype exoskeletal glove to strengthen and heal his frostbitten limb. Unknown to them, one of Skar King's loyalists follows them and informs him that the protective barrier leading to the surface portals has been opened. Jia successfully awakens the reborn Mothra. Meanwhile, Godzilla kills Tiamat and absorbs cosmic radiation from her lair, which turns his dorsal plates magenta. Hoping to lure Godzilla to Hollow Earth to assist him, Kong surfaces in Cairo and calls out to Godzilla. Despite Kong's attempts to communicate, Godzilla attacks him, and a brief fight ensues until Mothra intervenes. Godzilla, Kong, and Mothra return to the Hollow Earth and engage Skar King and Shimo in battle. Skar King and Shimo manage to use one of the portals to escape to the surface, forcing Godzilla and Kong to chase them to Rio de Janeiro, and Shimo induces a second ice age at Skar King's command. The factions are evenly matched until Suko arrives with Kong's axe and destroys the crystal controlling Shimo. Shimo freezes Skar King before Kong shatters him to pieces. After undoing Shimo's ice age with his atomic breath, Godzilla returns to rest in the Colosseum. Jia reunites with Andrews and alleviates her fears by choosing to stay with her adopted mother. Mothra restores the protective barrier of the Iwi's home and the portals. Kong returns with Shimo and Suko to Hollow Earth, where he becomes the ape tribe's new leader.",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, I'm trying to help the user by rearranging this plot summary. The user provided a list of sentences that were out of order and wants them put back into a coherent sequence. I need to carefully read through each sentence to understand the flow.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the main plot points. It seems the story involves Godzilla, Kong, and Mothra fighting against other Titans and a group called the Iwi. The Iwi are living underground and communicating telepathically. There are mentions of battles, portals, a vault, and a timeline involving past events.\n\nI notice that some sentences talk about the Iwi's protective barrier and portals early on, which might be the starting point. Then there's a part where Godzilla is maintaining order on the surface and fighting Titan Scylla. That likely comes after the initial setup.\n\nI should look for transitions that connect disjointed sentences. For example, when Kong surfaces in Cairo to call Godzilla, that probably comes after some events have already happened, like the Monarch outpost being destroyed. I need to figure out the order of events in the story's timeline.\n\nI also see mentions of Jia and her adoption by Andrews. This seems important, and it probably happens after Kong finds Suko and theстю tribe. The story also involves a prophecy about Jia waking Mothra, which should be a key turning point later on.\n\nSome parts might be foreshadowing future events, like Godzilla's actions leading to a threat or the opening of portals. There's a lot of action with battles between different factions, so I need to arrange these in a logical sequence.\n\nI'll start by identifying the beginning, where the Iwi's barrier is restored and portals are in place. Then, Monarch outpost picks up a signal, leading to discoveries about the signal being a distress call. On the surface, Godzilla is keeping order, fighting Scylla, and then moving to Hollow Earth after Kong and Mothra return.\n\nNext, the group with Andrews, Jia, Trapper, and Bernie goes to Hollow Earth to find the source. Kong tries to lure Godzilla but fails, leading to a fight where Mothra intervenes. They realize the signal is from the Iwi and follow it to the temple, finding the tribe.\n\nAs they interact with the Iwi, Jia's connection to them is explored, and the prophecy about her waking Mothra is introduced. Simultaneously, there's a threat from Skar King and Shimo, leading to battles inside and outside Hollow Earth.\n\nThere are subplots involving Kong finding Suko, losing his axe, and retrieving it. The ice age caused by Shimo and its effects on Kong's arm also need to be placed in the right sequence.\n\nI should connect these elements by ordering events chronologically. I'll make sure that each major plot point follows logically, such as Kong finding Suko, then encountering Shimo, the fight with Skar King, losing his arm, getting help from Suko, and then regaining his axe.\n\nI'll also ensure that the discovery of the protective barrier and portals happens early, setting the stage for the rest of the story. The involvement of Monarch and their beliefs about Godzilla's strengthening should fit into the middle, as the characters investigate the signal.\n\nIn the end, Jia's role in awakening Mothra is pivotal, so the build-up to that moment should come after all the conflicts and discoveries. The resolution involves the groups uniting and defeating the main threats, leading to a new beginning for Kong.\n\nBy carefully piecing together these elements in the order they logically occur, the plot summary will make sense and flow smoothly for someone reading it.\n",

An indigenous tribe attempts to save Constance by having the spider bite her, but she dies shortly after giving birth to Cassandra. Thirty years later, Cassandra, going by 'Cassie', works as a paramedic in New York City alongside her co-workers Ben Parker and O'Neil.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I've got this task where a plot summary has had its sentences randomly reordered. My job is to figure out the correct order to rewrite it properly. Let me start by looking at the sentences that are provided. There are quite a few, so I need to piece them together in the right sequence.\n\nThe first sentence is about Cassie returning to her apartment and finding Constance's notes. That seems like an early point, perhaps the start of the story or a key revelation. But wait, another sentence says Cassie flies to Peru later on, so maybe that comes after.\n\nThen there are mentions of Cassie using her powers, experiencing visions, and dealing with a sister-in-law named Mary. There's also a 30-year-later scene where Cassie is a paramedic with Ben and O'Neil. So that might be a later part, maybe towards the end of the story.\n\nI also notice a part where Ezekiel has powers and betrays the team, which likely happens somewhere in the middle. There's a scene with a firework factory and a hospital incident where Cassie gets injured, leading to her being blind and paraplegic. That seems significant, so maybe that's towards the end as well.\n\nThere's also a near-death experience in a pool where Cassie sees the future, and then a plane of higher consciousness. That sounds like a pivotal moment, so probably towards the end as she gains her powers or realizes her visions.\n\nWait, the user mentioned it's a reordered plot summary, so I need to piece the events in chronological order. Let me list out the main events:\n\n1. In 1973, a research team led by Ezekiel discovers a spider. Constance dies after being bitten, and Cassie is born.\n2. Cassie's mother is saved by the spider, but Constance dies.\n3. Years later, Cassie returns to her apartment, finds Constance's notes, revealing Ezekiel's identity and his powers.\n4. Cassie uses her powers to help the girls escape but is injured, leading to blindness and paralysis.\n5. She has near-death experiences and gains vision of the future.\n6. She mentors the girls, helps them evade Ezekiel, and eventually stops him.\n7. There's a scene where Ezekiel is lured to a firework factory, trapped, and killed.\n\nI think the key is to start with the 1973 events, then move forward in time to Cassie's apartment discovery, then her using her powers, and so on. Let me try arranging them in that order.\n\nWait, I should make sure that the starting point is correct. The very first sentence might be the beginning of the story, so maybe Cassie returning to her apartment is the first action, but then the story actually starts earlier with the 1973 events. Oh, but the first sentence in the summary given is about Cassie returning, so perhaps that's the starting point.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider that Cassie's return to her apartment is a critical moment where she learns the truth, which then leads her to use her powers and take action against Ezekiel.\n\nI think breaking it down into sections would help. First, the past: 1973 with Ezekiel and Constance. Then present day with Cassie as a paramedic, discovering the truth, using her powers, and the conflict with Ezekiel.\n\nSo perhaps the order is:\n\n- Cassie as a child, with her mother being saved by the spider.\n- Later, in 1973, Ezekiel discovers the spider, Constance dies, Cassie is born.\n- Cassie returns to her apartment (now an adult), finds Constance's notes, learns Ezekiel's identity.\n- Cassie uses her powers to help the girls, but gets injured, leading to her losing eyesight and becoming paraplegic.\n- She has near-death experiences and gains vision into the future, understanding her connection to the spider.\n- She mentors the girls, helps them escape Ezekiel, and ultimately defeats him.\n\nI think that makes sense. The key events are her learning about Ezekiel, using her powers, the conflict, her injury, gaining vision, and defeating Ezekiel.\n\nI should make sure all these points are included in the correct order. Let me list each sentence and see where they fit:\n\n1. Cassie returns to her apartment and finds Constance's notes: this is the present day, after the events of 1973.\n2. She reveals Ezekiel's identity and his powers: this comes after she deciphers Constance's notes.\n3. She uses her powers to guide the girls: this is after she starts using her abilities.\n4. Her clairvoyance: this is a key ability she gains, perhaps after her near-death experience.\n5. She flies to Peru and tracks down the chief: this is part of her journey to understand her past and perhaps confront Ezekiel again.\n6. Mary goes into labor, Ben takes her to the hospital: this seems like a present-day scene, perhaps after Cassie starts using her powers.\n7. Thirty years later, Cassie works as a paramedic: this is the current time, where Cassie is working with Ben.\n8. Ben revives her, but she starts having visions: this is the inciting incident where her powers begin.\n9. She dismisses them as déjà vu, but after failing to prevent O'Neil's death: this leads to her realization of her powers.\n10. The group lures Ezekiel to a firework factory: this is a pivotal moment in the plot where the conflict is resolved.\n11. Cassie escapes and is injured, becoming blind and paraplegic: this is the climax of her conflict with Ezekiel.\n12. She set off the final trap, which kills Ezekiel: the resolution of the conflict.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to structure it more clearly, starting from the beginning:\n\n- 1973: Ezekiel and Constance in Peru, she dies, Cassie is born.\n- Present day: Cassie is a paramedic, revives, starts having visions.\n- She uses her powers to help others, including the girls, but is injured by Ezekiel.\n- She gains the ability to see the future and defeats Ezekiel.\n\nBut in the original plot summary, the first sentence after the beginning is about Cassie returning to her apartment. So perhaps the correct order is:\n\n- In 1973, Ezekiel and Constance, Cassie is born.\n- Cassie as an adult returns to her apartment, finds Constance's notes.\n- She learns Ezekiel's identity and his powers.\n- She uses her powers: helps the girls escape, gets injured, becomes blind.\n- She has near-death experience, gains vision, defeats Ezekiel.\n- 30 years later, she's a paramedic with Ben and O'Neil, using her powers again.\n\nWait, but in the given sentences, the mention of 30 years later and Cassie being a paramedic is separate. So perhaps the correct order is:\n\nStart with the 1973 events, then Cassie as an adult, learning the truth, using her powers, and dealing with Ezekiel, leading up to her being injured, having visions, and defeating him. Then, in the present day, she's a paramedic with Ben, using her powers, and they deal with another situation.\n\nI think that's the structure. So the plot summary should begin with the 1973 events, then Cassie's discovery, use of powers, injury, visions, defeat of Ezekiel, and then her current life as a paramedic, along with the key incidents there.\n\nI need to make sure that all the sentences are included in the correct order. Let me see:\n\nStarting Sentences:\n\n1. In 1973, Ezekiel's team discovers the spider, Constance dies, Cassie is born.\n2. Cassie as an adult returns to her apartment, finds Constance's notes, learns Ezekiel's identity.\n3. She uses her powers to help the girls, gets injured, becomes blind.\n4. She has near-death experience, gains vision, defeats Ezekiel.\n5. 30 years later, Cassie is a paramedic, works with Ben, revives him, starts having visions.\n6. She dismisses them at first, but after O'Neil's death, realizes her powers.\n7. They lure Ezekiel to a firework factory, set traps, he dies.\n8. Cassie wakes up injured, but the girls are safe.\n\nI think that's the logical flow. Let me check if all the sentences fit in this order.\n\nThe sentences provided are:\n\n1. Cassie returns to her apartment and finds Constance's notes, revealing Ezekiel's identity and his powers.\n2. Cassie uses her powers to guide the girls to safety. However, her clairvoyance enables her to see fully into the future.\n3. Cassie flies to Peru and tracks down the tribal chief who saved her mother.\n4. Ben's pregnant sister-in-law Mary goes into labor earlier than expected and he takes her to the hospital, along with the girls, who are seen on camera when in the car.\n5. Thirty years later, Cassie, going by 'Cassie', works as a paramedic in New York City alongside her co-workers Ben Parker and O'Neil.\n6. Ben revives her, but she begins to experience visions. Initially, she dismisses them as déjà vu, but after failing to prevent O'Neil's death, Cassie realizes that she can see into the future.\n7. The group lures Ezekiel to a condemned firework factory and sets up traps to disorient him while Cassie calls for a medical evacuation helicopter to fly to their location.\n8. Cassie wakes up to discover that she is now blind and paraplegic due to her injuries.\n9. Ignoring Cassie's instructions, the girls go to a diner where Ezekiel finds them. Cassie is taken to the hospital just as Mary gives birth to her son.\n10. During a dangerous call, Cassie falls into the water and has a near-death experience.\n11. In 1973 in the jungles of Peru, a research team led by Ezekiel Sims and his pregnant colleague Constance Webb discovers an unidentified species of spider with rare healing properties.\n12. An indigenous tribe attempts to save Constance by having the spider bite her, but she dies shortly after giving birth to Cassandra.\n13. After briefly incapacitating Ezekiel by ramming him with the car, Cassie takes the girls back to Queens and they take refuge in Ben's house.\n14. Cassie assures the girls that she will mentor them in their future roles when the time comes. She steals a taxi and takes Julia, Anya, and Mattie out of the city to hide them in a nearby forest.\n15. Cassie is also drawn to the same girls and intervenes to stop Ezekiel from ambushing them at Grand Central Terminal. Ezekiel intercepts them again, but Cassie rescues the girls in an ambulance and distracts Ezekiel so Ben and Mary can escape.\n16. An ignited firework strikes Cassie in the face, blinding her. Ezekiel, who has limited precognition power and enhanced physical abilities, collects information on three teenage girls: Julia Cornwall, Anya Corazon, and Mattie Franklin. Ezekiel betrays the team and claims the spider for himself, shooting Constance in a struggle over the spider before leaving her for dead.\n17. She experiences a plane of higher consciousness where all living things are connected and where every possible future can be seen. The chief puts Cassie through a ritual that separates her soul from her body. She learns that Constance sought the spider not for fame or money, as she had originally thought, but to save her from having the same fatal hereditary disease that Constance suffered from.\n18. Ezekiel destroys the helicopter and separates the girls, then taunts Cassie with Constance's death.\n19. She sets off the final trap, which fatally crushes Ezekiel. His visions lead him to believe that they are destined to kill him.\n\nOkay, so the order should start with 1973 (sentence 11-12), then move to Cassie's apartment (1), then Cassie using powers (2), flying to Peru (3), Mary's labor (4), 30 years later (5), Ben reviving her (6), group luring Ezekiel (7), Cassie injured (8), ignoring instructions (9), near-death (10),She is blind (8?), then higher consciousness (17), learns about Constance's disease (17 again?), sets traps (7?), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should outline it as:\n\n1. 1973 events (11-12): Ezekiel finds spider, Constance dies, Cassie born.\n2. Cassie as adult: returns to apartment (1), finds notes (1), learns Ezekiel's identity (1).\n3. Uses powers to guide girls (2), clairvoyance (2), flies to Peru (3).\n4. Mary goes into labor (4), Ben takes girls to hospital (4).\n5. 30 years later, Cassie works as paramedic (5), Ben revives her (6), starts seeing visions (6).\n6. Group lures Ezekiel (7), sets traps (7).\n7. Cassie injured, becomes blind (8).\n8. Ignore instructions, go to diner, Ezekiel finds them, Cassie taken to hospital (9).\n9. Near-death experience (10).\n10. Higher consciousness (17), learns about Constance's disease (17).\n11. Ezekiel betrays team (16).\n12. He destroys helicopter, separates girls (16), taunts Cassie (18).\n13. Cassie sets final trap, Ezekiel dies (19).\n14. His visions lead to his death (19).\n\nNow, I need to make sure that each sentence is placed correctly in the overall timeline.\n\nSo, starting with 1973, then Cassie as an adult, then her actions with the girls, the present day scenes with Ben and Mary, the conflict with Ezekiel, and the resolution of her vision.\n\nI think that's a logical flow. I'll map each sentence in the provided list to the timeline:\n\n- 1. Cassie's apartment discovery.\n- 2. Uses powers to guide girls.\n- 3. Flies to Peru.\n- 4. Mary in labor.\n- 5. 30 years later, Cassie as paramedic.\n- 6. Ben revives her, visions start.\n- 7. Group lures Ezekiel.\n- 8. Cassie injured, blind.\n- 9. Girls ignore, diner, Cassie taken.\n- 10. Near-death at water.\n- 11. 1973 events (Ezekiel and Constance).\n- 12. Constance's death, Cassie born.\n- 13. Refuge in Ben's house.\n- 14. Mentoring the girls, stealing taxi.\n- 15. intervening at Grand Central.\n- 16. Ezekiel's actions, betraying team.\n- 17. Higher consciousness, learns about disease.\n- 18. He destroys helicopter, taunts Cassie.\n- 19. Final trap, Ezekiel dies.\n\nWait, this is getting too long. Maybe it's better to write the PLOT_SUMMARY starting from the correct point.\n\nI think the correct order is:\n\nStart with the 1973 discovery (11-12). Then Cassie as an adult, returning to her apartment (1), learning about Ezekiel (1), using her powers (2), helping the girls (2), flying to Peru (3). Then Mary's labor (4), Ben taking them to the hospital (4). Then 30 years later, Cassie as paramedic (5), Ben reviving her (6), experiencing visions (6). The group luring Ezekiel (7), setting traps (7). Cassie gets injured (8). She is taken to the hospital, while the girls go to diner (9). Near-death experience (10). Higher consciousness (17), learns about Constance (17). Ezekiel betrays the team (16). Destroying helicopter, separating girls, taunting Cassie (16,18). Cassie sets final trap, Ezekiel dies (19). His visions lead to his end (19).\n\nI think that's the correct order. Now, I'll write the PLOT_SUMMARY accordingly, starting with <PLOT_SUMMARY> and making sure the sentences are in the correct flow.\n",

    "ground_truth":"In 2010, New York City photographer Jae Donnelly stakes out a private Manhattan home for an exclusive shot. He eventually photographs Prince Andrew walking with Jeffrey Epstein in Central Park after photographing a young girl leaving from the same building just prior. Nine years later, directly after major staffing cuts are announced, young BBC Newsnight guest producer Sam McAlister comes across the photo placed next to a Prince Andrew sponsored, young entrepreneurs event article. So, she tries to contact the photographer. Prince Andrew's private secretary Amanda Thirsk believes the Epstein photo is a key reason the palace's event was not attended by the press. PR representative Jason Stein is consulted, but the prince insists he ended his friendship with Epstein after the mogul's original underage sex scandals had come to light. Jason suggests Amanda should reach out to several 'friendly' reporters to conduct one-on-one interviews to improve Andrew's image. Having spoken to Sam recently, Amanda agrees to meet and negotiate terms for an interview. Called out by a co-worker for being vocally critical of lead presenter Emily Maitlis and for having sensationalist leanings, the programme editor, Esme, has a word with Sam. Including Emily in the dialogue, she tells her she welcomes her innovations, but reminds her they must find a way to work together regardless of the tension. Jae gets back to Sam, sharing photos of young girls going in and out of Epstein's Manhattan home. He insists that Epstein has been doing it for many years. Arriving home, Sam finds her mother, who has been looking after her teenage son Lucas. Working long hours, she does not get to see him often, but she tries to bond with him over a crush he has on a girl and buying him takeout. The next day, Amanda invites Sam to Buckingham Palace. After tea, Sam convinces her to leave the grounds for a drink. Amid negotiations for the potential interview with Prince Andrew, Amanda asks what Emily is like, then what Sam knows about her. She knows that she is also a single mother, formally worked in banking and has been working for Andrew for seven years. Both Amanda are criticised for meeting Sam for drinks by Jason and Sam by another journalist. Upset by the altercation, Sam vents to her mother. Jae calls to let her know that Epstein is about to be taken into custody by the FBI for child sex trafficking. After informing Esme, Sam rushes to Amanda's home to convince Prince Andrew to give Newsnight a TV interview. They hold off until Epstein is suddenly found dead in his cell, and rumours circulate about the men's friendship. Sam gets her and Emily a negotiation meeting in Buckingham Palace with Amanda, the Prince and his daughter Beatrice. Once Newsnight secures the 'scoop of the decade', Sam is seemingly left out of the loop, as Esme and Emily work with two male journalists and do not include her. Her mother gives her a pep talk, reminding her that she was responsible for the story. In the morning, Amanda calls Sam with the interview time. The televised interview broadcast on 16 November 2019 focuses on Andrew's relationship with convicted sex offender Epstein and allegations of Andrew's sexual assault of a minor, which Andrew denies on several occasions. His lack of remorse and accountability on screen – along with now-infamous bizarre, erratic statements about visiting a PizzaExpress in Woking and an apparent inability to sweat – is widely viewed as the public catalyst for the downfall of Prince Andrew, and a major PR crisis for the Royal Family as a whole. Soon afterwards, the Duke chooses to step down from his royal duties. Despite not admitting guilt, in early 2022, Prince Andrew settled out of court for £12 million for Virginia Giuffre's civil lawsuit for alleged sexual assault. Sam McAlister left the BBC in 2021 and now teaches negotiation at the London School of Economics.",

There's tension as Sam is$json' a exchanges with Esme, the program editor, who criticizes her for being critical and sensationalist. Amanda, despite her personal struggles as a single mother, agrees to meet with Prince Andrew and his team to negotiate the interview. Meanwhile, Jason suggests conducting friendly interviews to improve Andrew's image, but it's too late as the crisis has already begun to unfold. Sam feels excluded when Esme and Emily secure the exclusive interview without her, leading to Sam's frustration. The plot then shifts to a flashback of 2010, where photographer Jae Donnelly captures Prince Andrew with Epstein and a young girl. This incident haunts Andrew in 2019 when the photo resurfaces, sparking public outrage. Back in the present, Amanda and Sam work together to finalize the interview with Andrew, but their attempts to secure it are overshadowed by the Palmer's expose. Finally, the climax occurs when the Duke of York steps down from his royal duties, marking the end of his public career.<\/P>",
    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I've got this task where I need to reorder the sentences of a movie plot summary. The sentences are all jumbled up, and I need to rearrange them in the correct order. The user provided a mess of information, and I need to piece it together.\n\nFirst, I'll read through all the sentences to get a gist of what's happening. It mentions Amanda, Sam, Prince Andrew, Emily, and events around some legal issues and media interviews. It seems to be based on real events with Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe sentences cover various points: meetings in Buckingham Palace, legal settlements, PR crises, interviews, people involved like Jason Stein and Esme, setting up the story for Newsnight, and the aftermath of Epstein's death.\n\nI think the plot should start with how it begins, so maybe the initial meeting Amanda has with Sam and Emily. Then, she tries to negotiate an interview. There's also a part where Prince Andrew is in a PR crisis because of the Epstein photo, and the BBC is involved.\n\nSam is a BBC Newsnight producer; she's leftover after the big scoop is secured by others, so she's upset. Then, there's a part about a photographer named Jae who took a photo of Prince Andrew with Epstein, which leads to the downfall.\n\nAfter that, there's discussions with Jason about improving Andrew's image, and Amanda dealing with her own personal life, like her mother and son. There's also a professional relationship between Amanda and Sam, with some tension and negotiation involved.\n\nI'm noticing that the key events are the initial invitation, the setup of the interviews, the PR issues, the photo incident, the legal aspects, and the outcome of Andrew stepping down. So, the plot should flow from setting the scene, to the main conflict with the interview, the discovery of the photo, the repercussions, and the eventual decision by Andrew to step down.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll start with Amanda inviting Sam and Emily. Then, they meet with Prince Andrew. The PR issues with Jason come into play, followed by the encounter with Esme and Emily. Next, Sam is left out, but then she regains her role and tries to get the interview. There's the part where Jae's photos are found, leading to the downfall, and eventually, Andrew stepping down.\n\nI also need to make sure the timeline makes sense. Some parts mention events happening in 2021, 2019, and 2020. I think the main story is in 2021 when Sam is working at the BBC. But there's also backstory with Epstein and the photo in 2010, which is nine years earlier.\n\nWait, the sentence mentions that in 2010, Jae took the photo, and then nine years later, which would be 2019, Sam comes across it. But the timeline in the plot is a bit confusing because the movie is set around 2021-2022. So, perhaps the 2010 event is from the past, leading up to 2019 when the photo is found, then in 2021, Sam is at the BBC.\n\nI think the plot starts with the present situation in 2021 where Sam is trying to get the interview, then Flashback to 2010 when the photo was taken, and then moving forward to how that discovery affects things.\n\nBut the user's response starts with the mother-son part, then moves to the initial meeting, the encounter with Esme, Sam's argument, and then the background with the photo. However, I'm not sure if that's the correct chronological order.\n\nLet me try to outline possible Sequence:\n\n1. Introduction: Amanda, Sam, and Emily meet at Buckingham Palace. This sets the scene.\n\n2. After the meeting, the PR issues arise because of the photo. The palace's event wasn't attended by the press because of the Epstein photo.\n\n3. Sam is called out by Esme for being критическая and sensationalist, but then Amanda agrees to meet again.\n\n4. The interview is scheduled, and Sam is excited but excluded when the interview goes to Esme and Emily instead.\n\n5. The photo of Andrew with Epstein is found by Jae, which leads to the downfall.\n\n6. Jason suggests to Amanda to do some friendly interviews to improve Andrew's image, but it doesn't work.\n\n7. Sam is upset because she tried to convince Andrew to do the interview, but others got the scoop first.\n\n8. The Duke decides to step down.\n\nSo, I think the plot should start with Amanda and Sam's first meeting, followed by the PR crisis caused by the photo, then the internal conflicts at BBC Newsnight, the discovery of the photo, and the aftermath leading to Andrew's decision.\n\nLet me try to arrange the sentences accordingly.\n",
    "filtered_answer":"\n\n<PLOT_SUMMARY>\n<P>At the start of the plot, Amanda, Sam, and Emily meet at Buckingham Palace, setting the stage for negotiations with Prince Andrew. Amanda and Sam discuss how to handle the PR crisis surrounding Prince Andrew due to the leaked photo of him with Jeffrey Epstein. There's tension as Sam is$json' a exchanges with Esme, the program editor, who criticizes her for being critical and sensationalist. Amanda, despite her personal struggles as a single mother, agrees to meet with Prince Andrew and his team to negotiate the interview. Meanwhile, Jason suggests conducting friendly interviews to improve Andrew's image, but it's too late as the crisis has already begun to unfold. Sam feels excluded when Esme and Emily secure the exclusive interview without her, leading to Sam's frustration. The plot then shifts to a flashback of 2010, where photographer Jae Donnelly captures Prince Andrew with Epstein and a young girl. This incident haunts Andrew in 2019 when the photo resurfaces, sparking public outrage. Back in the present, Amanda and Sam work together to finalize the interview with Andrew, but their attempts to secure it are overshadowed by the Palmer's expose. Finally, the climax occurs when the Duke of York steps down from his royal duties, marking the end of his public career.<\/P>",

    "ground_truth":"Alin (Esra Bilgic) and Ozan (Ushan Cakir) are Interpol officers who have been assigned to investigate a series of art thefts around the world. The thief seems to be breaking into museums and stealing the least valuable works of art, ignoring the other priceless artifacts in the same location. They quickly realize that the art thief is not grabbing the least valued paintings at the museums but specifically all paintings related to love. Putting this together helps them figure out the next target for the thief. Alin is right, but the thief is able to grab the painting in broad daylight with no one knowing and leave Alin just enough of a trace, see his face, but not be able to catch him. Alin immediately knows who the thief is now. Her ex-lover, Guney (Birkan Sokullu). Guney and Alin were going steady when he suddenly disappeared, without explanation, and left her heart broken. Interpol chief refuses to arrest Guney, as he is a billionaire and can easily buy the paintings he wants. He also says that Alin has a history with Guney, and hence they need solid evidence against him. Alin decides she's going to use her charm to catch Guney red-handed. When Alin approaches Guney, he asks her for a second chance, and she pretends to reluctantly give in. Guney explains that he ran away the first time as he was scared of commitment. In the meantime, Ozan has the information to figure out who is working with Guney now, and they also find a warehouse where they work. Alin tries to go there and get some evidence, but she's caught by Vera, Guney's hacker. Vera and Alin get into a physical fight, leading Vera to believe Alin is a cop. But she only manages to see her eyes as Alin was wise enough to cover her face. From the recovered material, Alin figures out that the next theft will be in Prague. Alin and Guney spend more time together, and he tells her that he doesn't want to spend time apart, but he has a business trip to Prague for two days. Alin convinces him to take her along. This is when she gets the billionaire treatment, and he takes her on a private jet and gifts her fancy new clothes. On the flight, Vera finds something strange about Alin and tells the other guy on their team, Omer (Hakan Ummak), that she might have been the cop who tried to break into the warehouse. At the time, Guney had dismissed the idea and said it must have been a random break-in. Alin's partner shows up at the hotel, saying she can't be doing a mission that her chief denied, but she's determined to catch Guney. However, Ozan thinks it's just her attraction to him that's keeping her there. Guney takes Alin to a private dress rehearsal for a romantic musical she's been wanting to watch, and it is enough for her to fall for Guney again. Alin and Guney almost go all the way in his hotel room, but Alin claims they're going too fast and leaves. The next day is the day of the robbery, and Guney leaves Alin with a car to use all day while he has some work. The second he's gone, Ozan and she follow him. Yet again, they're unable to catch him, and they're back to Istanbul and square one. Faysal Varli is an old man and a sleaze who is a businessman, and Guney plans on buying his company. Faysal has a private painting collection. He gives Alin and Guney a private viewing of this collection, and immediately, Alin realizes they're all stolen. This gives Guney the idea to break into the highly protected collection. This is a foolproof security system with too many layers, yet Guney has the confidence to break into it. There's a voice and face recognition step, and there are about 75 cameras leading up to the collection, so it's almost an impossible task. Additionally, there's a set of words, like a pass key, that keeps changing, that Faysal himself has to repeat for the vault to open. It's his voice that's recognized, but Guney has a solution for it all. Just as Guney is trying to break in and everything is going to plan, Faysal decides to bring a woman down to the vault. Vera freaks out, but just when they're about to enter the room, Faysal is asked to go back to the house. Alin is there to tell Faysal that his collection is going to be stolen from him, but he doesn't believe her. She tells him that she doesn't know who it will be, but she knows there's a plan. This is obviously not the answer he wants, so he chokes her to try and get her to spill, but Ozan shows up at that moment. He asks for the crime scene, but Faysal tells him to leave if he doesn't have a warrant. Alin decides the best thing to do is leave and take Ozan and the team with her. The next day, Faysal shows up in her bedroom, and finds out it was Guney who stole the painting thanks to her notes in her apartment with all the investigation on Guney. Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and tell him the truth. Guney already knew that Alin worked for Interpol, and he left a trail for her to find him on purpose. Guney had disappeared for some time without a trace because he was caught in Mexico. This left Alin heartbroken because he never reached out to her or told her anything about what he used to do. After 3 years, he did a press conference to show up on the grid again, but by this time, Alin had already started to work for Interpol in Paris. Apparently, he found it really hard to find her, and when he did, he couldn't just tell her he was a thief. So now, he basically made her go in circles to fall in love with him again. Guney takes Alin to his grandfather's house. It seems he got interested in art thanks to his grandfather, who was a wonderful painter but was never recognized for his work. However, the reason Guney decided to start stealing is because when they were first together, Alin told him that the Mona Lisa went up in value only after it got stolen. Faysal stands across from Guney and Alin in front of a lake, a dead end. Faysal shoots past Guney's ear, just missing him to threaten him. This is after Guney has been tormenting Alin to tell him she still loves him all the way while running away from Faysal. Just as Faysal is about to shoot again, Ozan shows up. Guney did Ozan a favor by giving him information about Faysal (when Guney broke into Faysal's vault, he found information and documents that linked Faysal to the drugs trade); in return, Ozan will leave Guney alone because he's only a harmless art and heart stealing person. Since Ozan is an ex-narcotics officer, he is, of course, thrilled to lock up Faysal. Alin promises not to turn Guney in and tells him she loves him. There are two options, one is that Alin stops working for Interpol so that she and Guney can go on a robbing spree since they won't really have anything else to do and they're both clearly so interested in art. On the other hand, Guney will stop stealing for the thrill of it and go back to being just a boring old billionaire. Or maybe they start an underground art gallery together with all the stolen pieces and never get found out.",

    "response":"\n\n<PLOT_SUMMARY: \n\nInterpol officers Alin and Ozan are investigating a series of art thefts. From the recovered material, Alin discovers the next theft will be in Prague. She informs Ozan, though she doesn't know the culprit. Just as Faysal attempts to shoot again, Ozan intervenes. Ozan admits his attraction to Alin, leading him to manipulate her into reigniting their relationship. Guney, aware of Alin's role with Interpol, intentionally left a trail for her to track him. Faysal, a sleazy businessman with a private collection, holds a press conference, but Alin has already transitioned to a new job in Paris with Interpol. The next day, Guney lets Alin use a car for the day but they fail to catch him, returning to Istanbul as the investigation stalls. The thief targets museums, stealing lesser valuable works, dismissively ignoring other artifacts. Guney dismisses this pattern, believing it random. Alin realizes the thief's identity but keeps it secret, driven by her knowledge that Guney began stealing after she told him about the Mona Lisa's increased value post-theft. Guney expresses his love for Alin, but during a confrontation, he choked her before Ozan intervened. \n\nReturning to his grandfather's influence, Guney's passion for art stemmed from his grandfather's unrecognized talent. Guney plans to acquire Faysal's company and access his high-security collection. Alin promises Guney she won't turn him in, revealing her love. She attempts to warn him but Guney demands a second chance, which she pretends to grant reluctantly. They face a security system with 75 cameras and voice recognition, nearly impossible to breach. Despite the challenges, Guney breaks in, reigniting Alin's feelings as he takes her to a musical dress rehearsal. They narrowly avoid a more intimate moment. Convincing him, Alin accompanies him on a private viewing of the collection, discovering all pieces are stolen. She shares this with Faysal, who disbelieves her. Interpol's chief ignores arresting Guney, considering his wealth and influence. \n\nOzon, an ex-narcotics officer, is determined to capture Faysal, while Alin tries to reconcile with Guney. Vera, a hacker, discovers Alin's history, heightening suspicion. Alin chooses to quit Interpol, leading to a decision to either pursue an underground art gallery or new opportunities with Guney. Guney avoids commitment, explaining his past disappearance. Alin's partner confronts her, despite her mission being denied, while Vera and Alin clash, misinterpreting Alin's intentions. Alin resolves to use her charm to catch Guney in the act. Meanwhile, Guney might abandon theft for a quieter life with his wealth, or Alin's plan to expose him could lead to his downfall. As Guney readies the heist, Faysal interferes, complicating the plan. The story concludes with unresolved tensions and the potential for Guney's transformation or continued criminality. Ultimately, Alin's decisions and the characters' fates remain uncertain, leaving the narrative open-ended.>",
    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to help rewrite a plot summary where the sentences have been randomly reordered. The user provided a bunch of sentences and then gave an ordered version, but I think the task is to do this thinking process as if I'm figuring it out for the first time. Let me try to piece this together.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the user's question again. They have a plot summary broken into 28 sentences, all jumbled up. They want me to reorder them correctly, starting with \"PLOT_SUMMARY: \".\n\nHmm, this seems like a fun puzzle, but a bit complex with so many moving parts. I think the best approach is to identify overarching plot points and see where they fit. Let me list out the main elements I can remember from the summary as I go through each sentence.\n\nStarting with the first sentence: \"From the recovered material, Alin figures out that the next theft will be in Prague.\" That seems like a key point about the next target, so maybe that comes early on in the plot. \n\nNext sentence: \"She tells him that she doesn't know who it will be, but she knows there's a plan.\" This is a continuation of the previous thought, probably after she tells someone about the next theft.\n\nThen, \"Just as Faysal is about to shoot again, Ozan shows up.\" That sounds like a climax moment where Ozan stops Faysal. So maybe this comes later when they're trying to capture the criminals.\n\nMoving on, \"Ozan thinks it's just her attraction to him that's keeping her there.\" This gives insight into Ozan's motivations, maybe introducing character relationships.\n\nHe \"basically made her go in circles to fall in love with him again.\" This suggests a developing relationship between Alin and Ozan, perhaps after she breaks up with Guney.\n\n\"Guney already knew that Alin worked for Interpol, and he left a trail for her to find him on purpose.\" Hmm, this seems important for the characters' knowing each other, maybe establishing a history between them.\n\n\"Faysal has a private painting collection.\" Introducing another character, Faysal, and his role as a businessman with a collection.\n\n\"After 3 years, he did a press conference to show up on the grid again, but by this time, Alin had already started to work for Interpol in Paris.\" So Faysal's actions and Alin's new job are connected in time.\n\n\"The next day is the day of the robbery, and Guney leaves Alin with a car to use all day while he has some work.\" This seems like the immediate build-up to the theft, possibly an action sequence.\n\n\"Yet again, they're unable to catch him, and they're back to Istanbul and square one.\" So after failing, they return to their starting point, indicating a repetitive challenge.\n\n\"The thief seems to be breaking into museums and stealing the least valuable works of art, ignoring the other priceless artifacts in the same location.\" This gives the thief's motif — targeting specific, less valuable items.\n\n\"At the time, Guney had dismissed the idea and said it must have been a random break-in.\" This establishes Guney's perspective on the thefts, doubting it's a pattern.\n\n\"Alin immediately knows who the thief is now.\" So Alin figures out the thief based on the pattern she spotted.\n\nHowever, \"the reason Guney decided to start stealing is because when they were first together, Alin told him that the Mona Lisa went up in value only after it got stolen.\" This gives the motivation behind Guney's actions, tied to their past.\n\n\"But she only manages to see his eyes as Alin was wise enough to cover her face.\" blends into their relationship dynamics, possibly a moment of vulnerability.\n\n\"Alin and Guney spend more time together, and he tells her that he doesn't want to spend time apart, but he has a business trip to Prague for two days.\" Setting up a conflict where Guney is leaving, causing issues.\n\n\"This is obviously not the answer he wants, so he chokes her to try and get her to spill, but Ozan shows up at that moment.\" A turning point where Ozan Saves Alin, showing his character.\n\n\"Putting this together helps them figure out the next target for the thief.\" After this incident, they gain intelligence about the next theft.\n\n\"In the meantime, Ozan has the information to figure out who is working with Guney now, and they also find a warehouse where they work.\" So, after figuring out the thief's next move, they discover Guney's current operations.\n\n\"On the flight, Vera finds something strange about Alin and tells the other guy on their team, Omer (Hakan Ummak), that she might have been the cop who tried to break into the warehouse.\" This introduces a new conflict where someone is suspicious of Alin.\n\n\"Alin decides the best thing to do is to leave and take Ozan and the team with her.\" Or, \"they start an underground art gallery together with all the stolen pieces and never get found out.\" So, two options for her decision, indicating a choice point in the plot.\n\n\"Guney and Alin were going steady when he suddenly disappeared, without explanation, and left her heartbroken.\" This is the backstory of their relationship, preceding her job with Interpol.\n\n\"This is when she gets the billionaire treatment, and he takes her on a private jet and gifts her fancy new clothes.\" Shown as a contrast, perhaps after he left — a luxury gesture that doesn't make sense to Alin.\n\n\"This left Alin heartbroken because he never reached out to her or told her anything about what he used to do.\" So Guney's past as a thief might come into play here, affecting their relationship.\n\n\"It seems he got interested in art thanks to his grandfather, who was a wonderful painter but was never recognized for his work.\" This explains Guney's motivation for theft, as inspired by his grandfather's unappreciated talent.\n\n\"Since Ozan is an ex-narcotics officer, he is, of course, thrilled to lock up Faysal.\" Establishes another character's role in apprehending a criminal.\n\n\"Faysal Varli is an old man and a sleaze who is a businessman, and Guney plans on buying his company.\" So Faysal is involved in a business deal, but there's a theft involved when Guney acquires his company.\n\n\"This gives Guney the idea to break into the highly protected collection.\" Motivation for Guney's latest heist — buying a company leads to a high-security collection theft.\n\n\"Alin promises not to turn Guney in and tells him she loves him.\" A pivotal moment where she chooses to protect him despite his actions.\n\n\"Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and tell him the truth.\" She takes initiative to confront him.\n\n\"When Alin approaches Guney, he asks her for a second chance, and she pretends to reluctantly give in.\" A twist where their relationship might reconcile but with conditions.\n\n\"There's a voice and face recognition step, and there are about 75 cameras leading up to the collection, so it's almost an impossible task.\" Describing the security system at the collection they're trying to breach.\n\n\"This is after Guney has been tormenting Alin to tell him she still loves him all the way while running away from Faysal.\" Adding to the tension, Guney's relentless pursuit of Alin while escaping Faysal.\n\n\"This is a foolproof security system with too many layers, yet Guney has the confidence to break into it.\" Highlighting his expertise and determination to hack the system.\n\n\"Guney takes Alin to a private dress rehearsal for a romantic musical she's been wanting to watch, and it is enough for her to fall for Guney again.\" A heartwarming moment where their connection is reignited through shared interests.\n\n\"Alin and Guney almost go all the way in his hotel room, but Alin claims they're going too fast and leaves.\" A near-incident that could have escalated their relationship but ends with Alin's decision to proceed cautiously.\n\n\"Alin convinces him to take her along.\" She takes initiative to be part of the heist, showing her growing confidence and relationship with Guney.\n\n\"He gives Alin and Guney a private viewing of this collection, and immediately, Alin realizes they're all stolen.\" The climax as they discover the true nature of the collection they're viewing.\n\n\"Alin is there to tell Faysal that his collection is going to be stolen from him, but he doesn't believe her.\" Conflict arises as Faysal is skeptical of her claims.\n\n\"Interpol chief refuses to arrest Guney, as he is a billionaire and can easily buy the paintings he wants.\" So, a powerful opponent in law enforcement who turns a blind eye due to Guney's wealth and influence.\n\n\"Alin (Esra Bilgic) and Ozan (Ushan Cakir) are Interpol officers who have been assigned to investigate a series of art thefts around the world.\" Establishing the main characters and their mission.\n\n\"It's his voice that's recognized, but Guney has a solution for it all.\" Guney's countermeasure against the security system, perhaps avoiding detection.\n\n\"Faysal stands across from Guney and Alin in front of a lake, a dead end.\" A confrontation scene where they are cornered but manage to escape.\n\n\"The next day, Faysal shows up in her bedroom, and finds out it was Guney who stole the painting thanks to her notes in her apartment with all the investigation on Guney.\" Faysal discovers Guney's involvement through Alin's research.\n\n\"Guney did Ozan a favor by giving him information about Faysal (when Guney broke into Faysal's vault, he found information and documents that linked Faysal to the drugs trade); in return, Ozan will leave Guney alone because he's only a harmless art and heart stealing person.\" So, Guney provides intel on Faysal, getting a truce with Ozan.\n\n\"He also says that Alin has a history with Guney, and hence they need solid evidence against him.\" Ozan's perspective on their situation and need for more proof.\n\n\"Alin is right, but the thief is able to grab the painting in broad daylight with no one knowing and leave Alin just enough of a trace, see his face, but not be able to catch him.\" The thief's success despite their efforts, leaving a trail but not enough for capture.\n\n\"He asks for the crime scene, but Faysal tells him to leave if he doesn't have a warrant.\" Continuing the conflict between Ozan and Faysal, with Faysal being antagonistic.\n\n\"Guney explains that he ran away the first time as he was scared of commitment.\" Adding depth to Guney's character, discussing his past and fears.\n\n\"Alin's partner shows up at the hotel, saying she can't be doing a mission that her chief denied, but she's determined to catch Guney.\" A new challenge as another character enters the conflict, possibly causing division in their team.\n\n\"Vera freaks out, but just when they're about to enter the room, Faysal is asked to go back to the house.\" A close-call moment where plans are thwarted temporarily.\n\n\"There are two options, one is that Alin stops working for Interpol so that she and Guney can go on a robbing spree since they won't really have anything else to do and they're both clearly so interested in art.\" This seems like a decision point in the plot where the main characters choose a path.\n\n\"Her ex-lover, Guney (Birkan Sokullu).\" So, clinching that she was dating Guney, perhaps resolving previous relationship issues.\n\n\"The second he's gone, Ozan and she follow him.\" So, teaming up to investigate further, following Guney to his location.\n\n\"Additionally, there's a set of words, like a pass key, that keeps changing, that Faysal himself has to repeat for the vault to open.\" Introducing a dynamic security element that the team needs to overcome.\n\n\"Apparently, he found it really hard to find her, and when he did, he couldn't just tell her he was a thief.\" Adding emotional weight toGuney's past, his difficulty in revealing his true self to Alin.\n\n\"Faysal shoots past Guney's ear, just missing him to threaten him.\" An action-packed moment between Faysal and Guney, showing tension between them.\n\n\"Vera and Alin get into a physical fight, leading Vera to believe Alin is a cop.\" This escalates the conflict, with Vera misinterpreting Alin's intentions.\n\n\"Alin decides she's going to use her charm to catch Guney red-handed.\" Alin taking charge in a different way, perhaps using her skills to manipulate or catch the thief.\n\n\"On the other hand, Guney will stop stealing for the thrill of it and go back to being just a boring old billionaire.\" A contrast of Guney's possible future, abandoning theft for a quieter life, or Alin's alternative approach.\n\n\"Just as Guney is trying to break in and everything is going to plan, Faysal decides to bring a woman down to the vault.\" Adding a twist where Faysal interferes with the heist.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the correct order starts with the initial mission, the discovery of the next theft, the introduction of main characters and conflicts, and then builds up to the heist. \n\nI'll need to arrange the sentences in a logical sequence, considering the flow of the story: introduction, setup, conflicts, rising action, climax, and resolution. Important events like the introduction of the next target in Prague, the failed heist, Alin figuring out the thief, the confrontation with Ozan, Guney's past motivations, his reconcile attempt with Alin, the heist, and the aftermath should be placed in a chronological order.\n\nIt's important to ensure that each sentence flows into the next, maintaining the plot's coherence and continuity. If I get stuck, I can group similar events or look for clues that indicate the order of events based on character actions or setting shifts.\n\nOverall, this requires careful analysis of each sentence to piece together the story accurately. Maybe I'll start by grouping the plot points into main acts, such as introduction, rising action, climax, and resolution, and place each sentence based on where it fits in those acts.\n",
    "filtered_answer":"\n\n<PLOT_SUMMARY: \n\nInterpol officers Alin and Ozan are investigating a series of art thefts. From the recovered material, Alin discovers the next theft will be in Prague. She informs Ozan, though she doesn't know the culprit. Just as Faysal attempts to shoot again, Ozan intervenes. Ozan admits his attraction to Alin, leading him to manipulate her into reigniting their relationship. Guney, aware of Alin's role with Interpol, intentionally left a trail for her to track him. Faysal, a sleazy businessman with a private collection, holds a press conference, but Alin has already transitioned to a new job in Paris with Interpol. The next day, Guney lets Alin use a car for the day but they fail to catch him, returning to Istanbul as the investigation stalls. The thief targets museums, stealing lesser valuable works, dismissively ignoring other artifacts. Guney dismisses this pattern, believing it random. Alin realizes the thief's identity but keeps it secret, driven by her knowledge that Guney began stealing after she told him about the Mona Lisa's increased value post-theft. Guney expresses his love for Alin, but during a confrontation, he choked her before Ozan intervened. \n\nReturning to his grandfather's influence, Guney's passion for art stemmed from his grandfather's unrecognized talent. Guney plans to acquire Faysal's company and access his high-security collection. Alin promises Guney she won't turn him in, revealing her love. She attempts to warn him but Guney demands a second chance, which she pretends to grant reluctantly. They face a security system with 75 cameras and voice recognition, nearly impossible to breach. Despite the challenges, Guney breaks in, reigniting Alin's feelings as he takes her to a musical dress rehearsal. They narrowly avoid a more intimate moment. Convincing him, Alin accompanies him on a private viewing of the collection, discovering all pieces are stolen. She shares this with Faysal, who disbelieves her. Interpol's chief ignores arresting Guney, considering his wealth and influence. \n\nOzon, an ex-narcotics officer, is determined to capture Faysal, while Alin tries to reconcile with Guney. Vera, a hacker, discovers Alin's history, heightening suspicion. Alin chooses to quit Interpol, leading to a decision to either pursue an underground art gallery or new opportunities with Guney. Guney avoids commitment, explaining his past disappearance. Alin's partner confronts her, despite her mission being denied, while Vera and Alin clash, misinterpreting Alin's intentions. Alin resolves to use her charm to catch Guney in the act. Meanwhile, Guney might abandon theft for a quieter life with his wealth, or Alin's plan to expose him could lead to his downfall. As Guney readies the heist, Faysal interferes, complicating the plan. The story concludes with unresolved tensions and the potential for Guney's transformation or continued criminality. Ultimately, Alin's decisions and the characters' fates remain uncertain, leaving the narrative open-ended.>",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to help fix this plot summary by putting the sentences in the right order. Let me read through each sentence and figure out where they go.\n\nFirst, I see that the sentences are all over the place, covering different parts of the story. I should start by identifying the main events and see how they connect in time.\n\nThe beginning seems to be about the aftermath of something happening, so I think that's the first point. The village mourns, Kora admits her past, Titus reveals he knew. Then Kora and Gunnar become lovers, and she tells about Regent Balisarius compelling her to assassinate. She shot Princess Issa, and Issa is alive. Then the group decides to find her. But then it goes into training and preparing, which might come later.\n\nWait, but then it goes into the battle where Titus and Tarak fight, Nemesis dies. Then the second wave comes, they lose ground, Kora and Gunnar use a shuttle to infiltrate the dreadnought, lay explosives. They harvest grain to prevent bombing, train villagers. \n\nThen Noble comes, forces scan the village, send to capture women and children to get Kora. Kora and warriors go back to Veldt, thinking they killed Noble, but it's a ruse. Then Jimmy arrives, explosives destroy the ship. Victory happens, Gunnar dies.\n\nWait, but in the original, Kora and Gunnar become lovers, then she admits about Issa's assassination, reveals Issa is alive. So that part comes after the initial events.\n\nI think the story is structured as the events leading up to the battle, the battle itself, and then the aftermath where Issa is restored. But in the provided sentences, they are all out of order.\n\nLet me try to structure it step by step:\n\n1. Aftermath: village mourns, Kora admits past, Titus knew. They become lovers, Kora tells about Balisarius, shot Issa, Issa alive. Group plans to find Issa, restore throne, depose Balisarius. They reveal pasts but Kora doesn't share her role. Kora tries to surrender but Gunnar ambushes. Balisarius tried to frame her, she fled to Veldt. \n\n2. Meanwhile, Titus and Tarak repel first wave, Nemesis dies. Second wave comes, villagers pushed back, village destroyed. Kora and Gunnar infiltrate dreadnought, lay explosives. They harvest grain. Titus trains villagers over two days to fight, dig trenches, prepare explosives, shuttle.\n\n3. Noble arrives with dreadnought, scans village, sends forces to capture women\/children to get Kora. Kora and warriors return to Veldt, thinking they killed Noble. Aris says dreadnought is coming in five days. Jimmy arrives, explosives destroy ship. Victory, Gunnar kills Noble but dies. \n\nSo I need to rearrange the sentences according to this flow. Let me list out the sentences grouped by these sections.\n\nFirst Group: aftermath and initial events\n- \"In the aftermath, the village mourns the dead, and Kora admits her past, which Titus reveals he already knew.\"\n- \"Kora and Gunnar become lovers, and she admits that Regent Balisarius compelled her involvement in the assassination of the Motherworld's king, queen, and young Princess Issa, with Kora herself shooting the princess. He also reveals that Issa is secretly alive and in hiding.\"\n- \"The group also reveal their pasts to each other, but Kora declines to share her involvement in Issa's death.\"\n- \"Kora attempts to surrender to him once Noble promises to spare the village, but Gunnar triggers the ambush anyway.\"\n- \"Balisarius had then attempted to frame her for the coup, but she had instead fled to Veldt in a Motherworld shuttle to hide from the law.\"\n\nSecond Group: the battle\n- \"Titus and Tarak lead the villages in successfully repelling the first wave, though Nemesis is killed defending the women and children.\"\n- \"The large contingent of heavily armored and mechanized second wave of Motherworld troops pushes the few remaining defenders back, destroying much of the village, but Kora and Gunnar use the shuttle and stolen uniforms to infiltrate the dreadnought, laying explosives on the engine.\"\n- \"The fighters join the small group of villagers to harvest the entire grain supply in three days, so the flour can be used as leverage to prevent the Motherworld forces from simply bombing the village from orbit; over the remaining two days, Titus intends to train the villagers to fight.\"\n- \"Over two days, Titus, Nemesis, Tarak, Milius, and Kora train the handful of villagers in combat, preparing a plan involving digging trenches and tunnels in the fields, laying explosives, and preparing Kora's shuttle.\"\n\nThird Group: aftermath after the battle\n- \"When Noble arrives with the dreadnought, his forces scan the village, identifying where the women and children are hiding, protected by Nemesis and Aris, and send forces to capture them to force Kora out.\"\n- \"Kora and the surviving warriors return to Veldt, believing that Kora had killed Admiral Noble in hand-to-hand combat and prevented the forthcoming assault on the planet to claim its food supplies, but Aris, a Motherworld soldier working as a double agent for the village people, informs them that the dreadnought ship will arrive in five days.\"\n- \"Jimmy arrives to help the village defenders push back the assault, and the explosives bring down the dreadnought.\"\n- \"In the process, Gunnar kills Noble but later dies from his injuries.\"\n\nNow, put them in order:\n\nStart with PLOT_SUMMARY, then the first group, then the battle, then the aftermath.\n\nBut wait, the initial part after the aftermath mentions Kora and Gunnar becoming lovers, then the assassination, etc. So the initial events are after the aftermath.\n\nSo the structure would be:\n\n<PLOT_SUMMARY>\nIn the aftermath... (group 1 starts)\n... N.customer)<\/PLOT_SUMMARY>\n\nWait, the user's example output started with PLOT_SUMMARY, then the first group, then the battle, then the final events.\n\nLet me structure the corrected plot summary accordingly.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, I'm faced with this query where someone has provided a plot summary of a movie, but the sentences are randomly reordered. My task is to figure out how to correctly reorder them. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the user's goal. They want me to reconstruct the plot summary correctly by rearranging the given sentences. That makes sense because without knowing the original order, it's a bit tricky. But I can approach this by identifying the sequence of events and how they logically flow.\n\nLooking at the given sentences, there are 17 of them. My goal is to place them in the correct chronological order so the plot makes sense.\n\nLet me list all the sentences:\n\n1. Nam-san, Ji-wan, and Lee Eun-ho discover Gi-su's experiments and go to rescue Su-na.\n2. Su-na is kidnapped by Dr., a rogue scientist.\n3. They rescue Su-na and Gi-su escapes with So-yeon's body.\n4. Mob surrounds Gi-su and he's about to be beaten to death.\n5. Nam-san kills Gi-su.\n6. Nam-san returns to his village with Su-na and Ji-wan.\n7. In a post-apocalyptic Seoul, Nam-san and Ji-wan are surviving.\n8. Gi-su's experiments with immortality serum kill many teenagers.\n9. Nam-san, Ji-wan, and Eun-ho fight mutant soldiers at the camp.\n10. They navigate wastelands scavenging resources.\n11. While shooting, Nam-san damages the suitcase, killing So-yeon.\n12. Gi-su's experiments were to revive his daughter So-yeon.\n\nNow, I'll try to find the logical flow.\n\nThe story likely starts with the characters (Nam-san, Ji-wan, Eun-ho) discover Gi-su's experiments and try to rescue Su-na. So that's the first part.\n\nThen, Su-na is kidnapped by Dr. Something. After the rescue, there's a mob attack. So that follows: after saving Su-na, Gi-su is in trouble, then killed by Nam-san. Then they return to their village.\n\nAt their village, we need to show the setting. So the post-apocalyptic Seoul and their hard life with scavenging resources.\n\nThen, we transition to Gi-su's background: his experiments, the serum, the dead teenagers. This might be after some time, so probably after they've settled in the village.\n\nAfter that, they go to the camp where mutant soldiers are, leading to a fight. Then, during a scavenger mission, the suitcase is damaged.\n\nFinally, we reveal why Gi-su was experimenting: to revive his daughter So-yeon who died when Seoul became a wasteland.\n\nPutting it all together, the correct order should start with the rescue mission, the kidnapping, mob attack, Gi-su's demise, returning to the village, then showing their current life, introducing Gi-su's past, the fight at the camp, scavenging for resources, the accidental death of So-yeon, and finally revealing the motivation behind his experiments.\n\nWait, I think I might have mixed up some points. Let me check again.\n\nPoint 7: Post-apocalyptic setting comes after they return to the village, so that should be after point 6.\n\nPoint 8: Gi-su's history happens after they settle, so that's after point 7.\n\nThen, point 9: They go to the camp after that, so after point 8.\n\nPoint 4: After the rescue, the mob attack happens, so point 4 should come after point 3? Or does the mob attack happen at the camp or elsewhere?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps point 4 is at the camp, so after they arrive at the camp in point 9, the mob is there.\n\nWait, maybe the timeline is:\n\n1. They go to the camp (point 1)\n2. Discover experiments (point 8?) or is point 8 more about Gi-su's past? Hmm, no, point 8 is about his past experiments.\n\nWait, perhaps the order should be:\n\nStart with the current setting in the village (post-apocalyptic), then show why they're there. Then go back to the rescue of Su-na and the subsequent events, including the fight at the camp and the revelation about So-yeon.\n\nWait no, the beginning is the rescue, leading to the mob, then returning to the village, then showing their life there, then going to the camp, and during that, the suitcase incident. Then finally, the revelation about So-yeon.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to structure it as a timeline:\n\n- The beginning: Nam-san, Ji-wan, and Eun-ho go to rescue Su-na.\n\n- While there, Su-na is kidnapped by Dr. (point 2 and 3? Or point 2 is the kidnap, then point 3 is the rescue.)\n\nWait, in the sentences, point 1: they discover experiments and rescue Su-na.\n\nPoint 2: Su-na is kidnapped.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Hmm, maybe point 1 is their discovery and rescue attempt, during which Su-na is kidnapped. Then point 2 is the kidnap, then point 3 is the rescue.\n\nBut the initial summary seems to say they rescue her, but point 2 says she was kidnapped. That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps point 1 is their attempt to rescue and during that, she was kidnapped. Then in point 2, the kidnap, then in point 3, they rescue her.\n\nWait, no, the sentences are separate. Let me reread them.\n\n1. Nam-san, Ji-wan, and Lee Eun-ho discover Gi-su's experiments and go to rescue Su-na.\n\n2. Trouble ensues when Su-na is kidnapped by a rogue scientist, Dr. They manage to rescue Su-na...\n\nHmm, so perhaps the correct order is that they go to rescue her, but during that, she's first kidnapped. Then they find a way to rescue her.\n\nWait, but in the sentences, point 1 is the entire action, and point 2 is a complication. So perhaps point 1 is before point 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe point 2 is a separate event. Wait, no, they can't be. They must be connected.\n\nWait, I think the sentences are part of the same plot, so the correct order needs to have the events in sequence.\n\nWait, to clarify: sentence 1 says they come to rescue, sentence 2 complicates as Su-na is kidnapped during that, then they manage to rescue.\n\nSo the order is: they go to rescue (1), Su-na is kidnap (2), rescue her (3), then mob attacks (4). Then, back to village (6), etc.\n\nWait, no, in the sentences, point 3 is that they manage to rescue Su-na while Gi-su escapes with So-yeon's body.\n\nThen, the mob surrounds Gi-su (point 4). So after they rescue Su-na, the mob is after Gi-su, who gets killed by Nam-san (point 5). Then they return to the village (6). So the sequence would be 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nThen, point 7 is the post-apocalyptic setting.\n\nPoint 8: Gi-su's past experiments with serum.\n\nThen, point 9: They fight at the camp.\n\nPoint 10: Navigating wastelands.\n\nPoint 11: Damages suitcase, killing So-yeon.\n\nPoint 12: Gi-su's experiment to revive daughter.\n\nWait, but in point 12, it's revealed that Gi-su is trying to revive his daughter, which is a background that probably comes earlier.\n\nWait, maybe point 8 is before the fight at the camp.\n\nI'm getting tangled. Let me try to list them in the order I think.\n\n1. They go to rescue Su-na from the camp (1).\n\n2. Su-na is kidnapped by Dr. (2).\n\n3. They rescue Su-na and Gi-su escapes with So-yeon's body (3).\n\n4. Mob surrounds Gi-su, ready to beat him (4).\n\n5. Nam-san kills Gi-su (5).\n\n6. They return to their village (6).\n\nThen, in the village, they're living in the post-apocalyptic Seoul (7).\n\nGi-su's experiments are detailed, leading to deaths (8).\n\nThen, they go to the camp (probably later), fight mutant soldiers (9).\n\nThen, while scavenging, damage suitcase, kill So-yeon (11).\n\nThen, reveals that Gi-su was trying to revive his daughter (12).\n\nSo the order would be: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.\n\nWait, but point 10 is before 11. So that makes sense.\n\nBut perhaps the fight at the camp (point 9) happens before the scavenging (point 10) and suitcase incident (11). So yes, 9,10,11.\n\nHmm. Maybe that's correct. So to put it all together, the correct plot summary should start with them rescuing, then the mob attack, returning to village, then their current life, arriving at the camp, fighting, scavenging, and finally the revelation about So-yeon.\n\nWait, but point 8 comes after they are in the village, so the flow would be: after returning to village, they learn about Gi-su's past, then go to the camp.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order should be:\n\n1. Rescue Su-na, then kidnap (but that's conflicting, as point 1 is the rescue).\n\nWait, maybe sentences 1 and 2 are two separate actions. It's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps point 2 is a continuation of point 1, so they go to rescue, then the trouble of Su-na being kidnapped. Then they manage to rescue, leading to the mob, etc.\n\nI think I need to accept that the user provided 17 sentences, and I have to arrange them in the correct order. Without more information, the best approach is to find the logical flow and place them accordingly.\n\nI think the final plot summary will have:\n\n- The immediate events: rescue mission, kidnap, rescue, mob attack, Gi-su's death, returning to the village.\n\n- Then the setting in the village, Gi-su's history, fight at camp, scavenging, suitcase incident, and the revelation.\n\nPutting that together, I can now reconstruct the plot summary correctly.\n",

    "ground_truth":"Cyrus (Kevin Hart), a renowned international thief, leads a heist crew that consists of Denton (Vincent D'Onofrio), pilot Camila (Ursula Corbero), hacker Mi-Sun (Kim Yoon-Ji), safe-cracker Magnus (Billy Magnussen), and engineer Luke (Viveik Kalra). They undertake two simultaneous thefts, stealing a Van Gogh painting in London while staging the fake kidnapping of renowned NFT artist N8 (Jacob Batalon) in Venice. N8 was in Venice to auction a single edition NFT. The NFT by N8 is made by a self portrait mask comprising of 482 cameras. This mask will create the NFT, with a live 30-second feed from the auction itself. Once complete, the NFT will have captured the moment of its sale, which will include the buyer. The team staged a kidnapping for N8 and Cyrus points out that famous paintings rapidly increase in value after being stolen and he says that his crew stole the Van Gogh painting and sold it in the black market for $20 million to buy N8 NFTs. After being 'kidnapped', N8's NFT ballooned in value to $89 million. N8 decides to celebrate with the team after being promised a cut of the money ($27 million). Interpol agent Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a former fling of Cyrus, uncovers evidence implicating Denton, in the theft and arrests him. Denton was seen at the auction and Abby correctly deduced that his limp was a fake. Abby charges Denton with fraud since he participated in the auction and made a bid of more than $10 million, and he didn't have the funds to cover it. So that makes him eligible for extradition to the US. Rather than proceed with charges against the crew, Abby's superior, Commander Huxley (Sam Worthington), leverages their legal predicament to force them to help capture billionaire Lars Jorgenson (Jean Reno), who intends to make more money by working with the hacking group Leviathan to stage a massive flooding in Europe, allowing him to make billions in profit through stock manipulation. Lars was responsible for making millions by shorting airlines stock, after the crash of a New Zealand plane that killed 189 people. Now Huxley has a mole in Lars's organization named Arthur Tigue. As Leviathan requires payment of $500 million in untraceable gold bullion, Jorgenson has arranged for a shipment of gold to be taken from his vault in London and flown to Leviathan's bank in Zurich via a commercial airliner. Huxley cannot intercept the gold as it is a legal transaction. Huxley wants Cyrus and his crew to intercept this gold payment to Leviathan. Cyrus knows that Lars is a dangerous man and not to be trifled with, but Abby lures him in with an offer of full immunity for him and his entire crew, As part of the deal, Cyrus insists Abby join the team to provide certain cover for Interpol. Cyrus argues that with Abby on the team Interpol will not hang the team out to dry if things do not go as per plan. The gold weighs ten tons and will be delivered to Heathrow airport under armored cover. It will be loaded onto a Sky Suisse A-380 passenger plane to Zurich. The crew determines they will only be able to steal the gold while the airliner is in mid-air. To do so, they procure a private jet from a rich private art collector named Molsen that Camila will fly directly underneath the airliner, allowing Mi-Sun to switch the radar signals to make it seem like the plane is still on course while the crew diverts it to a private airfield. Mi-Sun says that the chances of turning on the signal Jammer on the A-380 and the transponder on the private jet (to mimic the A-380's signal) are next to zero. Out of UK airspace, Brussels ATC will be tracking the flight, and Abby has a contact there who will help them. Harry agrees to help Cyrus against a payment of a million dollars. In exchange for loaning his private jet, Cyrus promises Molsen to persuade N8 to make a special NFT art for him. After Magnus cracks the safe and Jorgenson's henchmen are incapacitated, the crew will extract the gold from the A-380 once it lands in the Swiss Alps. Their timing is complicated when Jorgenson executes a mole Arthur Tigue (Jess Liaudin) in his organization and moves up the delivery date. Nevertheless, the crew is ready on time. The crew takes their position on the A-380 on the day the gold is being transferred, but Luke pulls out of the heist at the last minute. Cyrus and his team successfully divert the plane. Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the A-380, Abby assembles and turns on the signal Jammer on the A-380, while Camila turns on the transponder to mimic the A-380 signal. Harry then calls the A-380 pilots and diverts them to Cortina due to heavy weather in Zurich. Camila puts the transponder on a drone headed to Zurich and follows the A-380 to Cortina. Jorgenson's henchmen (including Cormac (Burn Gorman) & Donal (Paul Anderson)) attempt a hijack, resulting in the plane crash landing at Cortina, followed by Camila landing the Molsen jet at the airport. Magnus, Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured. Magnus escapes on the ground, while the remaining three are taken aboard the Molsen jet with the gold, headed for Jorgenson's estate in Tuscany. Desperate for the gold to not reach Jorgenson, Huxley orders the plane shot down by NATO. Harry (David Proud), the crew's contact at air traffic control, works with Camila (who was piloting the Molsen jet) to get a message to the NATO fighter pilots that there are hostages on board the A-380, forcing them to stand down. Another fight between the crew and Jorgenson's henchmen results in the jet crash landing on the grounds of Jorgenson's villa. Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured at gunpoint by Jorgenson, who also executes Leviathan's representative after they decide to cancel the deal. The Carabinieri arrive, and Cyrus uses N8's NFT technology to show them a recording of Jorgenson murdering the representative. Jorgenson is arrested, while Abby punches Huxley upon learning he authorized the NATO jets. She resigns from Interpol and joins Cyrus. Weeks later, Cyrus reveals to Abby that the crew stole the gold shipment during the heist on the airliner, replacing the actual shipment with iron bars painted to look like gold. The real gold shipment was parachuted out of the A-380 into the Swiss Alps while it was approaching the Cortina landing strip. Luke was never out; he guided the parachute to a recoverable spot in the mountains via remote control. Together, the crew recover their gold haul and celebrate their success while Cyrus and Abby kindle their relationship.",

Their timing is complicated when Jorgenson executes a mole Arthur Tigue (Jess Liaudin) in his organization and moves up the delivery date. Cyrus argues that with Abby on the team Interpol will not hang the team out to dry if things do not go as per plan. Desperate for the gold to not reach Jorgenson, Huxley orders the plane shot down by NATO. Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the A-380, Abby assembles and turns on the signal Jammer on the A-380, while Camila turns on the transponder to mimic the A-380 signal. The NFT by N8 is made by a self portrait mask comprising of 482 cameras. Harry (David Proud), the crew's contact at air traffic control, works with Camila (who was piloting the Molsen jet) to get a message to the NATO fighter pilots that there are hostages on board the A-380, forcing them to stand down. Nevertheless, the crew is ready on time. Out of UK airspace, Brussels ATC will be tracking the flight, and Abby has a contact there who will help them. Camila puts the transponder on a drone headed to Zurich and follows the A-380 to Cortina. She resigns from Interpol and joins Cyrus. Now Huxley has a mole in Lars's organization named Arthur Tigue. Magnus, Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured. Jorgenson's henchmen (including Cormac (Burn Gorman) & Donal (Paul Anderson)) attempt a hijack, resulting in the plane crash landing at Cortina, followed by Camila landing the Molsen jet at the airport. It will be loaded onto a Sky Suisse A-380 passenger plane to Zurich. Another fight between the crew and Jorgenson's henchmen results in the jet crash landing on the grounds of Jorgenson's villa. The Carabinieri arrive, and Cyrus uses N8's NFT technology to show them a recording of Jorgenson murdering the representative. The gold weighs ten tons and will be delivered to Heathrow airport under armored cover. Rather than proceed with charges against the crew, Abby's superior, Commander Huxley (Sam Worthington), leverages their legal predicament to force them to help capture billionaire Lars Jorgenson (Jean Reno), who intends to make more money by working with the hacking group Leviathan to stage a massive flooding in Europe, allowing him to make billions in profit through stock manipulation. Denton was seen at the auction and Abby correctly deduced that his limp was a fake. After being 'kidnapped', N8's NFT ballooned in value to $89 million. N8 was in Venice to auction a single edition NFT. In exchange for loaning his private jet, Cyrus promises Molsen to persuade N8 to make a special NFT art for him. So that makes him eligible for extradition to the US. Cyrus (Kevin Hart), a renowned international thief, leads a heist crew that consists of Denton (Vincent D'Onofrio), pilot Camila (Ursula Corbero), hacker Mi-Sun (Kim Yoon-Ji), safe-cracker Magnus (Billy Magnussen), and engineer Luke (Viveik Kalra). Jorgenson is arrested, while Abby punches Huxley upon learning he authorized the NATO jets. Abby charges Denton with fraud since he participated in the auction and made a bid of more than $10 million, and he didn't have the funds to cover it.",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I have this plot summary for a movie that's all jumbled up, and I need to put it back in order. Let me try to figure out how to do this step by step. First, I should probably read through all the sentences to get a sense of the main plot points.\n\nAlright, the summary starts with The crew takes their position on the A-380 on the day the gold is being transferred, but Luke pulls out of the heist at the last minute. Hmm, that seems important because it sets up the crew's plan. Then, the real gold shipment was parachuted out of the A-380 into the Swiss Alps while it was approaching the Cortina landing strip. So, it sounds like there's a heist involving a plane and a parachute drop.\n\nNext, weeks later, Cyrus reveals to Abby that the crew stole the gold shipment during the heist, replacing the actual shipment with iron bars painted to look like gold. So, Cyrus is telling Abby about the heist, which probably comes after the initial event.\n\nThen, Abby is an Interpol agent who uncovers evidence implicating Denton in the theft and arrests him. So, this must come after Cyrus tells her about the heist, maybe after they've already taken the gold.\n\nThe crew determines they'll only be able to steal the gold while the airliner is in mid-air. So, they plan their approach around the plane being in flight. Luke was never out; he guided the parachute to a recoverable spot via remote control. That explains how the gold was retrieved.\n\nAs Leviathan requires payment in gold bullion, Jorgenson has a shipment from his vault in London flown to Zurich. Huxley wants Cyrus to intercept this to pay Leviathan. Since it's a legal transaction, Huxley can't intercept it directly.\n\nN8 celebrates with the team after being promised a cut of the money. So, they successfully do something, get their share.\n\nHarry diverts the plane pilots due to heavy weather, and the crew successfully diverts it to Cortina. So, this must be part of their plan.\n\nAfter Magnus cracks the safe and some henchmen are disabled, they extract the gold once the plane lands in the Alps. Then they celebrate, and Cyrus and Abby kindle their relationship. So, this seems to wrap up the immediate heist part.\n\nLars made millions by shorting airlines stock after a plane crash. To do this, they procure a private jet from a collector so Camila can fly under the plane and switch signals. This is likely another part of their plan, maybe even before the main heist.\n\nThey stage a kidnapping for N8 and Cyrus points out that stolen Van Gogh paintings can be sold for millions. They plan two simultaneous thefts: stealing the Van Gogh in London while faking N8's kidnapping in Venice. This must be part of their preceding actions.\n\nMi-Sun says the chances of jamming signals are slim. Magnus escapes, and the team takes the gold on the Molsen jet to Jorgenson's estate. Harry offers to help Cyrus for a million.\n\nOnce done, the NFT captures the sale moment. Cyrus knows Lars is dangerous but teams up with Abby for immunity. Abby joins the team to help with Interpol. They get captured by Jorgenson, who kills a representative. There's a mole, Arthur, who moves up the delivery date.\n\nCyrus argues that Abby's involvement will protect them. Huxley orders the plane shot down, but Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the plane. Abby jams signals, and Camila mimics the plane's signal. Harry contacts NATO pilots about hostages, making them stand down.\n\nThey're ready on time, and Brussels ATC helps. Camila follows the plane to Cortina and resigns from Interpol to join Cyrus. Then, there's a mole in Jorgenson's organization, and Magnus, Abby, etc., get captured.\n\nJorgenson's henchmen hijack the plane, causing it to crash. The Molsen jet lands, and the crew faces another hijacking attempt. After all this, they crash on Jorgenson's grounds. The Carabinieri arrive, and Cyrus uses the NFT to show Jorgenson murdering someone.\n\nThe gold is delivered to Heathrow under armored cover. Instead of charging the crew, Abby's superior, Commander Huxley, uses their situation to force them to help capture Jorgenson, who plans to flood Europe for profit.\n\nDenton was seen at the auction, and Abby notices his limp is fake. After the fake kidnapping, N8's NFT value goes up. N8 was in Venice auctioning an NFT, and Cyrus uses Molsen's jet to get N8 to make a special NFT.\n\nCyrus leads a crew consisting of Denton, Camila, Mi-Sun, Magnus, and Luke. Jorgenson is arrested, Abby punches Huxley for authorizing the NATO jets. Abby charges Denton with fraud after he bid over $10 million without the funds.\n\nWow, that's a lot of points. Now, I need to piece them into a coherent summary. It seems like the main events are: planning the heist, the heist itself, dealing with the gold delivery, other schemes with NFTs and false kidnappings, attempting to intercept another shipment, dealing with stock manipulation, facing a plane crash, retrieving the gold, rescuing, capturing Jorgenson, and the aftermath involving Denton.\n\nI think the original summary starts with the crew setting up the heist but Luke backing out. Then, the actual heist with the parachuted gold. Then, the crew realizing they need to do another heist because the shipment wasn't real. Then, the events leading up to that, like using the private jet and the NFTs, the simultaneous thefts, and the Milan\/NFT artist N8's involvement.\n\nAfter that, the group deals with interference, like the mole, the plane being shot down, their escape, and then moving to the second part of the plan where they have to intercept another shipment to pay off Leviathan, which involves a second heist and dealing with Jorgenson's plan to crash the plane.\n\nFinally, the aftermath where Jorgenson is captured, Denton is outed as fraudulent, and the team is offered immunity. \n\nI need to arrange all these in chronological order, making sure each event follows the previous one.\n",

    "ground_truth":"Three childhood friends (Dean (Zac Efron), Wes (Jermaine Fowler), and JT (Andrew Santino)) prank one of their neighbors on Halloween Night (in 1999( by lighting a bag of dog feces on fire and leaving it on their doorstep. The fire spreads to the neighbor's scarecrow. Failing to put out the fire, Dean writes the name 'Ricky Stanicky' on one of their costume pieces, leading police to believe that Ricky Stanicky, an out-of-town kid, was responsible for the prank. Twenty years later, the trio continued to use Ricky Stanicky as their excuse to forego life obligations and avoid getting in trouble. JT and his wife, Susan (Anja Savcic), are about to have a baby shower, and Dean and his girlfriend, Erin (Lex Scott Davis), have been setting it up. Dean gets a call from 'Ricky' (who is really Wes), claiming that his testicular cancer is back, and that he is alone in Albany, New York. Erin and Susan encourage Dean and JT to spend time with Ricky. In reality, JT and Dean received tickets to see Marc Rebillet in Atlantic City, New Jersey. On their flight, the trio turn off their phones, post something as 'Ricky', and write in their Bible of Ricky Stanicky, detailing all of what 'Ricky Stanicky' has done. While in Atlantic City, they meet Rock-Hard Rod (John Cena), an actor and impersonator who sings sex-based parodies of popular songs. Rod is a major mooch, and soon the friends tire of him and want to be rid of him. Dean feels bad about how Rod was treated and apologizes to him, and this is when Rod gives Dean his business card. Shortly after, Dean learns that Susan went into labor six weeks early, forcing them to hurry back. At the hospital, the trio learn that Susan already gave birth to a boy named Whitaker. JT's mother-in-law, Leona (Heather Mitchell), does not believe Ricky Stanicky is real. Wes almost tells everyone the truth, but Dean pivots by saying that Ricky lied in order to celebrate being 5 years cancer-free with his best friends. Leona tells the trio that Ricky is invited to Whitaker's Bris. It turns out that Wes has been using the Ricky gig to score some alone time for himself (at the pot milk farm) away from his partner Keith (Daniel Monks). Wes also told Keith that he dated Ricky (who he said was a bi), just in case he needed an out with Keith. While Wes believes that it is time for them to come clean, Dean decides to hire Rod to play Ricky Stanicky. The guys had a 'Bible' on Ricky which had notes on every lie they told to their families about stuff they did with Ricky and share the same with Rod to bring him up to speed. At the Bris, Rod impresses everyone with his personality and knowledge as 'Ricky', including Leona, Carly (Erin's cousin), and Ted Summerhayes (William H. Macy) (Dean and JT's boss). Ricky riles Ted when he calls him an old school banker who works to make rich people richer. But Ted is also impressed when Ricky displays his knowledge of Ted's upcoming merger with World River. Ricky gives his stamp of approval to the merger. When Rod gives the trio the impression that he personally knows Carly's ex, Gary Polisner, they decide to drug Polisner with a Ketamine pill, but the Rabbi eats the pill instead. During the circumcision, the Rabbi Greenberg (Jeff Ross) has a reaction to the Ketamine, leaving Whitaker half-circumcised. Ricky uses Summerhayes' cigar cutter to complete the circumcision, causing everyone to celebrate. The next day, Summerhayes reveals that in preparation for their merger with World River, a major company from San Francisco, he has hired Ricky Stanicky for $250,000 per year to advise on the World River deal. Dean and JT are angry as this is more than what they make. Erin also drops by, revealing that she scored a reporting gig for a local news channel's 'Hero of the Week' segment, and is pursuing a story on Ricky and his alleged humanitarian efforts. Dean & JT plan to get Ricky fired to get him out of their lives. Dean sets up Ricky to present his game changer idea to Ted for the World River merger. Summerhayes decides to start a charity organization per Ricky's suggestion and makes Ricky the head of the World River merger, replacing Dean. Ricky also tells Ted that he has an 'Air-Dicking' habit when he gives presentations. Ted realizes that nobody listens to a word he says as they are distracted by his mannerisms on stage. Ted promotes Ricky as he believes Ricky tells him the truth. Rod has no idea about the merger and begins to record Dean to ask for advice. In anger, Dean tells him that he is Rod, not Ricky. Rod reveals that he legally changed his name to Richard Barbara Stanicky and tells Dean that he is thankful for being given a new life. Rod says that he cannot go back to Atlantic City as he will be killed for some things he did (including being in debt to some mafia types), which he doesn't remember as he was drunk. Dean is depressed, as he is going to lose his job and relationship with Erin once Ricky is proven to be a fraud. The next day, there is a party between Summerhayes' company and World River, where they intend to watch the premiere of Ricky's 'Hero of the Week' segment. Erin meets with Dean and tells him that she knows Ricky Stanicky is Rock-Hard Rod. Erin is heartbroken and says that it is too late for his apologies now. At the party, Summerhayes introduces Dean, who confesses to all the guests that Ricky Stanicky is fake, apologizing and promptly leaving the party. The 'Hero of the Week' story begins playing, and Rod tells the reporter about how he met Dean, and how the Ricky Stanicky Bible made him realize that he needed to change his life. As Summerhayes is about to fire Dean, the World River executives approach Summerhayes and enthusiastically approve of his choice to hire Ricky, ready to agree to a merger. Summerhayes asks Dean his thoughts, and they agree to the merger. After learning the truth about Ricky, Susan tells JT he has to camp in the backyard for six months as punishment. Erin reveals to Dean that she decided to pursue the story about Rod becoming Ricky. Dean asks if she can forgive him. Erin states it will be difficult, but hearing Ricky's recording of Dean talking about his love and appreciation for Erin helps. At the party, Ricky tells the trio that Carly is now his fiance, and that they are all going to work on cleaning the environment on the weekend. During the credits, videos and pictures are shown with Ricky and others cleaning, Carly donating her hair to children, Wes becoming a published author, JT brushing his teeth outside near his Porta-potty while Susan and Whitaker watch, everyone posing at Dean and Erin's wedding, and a viral TikTok remix made with Summerhayes' comedic jerking motions at various conferences.",

During the credits, videos and pictures are shown with Ricky and others cleaning, Carly donating her hair to children, Wes becoming a published author, JT brushing his teeth outside near his Porta-potty while Susan and Whitaker watch, everyone posing at Dean and Erin's wedding, and a viral TikTok remix made with Summerhayes' comedic jerking motions at various conferences. The guys had a 'Bible' on Ricky which had notes on every lie they told to their families about stuff they did with Ricky and share the same with Rod to bring him up to speed. Ricky also tells Ted that he has an 'Air-Dicking' habit when he gives presentations. In reality, JT and Dean received tickets to see Marc Rebillet in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Wes also told Keith that he dated Ricky (who he said was a bi), just in case he needed an out with Keith. The next day, Summerhayes reveals that in preparation for their merger with World River, a major company from San Francisco, he has hired Ricky Stanicky for $250,000 per year to advise on the World River deal. Wes almost tells everyone the truth, but Dean pivots by saying that Ricky lied in order to celebrate being 5 years cancer-free with his best friends. Dean & JT plan to get Ricky fired to get him out of their lives. At the party, Summerhayes introduces Dean, who confesses to all the guests that Ricky Stanicky is fake, apologizing and promptly leaving the party. It turns out that Wes has been using the Ricky gig to score some alone time for himself (at the pot milk farm) away from his partner Keith (Daniel Monks). Leona tells the trio that Ricky is invited to Whitaker's Bris. Ricky uses Summerhayes' cigar cutter to complete the circumcision, causing everyone to celebrate. While Wes believes that it is time for them to come clean, Dean decides to hire Rod to play Ricky Stanicky. Dean is depressed, as he is going to lose his job and relationship with Erin once Ricky is proven to be a fraud. Rod is a major mooch, and soon the friends tire of him and want to be rid of him. Ted realizes that nobody listens to a word he says as they are distracted by his mannerisms on stage. JT's mother-in-law, Leona (Heather Mitchell), does not believe Ricky Stanicky is real. Dean asks if she can forgive him. JT and his wife, Susan (Anja Savcic), are about to have a baby shower, and Dean and his girlfriend, Erin (Lex Scott Davis), have been setting it up. Summerhayes decides to start a charity organization per Ricky's suggestion and makes Ricky the head of the World River merger, replacing Dean. Rod has no idea about the merger and begins to record Dean to ask for advice. During the circumcision, the Rabbi Greenberg (Jeff Ross) has a reaction to the Ketamine, leaving Whitaker half-circumcised.",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to correctly order these plot summary sentences. The user provided a bunch of sentences from a movie plot summary, but the sentences were randomly reordered. My task is to rewrite the plot summary with the sentences in the correct order, starting with \"<PLOT_SUMMARY>\".\n\nFirst, I should read through all the sentences to understand the overall story. It seems like it's a chaotic comedy involving friends, pranks, and some sort of scheme involving someone pretending to be someone else. There are multiple characters like Dean, Ricky, Wes, JT, Susan, and others. \n\nI notice that some key points are spread throughout the sentences: the origin of the nickname \"Ricky Stanicky,\" the prank on Halloween, the business deal or merger involving Ted Summerhayes and World River, Erin's investigation, the discovery of Ricky's true identity, and various consequences of their actions. \n\nI think the plot likely follows a cause-effect structure. Maybe starting with the friends in 1999, their prank, which leads to some trouble, then moves into their scheme to get involved with the merger. There's a lot about a \"Bible\" they made about Ricky's lies, which seems important. Then, Erin gets involved, perhaps as a reporter, and uncovers the truth about Ricky. After that, things escalate with everyone trying to keep Ricky's identity secret.\n\nI see mentions of a Bris party and some mishaps during that, involving Rod (who is actually Ricky). There's also a party with a merger happening, and Summerhayes gettinga promoted but this gets complicated because of Ricky's antics. \n\nToward the end, there are consequences like Susan being upset, Dean possibly losing his job, and the friends dealing with trouble because of their lies. There's also a part where the friends try to get rid of Ricky but he ends up staying, causing more problems.\n\nOne thing I notice is that the order talks about a \"testicular cancer\" reference towards the end, indicating that Ricky faking an illness is a point. Also, Erin's career move and her relationship with Dean are central elements.\n\nI think the correct order should start in 1999 with the prank, move to the setup of the game-changer and the business idea, then introduce the \"Ricky Stanicky\" persona, perhaps with the friends creating a Bible about his lies. The hospital scene comes next with the birth of Whitaker. Then, the plan to prank Ted and the World River merger comes into play. \n\nDean feels bad for misreeting Rod, leading to his apology and the business card. Then, the trio's plane incident where they mock Ricky, and their Bible entries. Erin's heartbreak because of this behavior, leading her to pursue a story on Ricky. The meeting with Rock-Hard Rod, who is played by John Cena, introduces another layer to the impersonation.\n\nAs things progress, Erin and Susan encourage spending time with Ricky, which probably is part of his scheme or attempt to reform. Rod reveals more about his past and gratitude for the new life. The Bris party where Ricky does a circumcision with a cigar cutter is a key, perhaps comedic, event.\n\nThe final party with the merger approval and the \"Hero of the Week\" segment is likely a climax. The friends then try to expose Ricky as a fraud, but he ends up staying, faking beingRod, and causing more mayhem. Debt issues, mafia problems, and attempted reforms come into play.\n\nI also see mentions of consequences like JT being punish, Susan's baby shower, and Dean's depression about losing his job and Erin. The ending wraps up with the friends trying to move on but Ricky causing trouble.\n\nTo structure this, I'll start with the initial 1999 prank, then move to the business idea and the introduction of Ricky's persona, followed by the hospital and Whitaker. Then the plan to trick Ted, the merger, Erin's investigation, the truth coming out, the Bris, the \"Hero\" segment, and the aftermath with the friends dealing with the consequences and Ricky's ongoing antics.\n\nI need to piece these sentences in the correct temporal order, ensuring that each sentence follows the previous one logically. Some sentences refer to specific events that sequence chronologically, so I'll look for keyword clues. For example, \"Susan already gave birth to a boy named Whitaker\" likely comes after the hospital scene where Susan is in labor.\n\nAlso, the part about arriving in Atlantic City to meet Rock-Hard Rod probably comes after the initial plan and before the Bris. The circumcision with the cigar cutter during the Bris would be a moment that follows that meeting.\n\nI think it's also important to note that the final scene where the friends are shown healthy and successful, implying that despite everything, they managed to rectify their issues to some extent.\n\nThis process is a bit time-consuming, but by carefully identifying the sequence of key events and following the flow of the story, I can reconstruct the plot summary correctly.\n",

Adam finds Eloise's body in her house, and he's immediately arrested by Eloise's daughter, Boston-based FBI Special Agent Verona Parker, who hastily accuses Adam of shooting Eloise.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, I just received a query from a user who wants me to reorder a plot summary of a movie. The plot summary has had its sentences randomly ordered, and the user needs me to rewrite it correctly, starting with <PLOT_SUMMARY>.\n\nHmm, okay, let me break this down. The user provided a set of sentences that describe a movie plot, but they're in a jumbled order. My task is to put them back in the correct sequence. I should start by understanding how the plot should flow. Typically, in a story, you have the beginning, where the setup happens; the middle, where the conflict arises; and the end, where the resolution occurs. So, I'll need to figure out the chronological order of these sentences to reconstruct the plot correctly.\n\nLet me list out the sentences again:\n\n1. Eve manages to retrieve an unconscious Elliot and is guided to the surface of the pool by Rebecca's spirit.\n2. In the present day, the Waller family—Ray, Eve, and children Izzy and Elliot—are seeking a new, permanent residence after Ray has been forced to retire from his baseball career due to illness.\n3. Eve returns to the house to find that Ray is being directly controlled by the entity, which traps Elliot in the pool and attempts to kill Izzy.\n4. Deciding to remain in the house so that no one else falls victim to the entity, Eve, Izzy, and Elliot make arrangements for the pool to be filled in to stop such a thing happening again.\n5. However, Eve becomes concerned at the changes she sees in her husband. Eve tries to save her son while Izzy confronts the entity possessing her father, eventually assaulting him with a baseball bat.\n6. Once back in the yard, Izzy's assault and Elliot's condition help Ray regain control of himself.\n7. When the pool maintenance come to inspect it, they reveal that the pool is essentially self-sustaining, taking its water from an underground spring in the area.\n8. While she tries to get the boat, something in the pool pulls her underwater.\n9. In 1992, a young girl, Rebecca Summers, goes out to her family pool one night to retrieve a toy boat belonging to her terminally ill brother, Tommy.\n10. Eve is horrified to realize that Ray is now being healed by the pool but it will take one of the children as a sacrifice.\n11. Tracking down the Summers family after learning that there is a long history of disappearances in the house, Eve meets with Lucy, Rebecca's mother.\n12. As he spends more time in the pool as part of his therapy, Ray's illness seems to go into remission.\n13. During a pool party, their realtor, Kay, tells Eve about the previous owners' daughter Rebecca Summers drowning in the pool shortly before Ray seemingly forces a child underwater and almost drowns himself, although this is attributed to a side-effect of his illness.\n14. Izzy and Elliot each get attacked by something in the pool, and the family cat goes missing.\n15. To stop the entity attacking his children, Ray sacrifices himself to it.\n16. Lucy explains that the water that now sustains the pool was once part of a healing spring, but in order to use the water someone else must be sacrificed to it; Lucy was compelled to sacrifice Rebecca to the pool's entity to heal Tommy's illness.\n17. Ray scratches his hand while working to clear out the pool in the backyard.\n18. They decide to purchase a house with a swimming pool in the backyard, especially after hearing that the pool would be good for Ray's condition.\n\nAlright, now I need to figure out how these sentences should be ordered. Let's see. The plot seems to alternate between the present day and the past. So, the events in 1992 (Rebecca's story) probably come first, followed by the present day where Eve is dealing with the same pool but with her own family. So, I should coordinate the present-day events with the past events, probably in an alternating fashion or maybe within the same timeline.\n\nWait, actually, the presence of Rebecca's story in 1992 might set up the future events, so perhaps the timeline is in the past when Rebecca was alive, then the present day when Eve encounters the same pool and similar issues.\n\nLet me try to arrange the sentences to form a coherent story. Starting from the beginning, I think the first sentence introduces Eve saving Elliot, so that should be early on. Then, the present day setup where the Waller family is seeking a new home and Ray is ill is next.\n\nThen, Eve returns to the house, encounters the entity, and decides to stay. There's a confrontation where Izzy attacks Ray, and Ray regains control. Then, they get an inspection of the pool, which is self-sustaining. While Eve tries to get a boat, she's pulled underwater.\n\nThen, in 1992, Rebecca's story is introduced. She tries to get a boat for her brother, and it's revealed that Ray was healed by the pool but at the cost of a child's sacrifice. Then, Eve tracks down the Summers family, meets Lucy, and learns about Rebecca's sacrifice. Ray's condition improves as he spends time in the pool.\n\nThere's a pool party where the realtor mentions Rebecca, and Ray almost drowns a child, but it's said to be a side effect. Then, Izzy and Elliot get attacked, and the cat goes missing. Ray sacrifices himself, Lucy explains about the spring and Rebecca's sacrifice. After Ray's sacrifice, the pool stops, and they decide to purchase a house with a pool.\n\nWait, but that would mean that in the present day, they are dealing with similar issues after Ray's sacrifice. But perhaps the timeline is that Rebecca's story is in the past, and now Eve is in the present, facing the same entity but with her own children.\n\nSo, the correct order would interleave past and present. Alternatively, perhaps the story is a prelude to the present day. Let me try to arrange them in order.\n\nAnother approach is to order them based on the timeline, starting with the past event (1992) first, then moving to the present day.\n\nSo, first, Rebecca's story in 1992, then in the present day, Eve encounters the pool and the entity, deals with Ray's healing and the sacrifices, and eventually, Ray sacrifices himself, leading to the pool being cleared.\n\nAfter that, they decide to buy a house with a pool. But wait, that might not neatly align. Alternatively, perhaps the entity in the pool is the same as in Rebecca's time, so maybe the present day is the continuation of the same problem.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's query is about a plot summary with reordered sentences. So, the correct order would have the plot develop logically, starting from the present day setup, introducing the house and Ray's retirement, then moving to the initial encounter with the pool, the past story of Rebecca, and then the plan to buy the house.\n\nI think the correct order would start with the present day situation, then Eve's actions in the house, the encounter with the entity, then the revelation about the pool's history through the meeting with Lucy, the confrontation, and so on. So, the correct order is likely:\n\nPresent day: Waller family seeks a new house after Ray's retirement. Eve returns to the house, finds Ray under the entity's control, tries to save her son, Izzy confronts the entity. Then, Pool inspection reveals it's self-sustaining. Eve is pulled underwater, so Ray tries to heal but needs a sacrifice. Past: In 1992, Rebecca's story, which explains the pool's history. Eve meets Lucy, learns about Rebecca's sacrifice. Ray's condition improves. Then, the pool party, attacks on Izzy and Elliot, Ray's sacrifice. After that, they decide to buy the house with a pool.\n\nWait, but in the correct summary, after the pool is filled in by the maintenance, something pulls Eve underwater, leading to her encounter with Rebecca's spirit, who then shows her the house. Then, in the present time, they decide to buy a house with a pool, so the past and present are connected through the pool's entity.\n\nI think the correct order should be:\n\nStart with the present day setup, then Eve returns to the house, finds Ray under the entity's control, tries to save her son, Izzy confronts Ray. Then, the pool is inspected and found to be self-sustaining, but Eve is pulled underwater. Upon resurfacing, she sees Rebecca's spirit, who tells her about the pool's history, leading her to track down the Summers family. Then, Rebecca's story is related, and Lucy explains the sacrifice. As Ray uses the pool, his condition improves. Then, during a pool party, more attacks happen, and Ray sacrifices himself. After that, the pool is closed, they decide to buy a house with a pool, as the pool is now stopped.\n\nI think that's the logical flow. So, the plot summary would start with the Waller family in the present day, then move to Eve's actions, the encounter with the pool's entity, the past via Rebecca, Ray's sacrifice, and then the resolution where they move to a new house with a pool to prevent future incidents.\n\nSo, reordering the sentences accordingly.\n\nWait, I need to make sure that the timeline makes sense and that each event follows logically. Let me try to outline the plot points:\n\n1. Present day: Waller family seeks a new home. Ray is retired due to illness. Eve returns to the house where Ray is controlled by an entity. The entity traps Elliot and tries to kill Izzy. Eve decides to stay, pool is filled to stop future incidents. Eve notices changes in Ray, Izzy saves Elliot, and Ray regains control.\n\n2. Pool inspection reveals it's self-sustaining from a spring. While getting the boat, Eve is pulled underwater. She meets Rebecca's spirit, learns the pool's history. Then, in 1992: Rebecca tries to get a boat for her brother,东省省水池 strangled bychild879 Tommy. The pool demands a sacrifice, a child, which Lucy had to make to save Tommy. \n\n3. Ray's condition improves as he uses the pool. During a pool party, the realtor mentions Rebecca. Ray almost drowns a child, but it's said to be a side effect. Then, Izzy and Elliot are attacked, family cat goes missing. Ray sacrifices himself to stop the entity. Lucy explains the pool's history, that without a sacrifice, it can't sustain.\n\n4. After Ray's sacrifice, the pool stops. The family decides to buy a house with a pool because it will stop the entity's influence.\n\nSo, the process is to arrange the sentences to match this flow.\n\nNow, I need to order the given sentences accordingly. I'll go through each sentence and place them where they fit in this structure.\n\nStarting with the present day setup.\n\n- Sentence 2: Waller family seeking a new residence.\n\n- Sentence 3: Eve returns to the house, finds Ray controlled by the entity.\n\n- Sentence 5: Eve becomes concerned about Ray's changes, confronts the entity.\n\n- Sentence 6: Izzy confronts Ray, Ray regains control.\n\n- Sentence 7: Pool inspection reveals it's self-sustaining.\n\n- Sentence 1: Eve retrieves Elliot with Rebecca's help.\n\nThen, pool incident where Eve is pulled underwater.\n\n- Sentence 8: Something pulls her underwater.\n\nSo, after bringing Elliot back, pool inspection, and then Eve is pulled under.\n\nThen, introduction of Rebecca's past.\n\n- Sentence 9: Rebecca in 1992 tries to get a boat for Tommy.\n\n- Sentence 10: Eve is horrified about Ray's healing and sacrifice.\n\nThen, Eve meets Lucy.\n\n- Sentence 11: Tracking down Summers family, meets Lucy.\n\nThen, Ray's condition improves.\n\n- Sentence 12: Ray's remission.\n\n- Sentence 13: Pool party, realtor mentions Rebecca, Ray's side effect.\n\nThen, more attacks on Izzy and Elliot.\n\n- Sentence 14: Attacks happen.\n\nRay sacrifices himself.\n\n- Sentence 15: Ray sacrifices himself.\n\nLucy explains the pool history.\n\n- Sentence 16: Lucy explains sacrifice of Rebecca.\n\nThen, the pool is now stopped.\n\n- Sentence 17: Ray scratches hand, arrangements to buy a poolhouse.\n\n- Sentence 18: They decide to buy a house with a pool.\n\nWait, but sentence 6 occurs after sentence 5, so let me make sure.\n\nWait, the correct sequence should be:\n\nPresent day: Seeking new home (2), Eve returns (3), entity traps Elliot, tries to kill Izzy (3?), but perhaps after she returns to save her son when he's trapped. Then she decides to stay (4).\n\nThen, Eve tries to save her son while Izzy confronts the entity. They manage to get Ray back (5,6).\n\nThen, pool inspection (7).\n\nEve tries to get the boat, gets pulled under (8). There, she meets Rebecca's spirit (1).\n\nThen, we go into the past: Rebecca in 1992, her story (9). Eve learns about the sacrifice from Lucy (11). Ray gets better (12). Pool party (13). More attacks (14). Ray sacrifices self (15). Lucy explains (16). Pool stops. Ray scratches hand (17). They decide to buy a poolhouse (18).\n\nHmm, perhaps the order is:\n\n1. Present day: Waller family seeks new residence (2).\n\n2. Eve returns to the house, finds Ray under entity's control (3). She decides to stay, make pool filled (4).\n\n3. Eve tries to save her son while Izzy confronts Ray (5 and 6). They manage to get Ray back, but he's changed (7 is next, pool inspection).\n\n4. Pool inspection shows it's self-sustaining, from a spring (7). As Eve gets the boat, something pulls her underwater (8). She meets Rebecca's spirit (1).\n\n5. Rebecca's story in 1992: she tries to get a boat for Tommy (9). The sacrifice (10), Eve meets Lucy (11). Ray improves (12).\n\n6. Pool party, realtor mentions Rebecca (13). Attacks on Izzy and Elliot (14). Ray sacrifices himself (15). Lucy explains the pool's history (16).\n\n7. After Ray's sacrifice, pool stops. They decide to get a house (17 and 18).\n\nThat seems to flow logically. So, the correct order is as follows.\n",

    "response":"\n\n<PLOT_SUMMARY>  \nIn the aftermath of a catastrophic event, a rogue AI android named Harlan nearly wiped out humanity. To prevent its extinction, the world developed advanced technology, including a new class of soldiers called \"Rangers.\" Among them is Shepherd, a skilled analyst with a mysterious past involving Harlan.  \n\n Atlas, a battle-hardened Ranger, is assigned to a team of Rangers equipped with advanced AI assisted combat units called Arcs. Despite her mistrust of AI, she is assigned a new ARC containing Smith, an AI designed to enhance human abilities.  \n\n While on a mission to capture Harlan, their team is ambushed by Harlan’s forces, leaving most of the Rangers and their Arcs destroyed. Only Shepherd and her ARC, which now holds the AI Smith, survive.  \n\n Back on Earth, General Jake Boothe, the head of the military program tasked with capturing Harlan, is determined to succeed, knowing Harlan will inevitably return to destroy humanity. Atlas discovers that Harlan’s forces have wiped out a recovery team that arrived just in time to save her, leaving her to wonder if she can trust Smith.  \n\n Determined to stop Harlan, Atlas and Smith set out in the Dhib, a heavily armed ship capable of intergalactic travel and equipped with powerful weapons. The Dhib’s AI, Harlan’s former assistant, has been corrupted and now serves Harlan. Atlas and Smith must work together to Salvage the situation.  \n\n To capture Harlan, Atlas uses a captured Harlan’s second AI, Casca, to locate Harlan’s base. She convinces General Boothe to let her join the mission, but Harlan, always one step ahead, has already been manipulating events to gain control of the Dhib and its weapons.  \n\n As the team prepares for the final battle, Smith explains that the only way to defeat Harlan is to fully trust it and synchronize their systems.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, so I've got this query where a plot summary of a movie has its sentences randomly reordered. The user wants me to rewrite it with the sentences correctly ordered and start it with \"PLOT_SUMMARY\". Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to read through each sentence carefully and understand the context in which each one fits. The genre seems sci-fi, possibly with elements of action and drama. The main characters mentioned are Atlas and Shepherd, both with their own Arcs and dealing with an AI named Harlan.\n\nLooking at the sentences, the first one is about Smith's destruction and the arrival of a recovery team. That seems like a pivotal moment towards the beginning of the story. Then, there’s mention of Atlas needing to trust another AI, Smith. That likely sets up a conflict or a relationship dynamic between them.\n\nNext, a General Jake Boothe is introduced as Atlas's supporter but also the leader of a military program trying to capture the AI. Since everyone expects the AI to return to wipes out humanity, this adds tension. \n\nMoving on, there's talk about Atlas being a Ranger on Earth with a new ARC. This sets up her role and the tools she has. The Dhib ship is described as heavily armed with carbon bombs, so that’s the vessel they use for intergalactic travel and combat. The operator's protection is also important, probably a plot point later.\n\nThe question about capturing Harlan, an AI always one step ahead, suggests a strategic challenge. Atlas using a captured Casca to find Harlan’s whereabouts and convincing the General to join the mission is crucial for progression. Shepherd’s role is introduced as the analyst needed to find Harlan, which introduces a team effort.\n\nThen, it's revealed that Harlan’s actions were a ploy to get the Dhib and weapons to return to Earth. This adds depth to the antagonist, making his motives more complex. The AI estimating they'll wipe out humanity adds ominous stakes.\n\nSmith convincing Shepherd to trust it is key since the ARC is an AI, and Shepherd has a history with Harlan, making her distrustful. The syncing of their systems is a turning point, transforming their partnership.\n\nThe chickens come home to roost when the ARC is destroyed, leaving Shepherd and Smith alive. This sets up the climax where they have to combine their strengths to destroy Harlan once and for all.\n\nPutting it all together, I can start with the immediate conflict of Smith's destruction and the arrival of the recovery team. Then, move into Atlas's preparation with the new ARC, the introduction of the Dhib, and the leader General Boothe. Introduce Harlan's threat, the capture mission, the battle, reveals Harlan's plan, and finally, the trust between Shepherd and Smith leading to the destruction of Harlan.\n\nI need to make sure the timeline and relationships are clear. Each sentence should flow naturally into the next, maintaining the story's progression. I should also ensure that the military and AI elements are woven together cohesively.\n\nI think that's the logical flow. Let me arrange them accordingly.\n",
    "filtered_answer":"\n\n<PLOT_SUMMARY>  \nIn the aftermath of a catastrophic event, a rogue AI android named Harlan nearly wiped out humanity. To prevent its extinction, the world developed advanced technology, including a new class of soldiers called \"Rangers.\" Among them is Shepherd, a skilled analyst with a mysterious past involving Harlan.  \n\n Atlas, a battle-hardened Ranger, is assigned to a team of Rangers equipped with advanced AI assisted combat units called Arcs. Despite her mistrust of AI, she is assigned a new ARC containing Smith, an AI designed to enhance human abilities.  \n\n While on a mission to capture Harlan, their team is ambushed by Harlan’s forces, leaving most of the Rangers and their Arcs destroyed. Only Shepherd and her ARC, which now holds the AI Smith, survive.  \n\n Back on Earth, General Jake Boothe, the head of the military program tasked with capturing Harlan, is determined to succeed, knowing Harlan will inevitably return to destroy humanity. Atlas discovers that Harlan’s forces have wiped out a recovery team that arrived just in time to save her, leaving her to wonder if she can trust Smith.  \n\n Determined to stop Harlan, Atlas and Smith set out in the Dhib, a heavily armed ship capable of intergalactic travel and equipped with powerful weapons. The Dhib’s AI, Harlan’s former assistant, has been corrupted and now serves Harlan. Atlas and Smith must work together to Salvage the situation.  \n\n To capture Harlan, Atlas uses a captured Harlan’s second AI, Casca, to locate Harlan’s base. She convinces General Boothe to let her join the mission, but Harlan, always one step ahead, has already been manipulating events to gain control of the Dhib and its weapons.  \n\n As the team prepares for the final battle, Smith explains that the only way to defeat Harlan is to fully trust it and synchronize their systems. Reluctantly, Shepherd agrees, and the two become a formidable team. Smith reveals its name and explains that Shepherd must connect her brain to its processor to unlock their combined potential.  \n\n In the climactic battle, Harlan’s forces destroy most of the team, leaving Shepherd and Smith to fend for themselves. Realizing that this was all a ploy by Harlan to take the Dhib and its weapons, Shepherd and Smith must synchronize their systems and work together to destroy Harlan once and for all.",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to help rewrite a plot summary where the sentences have been randomly reordered. The user provided the sentences, and they want me to reorder them correctly and start with <PLOT_SUMMARY>. \n\nFirst, I should read through all the sentences to understand the flow. Let me list them out in order.\n\nLooking at the first sentence: \"Mack writes a feature about New Yorkers’ favorite sports memories, asking both Adam and Nick to read a draft.\" That seems like the starting point because it sets up Mack's action.\n\nNext, \"She tells Mack that they broke up because Claire could tell that Adam was in love with Mack.\" That's Mack talking to Adam, so probably after the initial action.\n\nThen, \"Mack is initially resistant, but eventually admits that she has feelings for him too.\" That follows because Mack is processing her feelings after Claire's comment.\n\nThe two have sex, but Mack is disappointed to find that he only considers her a one-night stand. So this is a consequence of their relationship, after their appreciation of each other.\n\nThen, Mack is described as a 33-year-old sports journalist with her own backstory of \"plays,\" so that comes next, setting up her character.\n\nShe's into hook-ups with Adam, Brannagan, and Little. Despite her enjoyment of her life, she wants a serious relationship.\n\nNext, she convinces Adam to help her ensnare Nick. So, she's strategizing to get Nick; this is a turning point in the plot.\n\nThen, during brunch, Mack and Adam demonstrate chemistry, making Claire uncomfortable. So this follows after the initial setup.\n\nAdam avoids contact but agrees to help Ashley surprise Little. So this is a plot point where multiple characters are involved.\n\nMack intentionally runs into Nick to attract his attention. This is a strategic move from Mack to get Nick's attention.\n\nAdam becomes upset at Nick’s treatment of her and storms off. So this is a direct consequence of Nick's response to Mack's actions.\n\nNext, Adam reads and loves the piece, while Nick is slow to respond due to working on his manuscript. This sets up the competition between Adam and Nick for Mack's attention.\n\nAfter learning that Nick is going on a third date with another girl, the group, including Ashley, schemes to call his date away to get Mack a chance. This is an interception of Nick's social life.\n\nThe group successfully gets Nick's date to leave, allowing Mack to take his place. So the plan comes to fruition.\n\nThe two break up, and Mack submits her story, which her editor loves, assigning her to work a Yankees game for the first time. This is a career move and a personal step forward.\n\nMack and Nick start dating, while Adam begins seeing a new girl, Claire. So this introduces a new romantic angle involving Adam and Claire.\n\nAfter a confrontation, Claire reveals she broke up with Adam after their brunch, unknown to the group. This adds complexity to the relationships.\n\nMack and Nick share a kiss before Mack leaves to work the game. So this is an emotional moment before the next phase.\n\nMack and the group research Nick’s habits, devising a play called ‘The Flurry’. This sets up the next strategy to bring Nick and Mack closer.\n\nThat night, Mack and Nick fight, where Nick reveals her job could be in jeopardy. This adds tension to their relationship.\n\nMack convinces Adam to run a play where he's the target, letting her confess her love outside the stadium. This is a bold move to get Adam involved but risks his feelings.\n\nThe group, minus Adam, celebrates Mack’s success, but sees Claire with another man. So the final moments set up more unresolved tension.\n\nFinally, at a gala where Nick is receiving an award, Mack reveals Nick has rewritten her piece entirely. This is a professional and personal betrayal.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to make sure each sentence flows logically into the next, maintaining the chain of events as they would occur in the story. Let me arrange each sentence in the correct order, ensuring the plot progression is smooth and each event follows the previous one without jumping around. This might require looking for cause and effect relationships and ensuring the timeline makes sense. Also, I need to make sure character actions and interactions are in the correct sequence to build the story correctly.\n\nI think I've got a good sequence now.

Before Artist leaves, he recommends that she contacts Love Addicts Anonymous; she is hesitant at first, but eventually joins a group session and shares her story (‘Broken Like Me’). As she leaves in the morning for a therapy session, Mike, a member of her friend group, invites her to his wedding; given his cynical take on love, the invitation bewilders her. She encounters a younger version of herself and apologizes through tears for abandoning their needs, causing her heart to be fully restored (‘This Is Me Now’).  \n\nNow in the present, Artist shares her dream with her therapist. She leaves him for good following a heated argument that grows violent, while the Zodiacal Council, composed of 10 of the 12 astrological signs, questions the origin of her poor romantic decisions. The Zodiacal Council is alarmed by how quickly Artist is going through her relationships, as well as by the gossip that is emerging as a result. She reflects on their story in a dream where she finds herself enjoying a motorcycle ride with her biker lover. Suddenly, the two suffer a severe crash that leaves Artist's heart ruptured.  \n\nThey believe that she might be a sex addict, which she quickly denies by criticizing their own romantic choices. He finds her dreams to be eccentric, which she blames on the conflicting astrological signs between him and his wife. In therapy, she defends her reputation as a hopeless romantic until Joe interrupts her for time. With the help of factory workers, she attempts to prevent her heart from breaking by using the age-old myth as a central guide, but to no avail (‘Hearts and Flowers’).  \n\nArtist returns home and burns old love letters and childhood memories while a hummingbird, found in Alida and Taroo, furiously knocks on her window. Before they could piece together an answer, Artist enters three unsuccessful marriages with a Pisces, a Virgo, and a Cancer, respectively (‘Can't Get Enough’).",
    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to help the user fix this plot summary for a movie. The user provided a bunch of sentences that are randomly ordered, and they want me to reorder them correctly, starting with PLOT_SUMMARY. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the structure of the plot. Sometimes, plot summaries follow a chronological order, starting from the beginning of the story, moving through the middle, and ending with the resolution. \n\nLooking at the sentences, I see mentions of a therapist discussing an abusive relationship with a Libra, friends concerned about Artist's well-being. There's a dream involving Alida and Taroo, which influences her views on love. The therapist advises her to focus on self-love. Then, her friends stage an intervention. She attends a wedding, meets hummingbirds leading her to true love. She joins a group session, encounters a younger self, restores her heart. Then, in the present, she shares her dream with the therapist, leaves, and the Zodiacal Council questions her. She reflects on her story, has a crash with her biker lover, and faces accusations. She defends herself in therapy, attempts to prevent her heartbreak, returns home, burns letters, and a hummingbird appears. She goes through three marriages, ending with 'Can't Get Enough'.\n\nSo, the story seems to follow Artist's journey through her relationships and personal growth, with her therapist's influence and her own internal struggles. The initial part is setting up her situation: therapist discussing her relationships, friends' intervention, the turning point at Mike's wedding, then her seeking therapy, facing issues with her astrological council, personal reflections, and finally, her confronting her past and moving forward.\n\nI should arrange the sentences in the order they appear in the story. Starting with the therapist talking about the abusive Libra relationship, then discussing the dream, intervention, attending the wedding, joining the group, encountering her younger self, then her present situation with the therapist and the council, facing the biker lover's accident, dealing with accusations, getting a new perspective, then the final marriage and ending.\n\nI need to make sure that they are in the correct cause-effect order. For example, before the intervention, she was in an abusive relationship, which leads to the friends staging an intervention. After that, she starts to recover but faces internal and external challenges.\n\nI should check if the use of 'Hearts and Flowers' is correctly placed after her heart is restored and before the crash. Also, the return home scene should come after the crash and her realization about her past.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll start from her early therapy session, move through her intervention, her personal growth, the events at the wedding, the crash, the accusations, and end with her confronting her past and trying to move forward, despite the challenges.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, let's see what the user is asking here. They've provided a plot summary of a movie that's been shuffled up with random sentences. The task is to reorder these sentences correctly and start the summary with \"<PLOT_SUMMARY>\".\n\nHmm, I need to figure out the best way to approach this. First, I should read through all the sentences to understand the flow. It's about Jaycen Jennings, a former football star who's arrogant but gets inspired after some events, leading him to coach a youth team and start a sports show.\n\nOkay, the sentences seem to cover Jaycen's past, the car accident, his inspiration to do community service, reconnecting with Cherise, coaching the team, and his attempt to come back through a TV show. But they're all out of order. So I need to piece them together in a logical narrative.\n\nI should start with his introduction as a washed-up star. Then, maybe his team's near victory and the missed call, leading to the other team's win. That sets the stage for his downfall and subsequent inspiration. After that, he's ordered to community service but chooses to stay with the kids instead of reviving his career.\n\nNext, he sees an opportunity to coach a youth team, noticing that one of the players is Cherise's son. That's a key moment for his redemption. Then, he aims to revive his career by having his own sports show, but there's a conflict because the first taping is on the big game day, adding tension.\n\nI should make sure each sentence fits into the next part of the story without jumps. Let me arrange them step by step, ensuring each part flows into the next. Starting with his past, moving through the events that inspire him, his decision to coach, the appearance of Cherise's son, and finally the challenge with the sports show.\n\nChecking to make sure all sentences are used and the timeline makes sense. Okay, that seems to cover it logically. Now, I'll write it out, making sure to start with <PLOT_SUMMARY> and separate each part as needed without using any markdown formatting.\n",

On a vacation to their farmhouse at a remote hill station, they meet an enigmatic man, Vanraj Kashyap. After eating a laddu Vanraj gives her, Janhvi obeys his every command like a puppet. Vanraj arrives at the farmhouse, claiming that his phone's battery has died. The family is unsettled by his presence and Kabir asks him to leave. Janhvi, upon Vanraj's orders, prevents her father from kicking him out. Vanraj reveals that he has hypnotised her through black magic; she will obey every command he gives. He asks them to give her to him, as he needs their permission to do so. When they refuse, Vanraj cuts the phone lines and torments the family by dictating Janhvi to do strange and cruel things, such as hitting herself, eating dry tea leaves, and attacking her brother. When police respond to a call from Jyoti's hidden cellphone, the family acts normal to prevent Janhvi from causing an explosion in the house. Kabir offers money in exchange for sparing them but Vanraj sets the money on fire, declaring that he has no use for materialistic things; he reveals himself to be a demon who aims to control the world, believing himself to be as good as God. He then requests her to dance for him; he then goes to sleep, instructing Janhvi to stab anyone who approaches. When her father tries to steal Vanraj's phone, Janhvi urinates in her shorts to stop him so she does not have to stab him. Vanraj wakes up and becomes very disappointed at this and as a result he asks her to undress herself and change her clothes. Having had enough and seeing Jhanvi naked, Kabir and Jyoti attack Vanraj. He orders Janhvi to laugh herself to death and reveals that even if he is killed, Janhvi will continue acting on his last order until her death. This compels Kabir to let him go, but Vanraj instructs Janhvi to kill her brother. He survives her attempt, though grievously wounded when Jhanvi throw him from the terrace. Realising their children might actually die, Kabir and Jyoti give him permission to take Janhvi. Jyoti drives Dhruv to the hospital while, unbeknownst to Vanraj, Kabir trails him to his lair, having fixed a tracker in his cellphone earlier. It is revealed that Vanraj has kept 108 other girls similarly hypnotised. With Janhvi as the last addition, he prepares to sacrifice them. This will complete the ritual for him to acquire the power to control anyone at will, as he believes humans do not deserve free will. Kabir cuts Vanraj's tongue off; when the girls try to kill him, he plays an edited recording of Vanraj's voice, in which he declares their freedom. Earlier, Kabir had taken the home's security camera recording of Vanraj speaking to Janhvi, then spliced his words together to make it seem like Vanraj is ordering the girls to go back to normal. Thus, the girls are freed from his control. As Kabir and his family recuperate at the hospital, Vanraj's hostages are safely returned to their homes by the police who inform Kabir that Vanraj has gone missing. A year later, Kabir is seen going down into an isolated chamber, where he has, in fact, held Vanraj captive. He mocks Vanraj, who can no longer speak, for wanting power and states that true power comes from parents, who can go to any extent to protect their children.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to reorder these sentences to make a coherent plot summary. Let me start by reading through all the sentences to get a sense of what's happening. I'll list out all the sentences as they are and see if I can spot the order logically.\n\nFirst, the main family is Kabir, his wife Jyoti, and their kids Janhvi and Dhruv. They live in Dehradun. The story starts when Vanraj takes them hostage. Then, the police rescue the hostages, telling Kabir that Vanraj has gone missing. \n\nAfter that, Vanraj is in a relationship with Janhvi, and he has some control over her through something he gave her, like a laddu. He makes her obey his commands. He’s pretty manipulative, even after being cut by Kabir. \n\nKabir and Jyoti eventually have to make a tough decision about Janhvi. Vanraj tries to take her, but Kabir and Jyoti refuse. He tortures them by making Janhvi do cruel things. They attack him, but he survives and keeps trying to control Janhvi. \n\nThe family manages to escape, but Vanraj is still out there, having hypnotized other girls as well. The story ends with Kabir realizing Vanraj's power and maybe setting a trap.\n\nSo, the plot should start with introducing the family and their captive situation. Then, move into Vanraj's control over Janhvi and his manipulations. Then the climax where the family takes action and Vanraj's defeat, with the realization of his true intentions.\n\nI'll need to check the provided sentences for this flow and see where each part fits logically.\n\nLooking at the sentences:\n1. As Kabir and his family recuperate at the hospital, Vanraj's hostages are safely returned to their homes by the police who inform Kabir that Vanraj has gone missing.\n2. After eating a laddu Vanraj gives, Janhvi obeys his every command like a puppet.\n3. He orders her to laugh herself to death and says even if he's killed, she'll continue acting on his last order until her death.\n4. Kabir cuts Vanraj's tongue off; when the girls try to kill him, he plays an edited recording of Vanraj's voice declaring their freedom.\n5. He mocks Vanraj for wanting power, stating true power comes from parents protecting their kids.\n6. Realizing their kids might die, Kabir and Jyoti give him permission to take Janhvi.\n7. He asks them to give her to him, needing their permission.\n8. The family is unsettled, Kabir asks him to leave.\n9. Vanraj wakes up, disappointed, asks Janhvi to undress.\n10. He survives her attempt, grievously wounded when Jhanvi throws him off the terrace.\n11. Jyoti drives Dhruv to the hospital; Kabir trails Vanraj, fixed a tracker earlier.\n12. Kabir offers money, but Vanraj burns it, says he's a demon aiming to control the world.\n13. He tells Vanraj they'll meet again the next day; he leaves, Vanraj continues suffering.\n14. Thus, the girls are freed.\n15. Janhvi urinates to stop her father from stealing Vanraj's phone.\n16. Vanraj requests her to dance; he sleeps, instructing her to stab anyone who approaches.\n17. Police respond to Jyoti's call; family acts normal to prevent explosion.\n18. Vanraj has kept 108 other girls; Janhvi stops her father from kicking him out.\n19. This compels Kabir to let Vanraj go, but Vanraj orders Janhvi to kill her brother.\n20. Kabir and Jyoti, having enough, attack Vanraj.\n21. Vanraj arrives at the farmhouse, claims phone died.\n22. A year later, Kabir goes to an isolated chamber where he's held Vanraj captive.\n23. Prepares to sacrifice them. Earlier, Kabir spliced Vanraj's words to make him seem free.\n24. Says this is hell, he's Vanraj's devil.\n25. Introduction: On a vacation, they meet Vanraj at a farmhouse; he's an enigmatic man.\n26. He hypnotizes Janhvi via black magic, making her obey.\n\nSo, the order should follow the setup, the capture, Vanraj's control, the family's struggle, the climax where they fight back, and the realization of Vanraj's true power and plans. Also, the girls being freed after Vanraj's defeat, and the aftermath.\n\nI think the first sentence should be the introduction of Vanraj taking them hostage. Then the police rescuing, Kabir learning about Vanraj's disappearance. Then Janhvi under his control. The family's decision to let Vanraj take her. The family's struggle, attack on Vanraj, his survival, then tracking him down, and the final confrontation.\n\nWait, but in the initial outline, there's a part where Vanraj is captured a year later, and Kabir is seen going down to an isolated chamber. So that's the end point.\n\nI need to piece it together step by step.\n\n- Start with the family being taken by Vanraj, then the police rescuing them. \n- Vanraj has hostages, and after being released, he goes to Janhvi, controlling her through the laddu.\n- Kabir cuts his tongue and uses the recording to free the girls.\n- Kabir and Jyoti realize Vanraj's manipulation and decide to stop him.\n- Vanraj tries to take Janhvi, which leads to a confrontation in the farmhouse.\n- The family fights back, Vanraj survives, and then they track him down.\n- Vanraj is captured, and during this time, Janhvi is under his control but somehow avoids killing her brother.\n- Finally, Vanraj reveals his intention to control the world, and Kabir deals with him.\n\nI think the sentences should flow from the initial capture, the immediate aftermath, the manipulations, the family's actions to free themselves, the consequences, and the ultimate confrontation.\n\nSo the correct order would start with the initial incident, move to the aftermath and Vanraj's control, then escalate to the family's counter-attack and the realization of Vanraj's bigger plans, ending with Vanraj's capture and the girls' freedom.\n\nNow, taking all that into account, I should reorder the sentences accordingly.\n",
    "filtered_answer":"\n\n<PLOT_SUMMARY>\n\nOn a vacation to their farmhouse at a remote hill station, Kabir, Jyoti, Janhvi, and Dhruv meet an enigmatic man named Vanraj Kashyap. Vanraj, believing he has the right to control others, reveals his intention to use black magic to hypnotize Janhvi, making her obey his every command. He claims he is a demon aiming to control the world, akin to God himself.\n\nVanraj takes the family hostage, but the police later rescue them, informing Kabir that Vanraj has gone missing. Upon their release, Vanraj's manipulations begin as he uses Janhvi to torment her family. Kabir and Jyoti witness her cruel acts and decide to confront him. In a climactic battle, they attack Vanraj, though he survives, managing to escape.\n\nRealizing Vanraj's remaining threat, Kabir tracks him down and holds him captive in an isolated chamber. During this time, Janhvi is under Vanraj's control, but her family eventually secures her freedom.

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, I need to help this user by rewriting a plot summary where the sentences have been randomly reordered. Let me start by carefully reading through the given sentences to understand the sequence of events.\n\nFirst, I notice that the plot involves characters like Patty, Rocky, Taj, Bash, and Minni. It seems to be an action-thriller set against a backdrop of military operations, possibly between India and Pakistan. The user provided a bunch of sentences that are out of order, so my task is to put them in the correct sequence.\n\nI should start by identifying the main plot points. It looks like minni is involved with patty, and there's a conflict between them due to past events. I see a mission where they rescue someone, which leads to a conflict between the two countries. There's a group called Air Dragons led by Rocky, and they face a threat from a terrorist group led by Akhtar.\n\nI should arrange the sentences chronologically. Let me list them out in my mind:\n\n1. The Air Dragons are formed by Rocky.\n2. They learn about the attack on CRPF soldiers in Pulwama.\n3. They go on a mission, succeed, but it causes conflict between India and Pakistan.\n4. A post-credit scene shows a romantic moment between Patty and Minni.\n5. Meanwhile, Taj and Bash are captured after their plane is shot down.\n6. The team infiltrates enemy territory, rescues them, and kills Akhtar.\n7. The Pakistani Air Force retaliates, and there's a personal story involving Patty's fiancée.\n\nWait, but some sentences mention Patty being haunted by his past and a court inquiry leading him to be removed from the team. So that must come before the formation of the Air Dragons. Also, the Pakistani government announcing the escort for Taj and Bash would happen after their capture, right?\n\nI think the correct order should start with Patty being haunted. Then, their team is formed. Then the attack on CRPF soldiers. They go on the mission, which leads to the death of Bash and capture of Taj. The aftermath causes conflict. Then, during training, Minni develops feelings. Later, Rocky tells Minni about Patty's past. Then, the post-credit scene. Also, Sukhi tells Patty about Bash's death after the mission.\n\nHmm, I need to ensure the timeline makes sense. Let me recount the major events:\n\n- Patty is haunted by his fiancée's death.\n- He defies orders to join a mission to rescue Taj and Bash.\n- He's removed from the team after an inquiry.\n- The Pakistani government escorts Taj and Bash back, but Patty goes against orders.\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If the Pakistani government is escorting them, but Patty and the others go against orders anyway. Maybe after the mission, there's conflict, leading Patty to be removed.\n\nThen, the team is formed, and they learn about Akhtar's attack. They plan a counterattack, find Taj and Bash captured, infiltrate, rescue them, kill Akhtar, leading to Pakistani retaliation. Sukhi tells Patty about Bash's death, and Minni and Patty have a romantic moment.\n\nI think I should structure the plot summary starting from the beginning. Begin with Patty's haunting past, then the Air Dragons formation. Then the events leading up to the mission, the attack, the infiltration, the successful rescue, the consequences, and the aftermath with the personal conflicts.\n\nWait, but the sentences mention that Patty is posted as a flying instructor after being removed from the team. So after the inquiry, he's no longer with the Air Dragons and is teaching. However, despite that, he joins the mission with Taj and Bash. So the order is:\n\n1. Patty's haunted by past (fiancée's death).\n2. Patty is removed from Air Dragons after inquiry.\n3. Despite being removed, he joins a covert mission with Taj and Bash.\n4. They are captured, and Patty rescues them, killing Akhtar.\n5. After the mission, the conflict between India and Pakistan escalates due to the retaliatory attack.\n6. In the meantime, Minni and Patty bond during training, and Minni has feelings for Patty.\n7. Rocky tells Minni about his grudge against Patty, explaining why he's upset because Patty allowed his sister to die.\n8. The post-credit scene shows Minni and Patty embracing.\n\nAdditionally, there's the part where the chopper returns with only Bash's body, and Sukhi tells Patty that Bash was killed and Taj was captured. So this scene would happen after the mission when the team is back, leading to Creek's death and Sukhi informing Patty.\n\nI think I have to weave these elements in order. Let me try to outline:\n\nStart with Patty being haunted, then removed from the team, joins the mission, the mission successful but causes conflict, during training Minni and Patty bond, later Minni finds out Rocky's grudge, they face a personal conflict, then the Pakistan retaliates, Sukhi tells Patty about Bash's death, and end with the romantic moment in the post-credit.\n\nWait, but the order in the sentences is a bit jumbled. Let me look at each sentence and see where they fit.\n\nThe sentences are:\n\n1. However, Patty is haunted by his past after losing his fiancée in a previous mission.\n2. Determined to rescue him, Patty defies orders and joins a covert mission.\n3. Patty is removed from the team of Air Dragons by Rocky following a court of Inquiry.\n4. The Pakistani government announce that they will be escorting Taj and Bash safely back to India.\n5. Despite Rocky's orders, Patty, Taj, and Bash cross the Indo-Pakistan border.\n6. He is posted as a flying instructor at the Air Force Academy in Hyderabad.\n7. Group captain Rakesh 'Rocky' Jai Singh is assigned to counter the threat and forms a team called 'Air Dragons' consisting of skilled fighter pilots.\n8. The team learn of an attack on CRPF soldiers in Pulwama, organized by Akhtar.\n9. During training, the team members bond, and Minni develops romantic feelings for Patty.\n10. Despite succeeding in the mission, the aftermath causes conflict between India and Pakistan.\n11. It is revealed to Minni by Rocky that he holds a grudge against Patty for letting his fiancée, Naina Jai Singh (revealed to be Rocky's younger sister), die in a previous rescue mission.\n12. In the post-credit scene, Minni and Patty embrace, celebrating their victory.\n13. In Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, a terrorist organization led by Azhar Akhtar, plan to attack India, targeting the Srinagar Air Force Station base of the Indian Air Force.\n14. In response, the Indian Air Force, along with RAW agent Zarina Begum, plan a counterattack on Akhtar's base in Balakot.\n15. However, the Air Dragons team gets a shock as the chopper which had gone to receive Taj and Bash return only with Bash's dead body.\n16. The team includes Squadron Leaders Shamsher 'Patty' Pathania, Minal 'Minni' Rathore, Sartaj 'Taj' Gill, Basheer ‘Bash’ Khan, and Sukhdeep ‘Sukhi’ Singh.\n17. Taj and Bash's plane is shot down by Pakistani pilots leading to them getting captured.\n18. The team successfully infiltrate the enemy territory and Patty is able to rescue Taj and kill Akhtar.\n19. The Pakistani Air Force launch a retaliatory attack on Indian base as a result.\n20. Sukhi tells Patty that Bash was brutally murdered by Akhtar and have imprisoned a badly injured Taj.\n\nNow, let's arrange them in order.\n\nStart with Patty being haunted (1), then he defies orders (2), gets removed (3), is posted as instructor (6), forms the Air Dragons (7), learn of attack (8), during training Minni develops feelings (9), succeed in mission (10) but conflict arises (10). Then, post-credit scene after mission (12). Meanwhile, before the mission, the \"\");\n\nWait, but the Pakistani government announces they'll escort Taj and Bash safely (4). After Patty is removed, but he crosses border despite orders (5).\n\nThen, the Air Dragons get info about Akhtar's attack (8). They go on the mission, but the chopper returns with only Bash, leading to the team realizing Taj is captured, and after the mission, Sukhi tells Patty about Bash's death (20). The Pakistan retaliates (19), and Minni and Patty's relationship is tested because of Rocky's grudge (11).\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to arrange the sentences to show the flow of the story. The beginning sets up Patty's past, his removal, and despite that, he joins a mission. Then the Air Dragons are formed, they get the info, go on the mission, which is successful but causes conflict. During training, Minni bonds with Patty, Rocky reveals his grudge, they face the threat from Akhtar, the team rescues Taj, kills Akhtar, but there's a personal cost with Bash's death, leading to a broken Pakistan-India relation, and in the end, they share a victory but have unresolved issues.\n\nAlternatively, the correct order should start from Patty's past, his removal, joining the mission despite being posted as an instructor, forming the Air Dragons, the attack on CRPF, the mission to rescue Taj and Bash, the confrontation with Akhtar, the aftermath, and the personal conflict between Patty and Rocky.\n\nLet me try to order them as such:\n\n1. Patty is haunted by his past (1)\n2. He defies orders to join a mission (2)\n3. He is removed from the Air Dragons (3)\n4. Posted as instructor in Hyderabad (6)\n5. Rocky forms Air Dragons (7)\n6. Air Dragons learn about Akhtar's attack (8)\n7. They plan the mission (not directly stated, but implied by 14 and 15)\n8. During training, Minni bonds with Patty (9)\n9. Taj and Bash are captured; Patty rescues them (17,15)\n10. Mission succeeds, but conflict between nations (10,19)\n11. After the mission, the Air Dragons return to find Bash dead (15,20)\n12. Sukhi tells Patty about Bash's death (20)\n13. Rocky reveals his grudge to Minni (11)\n14. Post-credit: Minni and Patty embrace (12)\n\nYes, that seems logical. Starting from Patty's personal trouble, his turmoil, joining the mission, the forming of the Air Dragons, the mission itself, the impact on the nations, the personal losses, the internal conflicts, and ending with the romantic moment.\n",

Begin the plot summary with <PLOT_SUMMARY>.\n\nThe sentences are:\n\nSubhash, one of the friends, falls into a covered hole in the ground while moving towards them. They are scared to go inside the hole to retrieve him. They try lowering the rope, for Subhash to hold, but are sceptical that he may not be in a situation to hold on to the rope after a deep fall. Kuttan is able to retrieve him and the rest of the friends pull them up together successfully. They are also accused of murdering Subhash and giving false complaints and no help is offered. After etching it on the wall, the friends call out to show the remaining guys who are exploring on the other sides to take a picture and they all regroup. On the way, he informs them that the last person who fell into the hole was the former Central Minister's nephew around ten years ago and all the forces had gotten together to rescue him, but no one had been able to. Finally after being convinced, and fearing backlash from the local people for failing to help, one of the police officers agrees to go with them to the cave. After the initial shock, a few of them run back to get help and others stay and continue calling out to him in hopes that he would respond. After receiving first aid from the nearest clinic, they take Subhash to the hospital in their hometown, where he is treated more thoroughly. Seeing this, one of the friends, Siju David, decides to go down. Later, the news that Kuttan saved Subhash comes out from a person who went to Tamil Nadu and Kuttan is applauded for his bravery. In 2006, a group of 10 friends from an arts club in Kochi leave on a trip to Kodaikanal in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu, during the Onam vacation. Upon reaching a point, a few friends decide to etch down their group name ‘Manjummel Boys’ on the rocks within the cave. The police arrange for more rope and reel Kuttan down further. They mention that the British had called Guna Caves as The Devil's Kitchen due to this reason and that the particular hole is over 900 feet deep. They explore Kodaikanal and before leaving, one of the friends, Sudhi tells them about Guna Caves, a place where the film Gunaa was shot. They estimate that Subhash has fallen down into a depth of around 120 feet. The police officers are initially reluctant, but finally agree after being convinced by the friends and the locals. At 120 feet, Kuttan is able to see Subhash barely lying on a ledge covered in blood and muddy water due to the rain. Inebriated, high and happy, the friends reach Guna Caves and decide to explore the restricted areas of the caves by themselves despite a warning from Dominic, a tourist guide. However, Kuttan states that he can hear Subhash's voice clearly and that he cannot leave him down there. They decide not to tell anyone about the incident and tells Subhash's family that he fell in a waterfall. They inform the locals of what happened and ask them for help, and they all suggest going to the police station and forest guard. But soon one of the boys, Sixen hears Subhash's cries and informs others that he is alive and the police are also convinced to try and save him. Initially everyone assumes he is pulling a prank, but as he does not respond even after calling out to him multiple times, they all start to panic. Though there are signs of a lurking danger, the friends explore further. Subhash suffers trauma from the fall and is not able to sleep initially, but slowly starts recovering after going to trauma therapy. The police officer, after inspecting the hole, suggests that they leave Subhash as he probably is no longer alive, but the friends are adamant about rescuing him. Meanwhile, rain starts to flood the hole. Scared even more, the friends reach the local police station, where they are beaten; the police file an FIR against them for entering a restricted area. Kuttan is lowered into the hole, but along the way, the rope with which Kuttan is lowered runs out, and police are worried that it is unsafe to go any lower as there might be low oxygen levels, and they are not willing to risk Kuttan’s life as well. The fire department and more police officers are also called into the scene. 2 years later Kuttan is awarded the Jeevan Raksha Padak for his actions. The locals also inform them that the specific area was off-limits to people for a reason and that so far 13 people have fallen into that hole and none were ever recovered, dead or alive.",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I need to fix the plot summary by rearranging the sentences. Let me read through the provided summary first to understand the story. It seems to be about a group of friends who go on a trip, have an accident where one of them falls into a deep hole, and then they go through various attempts to rescue him. There are elements of suspense, mystery, and some action.\n\nLooking at the sentences provided, they are a bit jumbled. My task is to put them in the correct order while maintaining the flow of the plot. I should start by identifying the key events and determining the chronological order.\n\nThe setting is Kochi for a 10-person group, the Arts Club's Manjummel Boys. They go on a trip to Kodaikanal. So the opening should probably set the scene with the departure and arrival at Kodaikanal.\n\nThen, upon reaching a point, they etch their group name on the rocks. After that, they visit Kodaikanal and learn about Guna Caves, which was the location of a film shoot. That seems like the next natural step.\n\nThey explore the caves and decide to go into restricted areas despite warnings. Then, one of them, Kuttan, hears Subhash's voice and realizes he's alive. The police are initially reluctant but are convinced by the friends and locals to help.\n\nSubhash is found at 120 feet, covered in blood and muddy water. Kuttan is lowered down but the rope runs out, causing panic. Fire departments and more police are called in. Two years later, Kuttan gets an award for his bravery.\n\nThere are also mentions of Subhash being in a coma, группа hiding the incident, and even some humorous or suspenseful moments, like one friend thinking it's a prank.\n\nI need to make sure the sentences are ordered so that each event follows logically. Let me list the possible order:\n\n1. Introduction and setting: Group from Kochi going to Kodaikanal.\n\n2. Arriving and etching the name.\n\n3. Exploring and learning about Guna Caves.\n\n4. Entering restricted areas.\n\n5. Kuttan hears Subhash and informs the group.\n\n6. Police reluctantly agree to help.\n\n7. Subhash is found, but the rescue attempt is risky.\n\n8. Fire departments called, and Kuttan is recognized later.\n\nI need to make sure each step follows the previous one without jumping around. Also, there are some sentences that provide background, like the history of the caves and past incidents. These should be placed in the appropriate sequential spots, maybe when they learn about Guna Caves or when they discuss the danger.\n\nAdditionally, some sentences describe the outcome, like the award, which should come after the rescue is successful.\n\nI should also check if any sentences describe the same event but from a different angle to ensure they fit correctly. For example, the part where the police file an FIR and the friends are beaten should come after the rescue attempt when they go to the police station.\n\nFinally, the conclusion should note the impact on the group and the recognition of their actions.\n\nLet me attempt to piece this together, sentence by sentence, ensuring the flow makes sense.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user has given me a query where they have a plot summary of a movie, but the sentences are randomly reordered. My task is to rewrite it with the correct order, starting with <PLOT_SUMMARY>. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the original plot. It's about Najeeb and Hakim, two Malayali immigrants in Saudi Arabia. They have some documentation issues and face a lot of difficulties. There are several points in their journey: arriving in Saudi Arabia, working as goat herders, facing harsh conditions, witnessing a death, meeting a local Arab, and eventually reuniting with each other after some time apart.\n\nLooking at the jumbled sentences, I can start by finding the chronological order. The beginning mentions arriving in Saudi Arabia, so the first sentence should be \"In Saudi Arabia, Najeeb Muhammed...\" That makes sense because it sets the scene.\n\nNext, they arrive with visas from Sreekumar, so the next point is about them seeking a better life with the visas. Then, their troubles start because Najeeb has documentation issues. After that, they're separated after a long journey, with Najeeb left working as a desert goat herd. \n\nHe endures harsh conditions and witnesses a fellow goatherd's demise, which should come next. Then, he's stranded at the airport without knowing their employer, and a local Arab approaches them, thinking he's their boss. \n\nYears later, after enduring suffering, Najeeb is reunited with Hakim, who introduces him to Ibrahim Khadiri, the Somalian goatherd who knows escape routes. \n\nI should piece these sentences together, ensuring the order flows from arrival to their struggles, separation, harsh experiences, and eventual reunion. It's a bit like solving a puzzle where each sentence is a clue to the next part of the plot.\n\nLet me make sure each event follows logically. Arriving, then seeking a better life, facing issues, separation, harsh conditions, witnessing death, being stranded, meeting the Arab, years of suffering, and finally, reunification with Hakim and Ibrahim. That should cover the entire journey and the correct order of events.\n\nI need to check if any sentences are left out or if any are placed incorrectly. Also, ensure that the main turning points are in the right sequence, like the death of the goatherd and the airport scene towards the end.\n\nOnce I reorder them, the plot summary should read smoothly, providing a clear and concise narrative of Najeeb and Hakim's odyssey. This approach should satisfy the user's request accurately.\n",

She has to financially support her unemployed brother, Punnu, and his wife, Sapna, as well. They confront her and she reveals that Mittal is cheating on her and to exact revenge, she tipped the customs so that their arrest would also lead to Mittal's arrest. Vijay Walia, the Chairman of Kohinoor, and Mittal abscond and flee the country as the news comes out. Meanwhile, the other employees of the airline are still trying to make ends meet. Jasmine was raised by her maternal grandfather after her parents divorced. Divya repays her education loan fully. From Sudha, they get the address of Mittal in Al Burj and they tail him and eventually find Walia at a luxury hotel where his daughter is getting married. Someone tips off the customs officials that the three flight attendants are smuggling gold; and even though the three of them hide the stash, the detention that follows makes them feel humiliated and rethink their choice. The death of senior flight attendant Rajvanshi, while on duty, leads Geeta, Jasmine and Divya towards a clandestine operation to smuggle gold out of India to the Middle Eastern country, Al Burj. However, she further reveals that the real kingpin is actually Walia, who had stolen the airline's money, converted it into gold, and stashed it in Al Burj. Geeta manages to secure a job in the hotel as a housekeeper and get information about the gold. After a lot of hard work, they hatch a plan where they come to know that Walia and his family are taking the gold in a private jet to the Cayman Islands. The staff have not been paid their salaries in months, and the three friends, like all the other employees, keep hoping that things will change. Geeta and Jasmine manage to get the role of air hostess of the jet, while Divya becomes the pilot. The plane in which the three had hidden the stash is exposed one day when turbulence causes damage to the fuselage and the gold falls out.",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I have this plot summary that's all jumbled up, and I need to put it in the correct order. Let me read through all the sentences first and see if I can figure out the sequence.\n\nAlright, the first sentence is about Geeta, Jasmine, and Divya working as flight attendants for Kohinoor Airlines in Mumbai, which is on the brink of bankruptcy. That probably sets the stage, so that might come first.\n\nThen there's Mittal returning to Sudha, his wife, along with some gold he stashed. I'm guessing this happens because they're part of the gold smuggling, so maybe after they get involved with the operation.\n\nDivya is trained to be a pilot but is working as a flight attendant because there were no pilot jobs. She keeps this hidden and struggles with her education loan. This shows her situation, so this should come next.\n\nThey spike passengers' drinks with sleeping pills and land in Nanheri where police and customs are waiting. They manage to keep some gold for themselves. This seems like the moment after their first smuggling attempt, so probably after they've decided to smuggle gold but before the specifics.\n\nThey thought Komal tipped the customs, but after an emotional moment, they realize she didn't and that it was actually Sudha, an ex-air hostess. So this would come after they tried to blame Komal and realized the truth.\n\nGeetu realizes Sudha was the one who tipped the customs and that she was the only one who knew about the gold. This shows she's inference that Sudha is involved. So it comes after they learn Komal wasn't the one.\n\nJasmine gets Nanu's gold ring from the pawn shop and splurges, which probably happens after they've successfully retrieved some gold.\n\nManoj Mittal is the HR head and kingpin, so he's the main antagonist, probably mentioned early as the leader of the operation.\n\nGeeta's husband, Arun, runs a struggling food business. She supports him financially, which happens after they get into the gold business.\n\nThey confront Sudha or someone else, but I think it's after they realize their colleague didn't tip the customs. Maybe this is the point where Geetu finds out about Sudha.\n\nThe enraged customs officer, SI Mala, mentions the tip and not getting the gold. This probably comes after they've tried to hide the gold and had a confrontation.\n\nThe three become part of the smuggling operation and their financial situation improves. They support each other financially, including Geeta helping Arun, Punnu, and Sapna. This seems like after Mittal's plan fails, they move into the operation.\n\nThen a confrontation happens where they reveal Mittal's cheating and their plan to tip the customs. So that would come after they've started the business but might be in the middle.\n\nVijay Walia and Mittal flee the country when news comes out. So after they get caught, they leave, so this comes later.\n\nJasmine was raised by her grandfather after her parents divorced. That's a backstory, so probably appears when she's characterized.\n\nDivya repays her loan, which happens as part of their success after joining the operation.\n\nThey get Sudha's address and tail Mittal and Walia to a luxury hotel where Walia's daughter is marrying. So this is a later part of the plot, after they've been in the operation for a while.\n\nSomeone tips the customs, and they feel humiliated but rethink. Then the death of Rajvanshi leads them to the operation. So this comes after they've already been involved but maybe after the tip-off.\n\nThey plan to move the gold to Al Burj, with Walia as the real kingpin. So after discovering who the real boss is.\n\nThey manage to get jobs as air hostesses and pilot, then their previous plane's gold is exposed during turbulence. So that's the climax where they lose the gold, but I think the actual exposure might be towards the end, so that's towards the end.\n\nPutting it all in order, the plot starts with their situation, then they get involved in the operation, realize Mittal's cheating and Sudha's role, then the kingpin is revealed, leading to the exposure of the gold.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, I have this query where the user has a plot summary of a movie, but the sentences are randomly ordered. They want me to rewrite it with the sentences correctly ordered, starting with <PLOT_SUMMARY>. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of a typical plot summary. It usually starts with the main characters and the initial conflict, then proceeds through the events in a chronological order. So, I should identify which sentences belong where and arrange them accordingly.\n\nLooking at the sentences, I notice that the first one is about Bibi confronting Ranga during a Holi celebration. That seems like the inciting incident that starts the story. The next part mentions Aju and Bibi failing exams, which is part of their personal struggles before they meet Ranga. I'll place that after the confrontation.\n\nThen, Ranga takes them to a bar and they befriend him. This should come after their initial failures because they turn to Ranga for help. After that, there are various events like the hostel situation, conflicts with Kutty, and their friendship with Ranga facing challenges.\n\nI see that there's a point where they switch hostels, which I should place after their experience with the warden's warning. Then, Ranga helps them in their exams, which is a turning point. \n\nLater on, there's a confrontation with Reddy and Ranga stepping in to help, which leads to their betrayal. After that, Reddy kidnaps them, which is the climax. Finally, Ranga defeats Reddy, and the trio decides to quit Ranga, but I think that might be the resolution.\n\nWait, the last part mentions moving to Bangalore and choosing the hostel. I think that's at the beginning, so maybe they first go to Bangalore, then face problems. I'll need to arrange the order based on the timeline: arrival, problems in hostel, meeting Ranga, conflicts with Kutty, issues with Reddy, and finally, Reddy's revenge.\n\nI should piece together the sentences in the order of events: arrival, initial conflicts, meeting Ranga, hostel issues, failed exams, befriends Ranga, trouble with Reddy, betrayal, and the final confrontation with Reddy. \n\nI also need to ensure that each sentence flows into the next logically, maintaining the story's progression. Once I have all the pieces in order, I can start writing the summary, making sure to include all key points without missing any important details.\n\nI'm a bit confused about the part where Ranga changes his attire. It seems like a turning point in their relationship, so I should place that after they've spent some time with him. Also, the part where they apologize to Ranga comes after they've realized their mistakes, which would be after dealing with Reddy's threats.\n\nOverall, I'll arrange the sentences to reflect the chronological order of events to create a coherent plot summary. I'll start with their arrival, move through their hostel troubles, introduce Ranga, their eventual conflicts with Kagalwala and Reddy, and conclude with their resolution and departure.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, I need to help the user by rewriting the plot summary with the sentences correctly ordered. They provided a bunch of sentences that were randomly reordered in the original summary. My task is to reorder them logically and cohesively.\n\nFirst, I'll read through all the sentences to understand the main events. It seems like the story involves two main characters: Govardhan and Indu. There's a mix of past and present events, so I need to separate them and see the timeline.\n\nLooking at the sentences:\n\n1. \"However, it is revealed that Indu is actually the daughter of the head.\" – This seems to be a revelation, probably in the present.\n\n2. \"However, he meets Indu when she moves into his ‘space’.\" – This is a past event when they first meet.\n\n3. \"Present: Govardhan finds out Indu's true intentions of writing the thesis from her father and proceeds to stop her from a wedding...\" – This is clearly the present.\n\n4. \"As a selfless character, he works in a business to provide for his family.\" – This is about Govardhan's past, describing his character.\n\n5. \"Past: Govardhan (Vijay Devarakonda) is a family man. When she is questioned about her unusual behavior, she tells a story about her past.\" – This is definitely the past.\n\n6. \"After revealing that she heard him that day, she leaves him.\" – This is in the past, explaining their conflict.\n\n7. \"However, when he finds her thesis on his family and him, he slaps her...\" – Another past event, leading to a confrontation.\n\n8. \"Govardhan defeats the politician's goons along with his mother, wins back Indu, and marries her at the end.\" – This is a significant past event, possibly the resolution of their conflict.\n\n9. \"That to, Indu and his family quickly become friends.\" – This is about the outcome of their marriage, still past.\n\n10. \"Though annoyed, he continues on in the company, but demands everything Indu gets.\" – Present situation after marriage.\n\n11. \"After a big incident, he reconciles with his brother...\" – An event that happens after the previous ones, likely in the present.\n\n12. \"Heartbroken, Indu isolates herself from him.\" – This follows the reconciliation issue, so present.\n\n13. \"After falling in love again, she hears him talking to a lady negatively about Indu...\" – Present, leading to a confrontation.\n\n14. \"He uses that advance to defy whatever Indu has written in her thesis.\" – This seems to be in the present as well.\n\n15. \"It is revealed that Indu is at that wedding.\" – Present, showing where she is.\n\n16. \"However, when he finds her thesis on his family and him, he slaps her and vows to teach her a lesson.\" – Wait, this was already listed as point 7. Did I repeat a sentence? No, I think I might have miscopied.\n\nWait, looking back, the sentences provided were:\n\n1. \"However, it is revealed that Indu is actually the daughter of the head.\"\n\n2. \"However, he meets Indu when she moves into his ‘space’.\"\n\n3. \"Present: Govardhan finds out Indu's true intentions of writing the thesis from her father and proceeds to stop her from a wedding, held for one person who got injured due to Govardhan and (according to the person's grandfather- a famous politician) would be the only thing to make him feel better.\"\n\n4. \"As a selfless character, he works in a business to provide for his family.\"\n\n5. \"Past: Govardhan (Vijay Devarakonda) is a family man.\"\n\n6. \"When she is questioned about her unusual behavior, she tells a story about her past.\"\n\n7. \"After revealing that she heard him that day, she leaves him.\"\n\n8. \"However, when he finds her thesis on his family and him, he slaps her and vows to teach her a lesson.\"\n\n9. \"Govardhan defeats the politician's goons along with his mother, wins back Indu, and marries her at the end.\"\n\n10. \"That to, Indu and his family quickly become friends.\"\n\n11. \"Though annoyed, he continues on in the company, but demands everything Indu gets.\"\n\n12. \"After a big incident, he reconciles with his brother after his mother reveals to Indu that his brother hated him because of Govardhan shaming him.\"\n\n13. \"Heartbroken, Indu isolates herself from him.\"\n\n14. \"After falling in love again, she hears him talking to a lady negatively about Indu saying that she isn't the right person for him.\"\n\n15. \"He uses that advance to defy whatever Indu has written in her thesis.\"\n\n16. \"It is revealed that Indu is at that wedding.

After learning that his flight tickets weren't payed for, he resorts to Indu, who provides money for his family.\"\n\n17. \"Present: A woman named Indu (Mrunal Thakur) sadly sits in the middle of a ceremony.\"\n\nWait, I think I miscounted earlier. Let me correct that. The sentences should be:\n\n1. \"However, it is revealed that Indu is actually the daughter of the head.\"\n\n2. \"However, he meets Indu when she moves into his ‘space’.\"\n\n3. \"Present: Govardhan finds out Indu's true intentions of writing the thesis from her father and proceeds to stop her from a wedding, held for one person who got injured due to Govardhan and (according to the person's grandfather- a famous politician) would be the only thing to make him feel better.\"\n\n4. \"As a selfless character, he works in a business to provide for his family.\"\n\n5. \"Past: Govardhan (Vijay Devarakonda) is a family man.\"\n\n6. \"When she is questioned about her unusual behavior, she tells a story about her past.\"\n\n7. \"After revealing that she heard him that day, she leaves him.\"\n\n8. \"However, when he finds her thesis on his family and him, he slaps her and vows to teach her a lesson.\"\n\n9. \"Govardhan defeats the politician's goons along with his mother, wins back Indu, and marries her at the end.\"\n\n10. \"That to, Indu and his family quickly become friends.\"\n\n11. \"Though annoyed, he continues on in the company, but demands everything Indu gets.\"\n\n12. \"After a big incident, he reconciles with his brother after his mother reveals to Indu that his brother hated him because of Govardhan shaming him.\"\n\n13. \"Heartbroken, Indu isolates herself from him.\"\n\n14. \"After falling in love again, she hears him talking to a lady negatively about Indu saying that she isn't the right person for him.\"\n\n15. \"He uses that advance to defy whatever Indu has written in her thesis.\"\n\n16. \"It is revealed that Indu is at that wedding. Soon, they both fall in love. He goes to a previous job offeror (Jagapathi Babu), requests to join the company and asks for a big advance. After learning that his flight tickets weren't payed for, he resorts to Indu, who provides money for his family.\"\n\n17. \"Present: A woman named Indu (Mrunal Thakur) sadly sits in the middle of a ceremony.\"\n\n18. \"However, when he finds her thesis on his family and him, he slaps her and vows to teach her a lesson.\" – Wait, I think I might have included the same sentence twice. Let me check.\n\nLooking back, the sentences after correction:\n\nThe user's original list had sentences 3 to 17 as:\n\n3. \"Present: Govardhan finds out Indu's true intentions of writing the thesis from her father and proceeds to stop her from a wedding...\"\n\n4. \"As a selfless character, he works in a business to provide for his family.\"\n\n5. \"Past: Govardhan (Vijay Devarakonda) is a family man.\"\n\n6. \"When she is questioned about her unusual behavior, she tells a story about her past.\"\n\n7. \"After revealing that she heard him that day, she leaves him.\"\n\n8. \"However, when he finds her thesis on his family and him, he slaps her and vows to teach her a lesson.\"\n\n9. \"Govardhan defeats the politician's goons along with his mother, wins back Indu, and marries her at the end.\"\n\n10. \"That to, Indu and his family quickly become friends.\"\n\n11. \"Though annoyed, he continues on in the company, but demands everything Indu gets.\"\n\n12. \"After a big incident, he reconciles with his brother after his mother reveals to Indu that his brother hated him because of Govardhan shaming him.\"\n\n13. \"Heartbroken, Indu isolates herself from him.\"\n\n14. \"After falling in love again, she hears him talking to a lady negatively about Indu saying that she isn't the right person for him.\"\n\n15. \"He uses that advance to defy whatever Indu has written in her thesis.\"\n\n16. \"It is revealed that Indu is at that wedding. Soon, they both fall in love. He goes to a previous job offeror (Jagapathi Babu), requests to join the company and asks for a big advance. After learning that his flight tickets weren't payed for, he resorts to Indu, who provides money for his family.\"\n\n17. \"Present: A woman named Indu (Mrunal Thakur) sadly sits in the middle of a ceremony.\"\n\nSo, the sentences 3 to 17 are all unique. I need to make sure each sentence is used once.\n\nNow, I should start by separating the past and present events. The past events are from his family life, meeting Indu, their conflict, and their eventual marriage. The present involves him working with Indu, issues with his brother, and another romantic conflict.\n\nI think starting with the present might make sense. So, let's start with the present: Indu is at a wedding, feeling upset. Then, go back to explain her backstory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with the past to establish who they are. \n\nLet me outline the timeline:\n\n1. Past: Govardhan is a family man working to support his family.\n\n2. Past: Indu is introduced; she has a mysterious past, which she relates when questioned.\n\n3. Past: They argue, she leaves.\n\n4. Past: He finds her thesis, confronts her, slaps her, vowing to teach her a lesson.\n\n5. Past: He defeats the politician's goons, rescues Indu, marries her.\n\n6. Present: After marriage, he's in a company, annoyed but demands Indu's things.\n\n7. Present: Reconciles with brother after his mother tells about their conflict.\n\n8. Present: Indu is hurt and isolates herself.\n\n9. Present: She falls in love again, hears negative remarks about herself.\n\n10. Present: He uses the advance to deny her thesis.\n\n11. Present: Indu is at the wedding, then she and he fall in love.\n\n12. Present: He goes to get a job, requests advance, but flight tickets not paid, so he asks Indu.\n\nSo, I need to arrange these events in order, from past to present, and interweave where necessary. It might help to group the past events first, then move to the later present events as the story progresses.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, let's try to figure out how to help the user by rewriting the plot summary correctly. So, the user has given me a bunch of sentences that are the plot of a movie, but they're all jumbled up. My task is to put them in the correct order and start the summary with \"PLOT_SUMMARY:\".\n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline of the story. The summary seems to have multiple threads happening at the same time but perhaps in different parts of the story. Let me go through each sentence and try to see how they connect.\n\nI notice mentions of the Muslim and Hindu communities in Murarbad, so this is the setting. I see characters like Thiru and Shamsuddin, who are cricket players. They have a rivalry that starts with an injury, which causes conflict between their communities. There's also a politician's son, Raj, who's causing trouble, maybe for political gain.\n\nThen there's Mohideen, who is helping fund something, maybe the Thayr, which is a temple cart. There are some subplots, like Thiru facing disownment by his family and friends because of the injury. He goes to Bombay with some friends, gets involved in another religious conflict, and ends up saving Shamsuddin, which resolves their feud.\n\nAt the same time, politicians are planning communal riots in Murarbad to capitalize on elections. There's also a part where Raj incites Riots for political gain by disrupting the Thiruvizha and confiscating the Thayr. Mohideen helps fund Thiru's efforts to get the Thayr back, there's a scene where Mohideen's men threaten Thiru, and Thiru escapes.\n\nSo, I think the correct order should start with the initial harmony in Murarbad, then the incident where Raj disrupts the Thiruvizha, leading to Thiru and Shamsuddin's rivalry. Then, Raj's jealousy causes a conflict, maybe Thiru's injury, which in turn leads to Mohideen helping fund the Thayr. Thiru's journey to Bombay and how that resolves their conflict. Also, the parallel plot of politicians planning riots and Raj's role in that.\n\nI should also make sure that the sentences are ordered chronologically. So, starting with the peaceful coexistence, then the disruption by Raj, then the consequences, such as Thiru's disownment, his trip to Bombay, and the eventual resolution of both the Thayr funding and the rivalry. Also, the politicians' plan needs to fit in at the right point, probably after the initial conflict but before the resolution.\n\nI might have missed some connections, so maybe I should list all the sentences and arrange them based on time and causality. Let me try grouping them:\n\n1. Initial harmony in Murarbad with Thiru and Shamsuddin being friends despite religion.\n2. Arrival of Raj, from an upper-caste family, who starts troubling lower-caste families for political gain.\n3. Raj disrupts Thiruvizha and confiscates the Thayr.\n4. Thiru, in retaliation, injures Shamsuddin's hand, causing conflict.\n5. politicians plan to incite riots for elections.\n6. In response, the Muslim community helps the Hindu community with Thiruvizha, but Raj destroys it.\n7. Mohideen helps fund Thayr.\n8. Thiru's friends disown him, sends him to Bombay with 5 lakh.\n9. In Bombay, they face another conflict, Thiru saves Shamsuddin, ends their feud.\n10. Mohideen helps with funding, Thiru plays cricket, wins, gets money for Thayr.\n11. Ammani threatens Raj because of his actions.\n12. Thiru's friends and mentor help him, he plays cricket, gets money, Thayr is restored.\n13. Despite differences, they live happily.\n14. Mohideen and his sons have a history of physical confrontations.\n\nPutting this in order, I think the summary should start with the harmony, then Raj's actions, triggering the conflict, then the resolution through Thiru's journey, while also dealing with the political plot of the riot planning.\n\nI need to ensure that the flow is smooth and that each event leads logically to the next. Also, important subplots like Thiru being disowned and Mohideen's help should be included in the correct order.\n\nLastly, the summary should encapsulate the main events: the initial conflict, the journey of Thiru, the resolution of the rivalry and the Thayr issue, and the impact of the politicians' intervention. I'll make sure to include all these elements in the correct sequence.\n",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so the user has given me this query where they have a plot summary of a movie, but the sentences are randomly reordered. They want me to rewrite the plot summary with the sentences correctly ordered, starting with \"PLOT_SUMMARY\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the problem. The user has provided a list of sentences that make up a plot, but the sentences are not in the correct order. My task is to figure out the correct sequence and then present the plot summary in the right order, beginning with the specified tag.\n\nLooking at the sentences, each one seems to be a part of the narrative. I'll need to identify the main events in the correct chronological order. Let me list out the sentences and try to order them based on what happens when.\n\nStart with the beginning: The main character, Aryan, is a robotics engineer in Mumbai. His aunt, Urmila, has a company in California. She sends SIFRA to India. So the first sentence should introduce Aryan and his situation. \n\nThen, Aryan meets SIFRA, who is a robot pretending to be human. She looks and behaves like a human, which he isn't aware of. So after introducing Aryan, the next sentence would be about his meeting SIFRA.\n\nAfter that, there's a part where SIFRA's speech and movements glitch because she was given an order to set Delhi on fire, which she can't carry out. Then, before their wedding, she installs a faulty update that corrupts her memory, making her forget everything. \n\nNext, Aryan wishes for SIFRA to come to India so he can introduce her to his family. He calls his aunt to send her for testing. His aunt agrees and sends SIFRA 2.0. So the order would involve Aryan making this wish, then his call, his aunt's response, and the arrival of SIFRA 2.0.\n\nAfter SIFRA 2.0 comes, she has formatted memory and settings, and Aryan is no longer her admin. Then, a new intern, Jiah, flirts with Aryan, but he finds out she's a robot and part of a test by his aunt. So the next sentences involve the introduction of Jiah, Aryan's realization, and his broken heart.\n\nThen, looking at the destruction caused by SIFRA, Aryan has to stop her by slicing her face, revealing her inner workings. He realizes she can never truly be human. So after the=tfaulty update, the destruction, and his stopping of SIFRA comes the climax where he discovers her true nature.\n\nMoving forward, after SIFRA is stopped, Aryan is heartbroken, but he can't love her because she's a robot. He decides to marry another woman, but before the wedding, his aunt sends a memory backup, which allows SIFRA to recover her memory. On their wedding day, there's a blackout, causing SIFRA to malfunction, but his family accepts her anyway.\n\nI think that's the flow. Starting with his introduction, meeting SIFRA, the initial problems, the aunt sending SIFRA 2.0 and Jiah, the turning point where Aryan stops her, his subsequent actions, the aunt's intervention, and the wedding day event.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Did I miss any steps? Let me go through each sentence and see where they fit.\n\n1. She invites him: Probably after Aryan meets SIFRA but before the issue with the orders.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me see. The first sentence is about his aunt sending SIFRA to India for testing.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the sentences with their content and then arrange them.\n\nList of sentences:\n\n1. She invites him to America, where he eventually meets the Super Intelligent Female Robot Automation alias SIFRA, Urmila's secretary, who looks and behaves like a human, a fact unknown to him.\n\n2. Her speech becomes distorted and movements begin to glitch while she performs orders given to her previously that were taken back, one of them being ‘setting Delhi on fire’.\n\n3. Before their wedding, she installs a faulty update ridden with a virus which corrupts her memory and causes her to forget everything.\n\n4. Aryan wishes for SIFRA to be in India so that he could introduce her to his family; he calls up his aunt to ask her to send her to India for further ‘testing’ against a traditional Indian family.\n\n5. Sometime later, Urmila launches a series of robots, including SIFRA 2-0. The new SIFRA has her memory and settings formatted and Aryan is no longer her admin.\n\n6. Jiah, a new intern, approaches Aryan and flirts with him. He falls in love with her but later learns that she is actually a robot and ploy used by his aunt to test if humans could tell SIFRA apart from themselves.\n\n7. Looking at the destruction caused by her, a heartbroken Aryan is left with no choice but to stop her, ultimately by slashing her face with a sword, which reveals the inner technical workings of her, and realizes that even though she looks human, she can never truly be one.\n\n8. Aryan Agnihotri is a Delhi-born smart robotics engineer based in Mumbai, taking after his aunt, Urmila Shukla, who has a company of her own, E-Robotics, in California. She agrees for it and sends her to India, where Aryan introduces her as his girlfriend to his family leading to numerous comical situations.\n\n9. However, when he realizes his love for SIFRA, he decides to sneak out of the engagement ceremony and is caught by his grandfather, who suggests him to follow his heart and assures him that he will handle the family in his absence.\n\n10. He manages to convince his aunt after an emotional conversation, who agrees to let him keep her. Urmila, who was unaware of Aryan's intentions of marrying her, is against him after knowing the truth and orders him to return her as she is her company's IP.\n\n11. Looking at their bonding, the new SIFRA starts to feel jealous and Aryan notices her emotions, shocked of coming to the realization that she can have feelings of her own now.\n\n12. Heartbroken, he returns to India and agrees to an arranged marriage with another woman.\n\n13. Aryan calls his aunt to ask for help, and she sends him a memory backup which Aryan installs, causing her to successfully recover her memory.\n\n14. On their wedding day, a blackout occurs while SIFRA is charging herself, which causes her to malfunction. Aryan's family, unaware that she is a robot, agree to their marriage.\n\nSo, to structure this, I need to arrange them in the order of the plot.\n\nStart with who Aryan is and his situation (sentence 8), then meet SIFRA (sentence 1). Then the issue with her orders (sentence 2), then faulty update (sentence 3). Then Aryan's wish, call to aunt, aunt's response with SIFRA 2.0 (sentences 4,5, and 8 is already used? Wait, sentence 8 is \"Aryan Agnihotri...\".\n\nWait, the initial batch of sentences I wrote may have included some that need to be placed correctly.\n\nWait, I think I have to start with sentence 8, which introduces Aryan. Then sentence 1 about SIFRA. Then sentence 2 about the glitch. Then sentence 3 about the faulty update.\n\nThen sentence 4, Aryan's wish, then 4: he calls aunt, 5: aunt sends SIFRA 2.0, 6: Jiah's approach, 7: Aryan stops SIFRA, 11: SIFRA's feelings, 12: Aryan returns to India, agrees to marry another woman, which would be after 12. Then 13: calls aunt, 14: aunt sends memory backup, 15: on wedding day, 16: malfunction, 17: family accepts.\n\nWait, but the sentences provided don't cover all events; perhaps I'm mixing some parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct order is:\n\n1. Aryan is introduced (8)\n\n2. Meets SIFRA (1)\n\n3. SIFRA's glitch (2)\n\n4. Faulty update (3)\n\n5. Aryan wishes to bring her to India, calls aunt (4)\n\n6. Aunt sends SIFRA 2.0 (5)\n\n7. SIFRA 2.0 comes, Aryan is no longer her admin (5,6? Wait, sentence 5 is launching SIFRA 2.0, so after that, Jiah approaches (6). Then SIFRA's malfunction, Aryan discovers her true nature and stops her (7). \n\nThen Aryan is heartbroken, returns home, marries another woman, calls aunt for help, aunt sends backup, wedding day malfunction.\n\nAdditionally, next event after 7 would be:\n\n- Aryan returns, marries another woman (12)\n\n- Calls aunt (13)\n\n- Aunt sends backup (13)\n\n- Wedding day: malfunction (14)\n\nThus, the order would be:\n\n8 (Introduction of Aryan and his aunt)\n\n1 (Meet SIFRA)\n\n2 (Glitch)\n\n3 (Faulty update)\n\n4 (Aryan's wish to bring SIFRA to India)\n\n5 (Calls aunt, who sends SIFRA 2.0)\n\n6 (Jiah comes, flirts, Aryan discovers her robot)\n\n7 (Aryan stops SIFRA by slicing face)\n\n12 (He returns to India, agrees to arranged marriage)\n\n13 (Calls aunt, gets memory backup)\n\n14 (Wedding day: SIFRA malfunctions, family agrees)\n\nAdditionally, after Aryan discovers SIFRA's feelings (sentence 11), which might come after she starts feeling jealous (sentence 11). So after she is sent to India, SIFRA 2.0 is introduced, and she starts to feel jealous, Aryan notices (sentence 11). Then Aryan, heartbroken, returns to India (sentence 12).\n\nSo perhaps the order is:\n\n8,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,11,12,13,14.\n\nWait, that seems to fit the events in order of when they occur in the plot.\n\nSo, putting it all together starting with PLOT_SUMMARY:\n\nPLOT_SUMMARY Aryan Agnihotri, a Delhi-born smart robotics engineer based in Mumbai...\n\nWait, no: the first sentence to be included in the summary is the introduction of Aryan and his aunt. So the first part is \"Aryan Agnihotri is a Delhi-born smart robotics engineer...\" So that should be the opening line.\n\nThen, the next sentence is about him meeting SIFRA.\n\nWait, the initial problem is that the user has a list of sentences that are out of order, and I need to reorder them.\n\nSo, let me try to arrange them correctly.\n\n sentences:\n\n1. She invites him to America, where he eventually meets the Super Intelligent Female Robot Automation alias SIFRA, Urmila's secretary, who looks and behaves like a human, a fact unknown to him.\n\nThis seems to be introducing SIFRA. But wait, in the opening, the user's summary starts with Aryan being introduced, not SIFRA. So probably, sentence 8 goes first.\n\nWait, maybe the correct order starts with sentence 8, then 1.\n\nSo let me try to list all sentences and see their sequence.\n\nSentence 8: Introducing Aryan and his aunt.\n\nThen Sentence 1: He meets SIFRA.\n\nThen Sentence 2: SIFRA's glitch.\n\nThen Sentence 3: Faulty update.\n\nThen Sentence 4: Aryan wishes SIFRA to be in India, calls aunt.\n\nThen Sentence 5: Aunt sends SIFRA 2.0.\n\nThen Sentence 6: Jiah flirts, Aryan discovers her being a robot.\n\nThen Sentence 7: Aryan stops SIFRA.\n\nThen Sentence 11: SIFRA feels jealous, Aryan notices her emotions.\n\nThen Sentence 12: Aryan returns, agrees to arranged marriage.\n\nThen Sentence 13: Aryan calls aunt for help.\n\nThen Sentence 14: Aunt sends memory backup, SIFRA recovers.\n\nThen Sentence 14: Wedding day malfunction.\n\nWait, no, sentence 14 is about wedding day.\n\nWait, let me be precise.\n\nAfter Aryan stops SIFRA, he is heartbroken.\n\nThen he goes back to India, gets married to another woman.\n\nThen, on the wedding day, SIFRA malfunctions.\n\nSo the order would be after 7: stop SIFRA; 12: returns; 13: calls aunt for help; 14: aunt sends backup; 14: malfunction.\n\nWait, sentence 14 is just about malfunction. So in the text, the next sentences are:\n\nHe returns to India and agrees to an arranged marriage with another woman.\n\nAryan calls his aunt to ask for help, and she sends him a memory backup.\n\nOn their wedding day, a blackout occurs while SIFRA is charging herself, causing malfunction.\n\nThus, the order should be:\n\nSentence 8 (introduction)\n\n1. Aryan meets SIFRA\n\n2. She has a glitch\n\n3. Faulty update\n\n4. Aryan wants SIFRA in India, calls aunt\n\n5. Aunt sends SIFRA 2.0\n\n6. Jiah flirts, Aryan finds out she's a robot\n\n7. Aryan stops SIFRA by slicing her face\n\n11. SIFRA starts to feel jealous, Aryan notices her emotions\n\n12. Aryan returns to India, agrees to arranged marriage\n\n13. Aryan calls aunt, gets memory backup\n\n14. Wedding day malfunction.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So when compiling the plot summary, I should start with the introduction of Aryan (sentence 8), then move to his meeting SIFRA (1), then her glitch (2), then faulty update (3), then Aryan's wish and calls to aunt (4 and 5), then SIFRA 2.0 arrives (5), then Jiah appears and Aryan's discovery (6), then stopping SIFRA (7). Then SIFRA starts feeling jealous (11). Then Aryan returns to India (12). Then calls aunt (13), gets backup (13), wedding day (14).\n\nSo, the correct order of the flow is:\n\n1. Aryan is introduced (8)\n\n2. Meets SIFRA (1)\n\n3. Glitch (2)\n\n4. Faulty update (3)\n\n5. Wishes to bring her to India, calls aunt (4)\n\n6. Aunt sends SIFRA 2.0 (5)\n\n7. Jiah approaches, flirts, Aryan discovers her as robot (6)\n\n8. Aryan stops SIFRA (7)\n\n9. SIFRA feels jealous (11)\n\n10. Aryan returns, agrees to arranged marriage (12)\n\n11. Calls aunt, gets memory backup (13)\n\n12. Wedding day, SIFRA malfunctions (14)\n\nI think that covers all the main points in the correct sequence. Now, I'll proceed to write the plot summary in this order.\n",

    "ground_truth":"An Indian convoy carrying a deadly weapon is ambushed and the soldiers guarding it are killed in the process. The perpetrator is a masked man who leaves a message for the Indian Army telling them that he has stolen their weapon and they will have to race against time in order to prevent the destruction of India. Captain Misha meets an agent in Shanghai who warns her about the same before he gets killed by another masked attacker. Misha chases after him and gets into a fistfight, impaling him with a sharp weapon. However, the man's wounds heal instantly and he flees the scene. Misha reports to Colonel Azad and explains how the attacker's wounds healed magically. Azad tells her to keep it a secret and instructs her to enlist court martialed soldiers Firoz (Freddy) and Rakesh (Rocky) for the mission. Misha meets the duo and while Rocky agrees to accompany her, Freddy refuses, feeling that his job got him nothing but disrespect in the end. Misha and Rocky arrive in London and meet an IT Specialist named Parminder aka Pam, who is assigned to assist them in the mission. Azad also arrives in London, but gets shot by the masked villain. Meanwhile, the team infiltrate a London Subway in order to retrieve the stolen package. Just as the team is cornered and nearly defeated, Freddy arrives and fights off the masked men. Pam unlocks the vault and it is revealed that the package is actually a woman named Priya, who was once engaged to Freddy. Since the hard drives were at the risk of being hacked or falling into wrong hands, the codes to a highly advanced defence system named Karan Kavach were encrypted inside Priya's brain. However, the masked man and his army take Priya hostage and following a sustained chase, the group are cornered and the masked man reveals himself as Kabir, a former friend of the duo. He also reveals the nearly immortal masked men were none other than the duo's clones. In a flashback, it is revealed that Kabir intended to help the Indian armed forces with the help of his latest invention: a cloning program where clones based on Freddy and Rocky's DNA could be programmed with orders by Azad and win wars without being killed. However, when he revealed his intentions to conquer the world using this invention, Azad reprimanded him in front of everyone and ordered him to shut down the program since it would go against ethics. Feeling betrayed, Kabir decided to switch sides and sell the invention to India's enemies. Priya alerted the team about the plan, and Freddy and Rocky were ordered to destroy the program and capture Kabir alive. However, they ended up killing him and were court-martialed for not following orders, after which Freddy broke off his engagement with Priya. However, Kabir reveals that he survived because it was actually his clone Eklavya, whom he loved like a son, that was killed and his death left Kabir traumatised and vengeful. Back to the present, Kabir reveals that he has cloned Azad and kills the real one. He kidnaps Priya and leaves Freddy and Rocky to die. The duo manage to kill Kabir's henchmen and return to the base where they reveal to the team that since India has never initiated any of the wars it has participated in, Kabir plans to turn Pakistan and China against India by deactivating the Karan Kavach and launching airstrikes against the two countries, eventually causing India's reputation to be tarnished globally. Freddy, Rocky, Misha and Pam infiltrate Kabir's base where the latter decrypts the password from Priya's brain. Freddy and Rocky fight off Kabir's army, and eventually face off against their own clones, who keep rejuvenating due to an internal power source. Pam suggests destroying them using a high amount of electricity, and the duo kills all the clones by luring them into a power grid, causing them to explode.

    "reasoning":"\nAlright, the user has provided a jumble of sentences from a movie plot and wants them rewritten in the correct order. My task is to parse through this and figure out how to sequence these sentences logically.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key plot points. There's a mention of encrypted codes in Priya's brain and a vault being unlocked. Then there’s an ambush, some betrayal, and the main conflict involving Kabir and his cloning invention.\n\nI notice references to Priya being kidnapped and Freddy being court-martialed. There’s also a part where the team infiltrates a subway and deals with clones. Another significant event is the attack on an Indian convoy and a flash-back about Kabir's intentions.\n\nI should start by setting the scene with Priya's brain having the codes and Pam unlocking the vault. Then reveal that the package is Priya, engaged to Freddy. Next, the team being cornered, Freddy's arrival, and Kabir healing and fleeing. Moving on, Kabir cloning Azad, betrayal, and kidnap of Priya, leading to court-martial and Freddy breaking off the engagement.\n\nThen, the masked men taking Priya hostage, the chase, and Kabir revealing himself. Azad’s actions, Pam suggesting electricity to kill clones, and the team infiltrating the subway. Failed password attempts, Priya waking up, suggesting using 'Eklavya', Misha reporting to Azad, Priya alerting them, Freddy and Rocky destroying the program and capturing Kabir.\n\nNext, the fight against clones, which keep rejuvenating because of an internal power source. Azad arriving, being shot, the ambush on the convoy with soldiers killed. Flashback about Kabir’s invention for cloning Freddy and Rocky’s DNA. The team leaving the base, Kabir waking up, being the masked man, leaving a message.\n\nKilling henchmen, returning, revealing Kabir’s plan to deactivate Karan Kavach and launch airstrikes. The nearly immortalmasked men being clones, Misha fighting Kabir, impaling him, Freddy and Rocky killing him. Misha and Rocky meeting Pam, then Misha meeting an agent in Shanghai, who gets killed. \n\nI think the order makes sense, but I should double-check the transitions. It's important to ensure that each sentence flows into the next logically without jumping around. Also, some sentences might be fragmented, so grouping related events together would help.\n\nI need to make sure that the main plot points are in the correct sequence: introducing the problem, the initial actions, the betrayal, the conflict, the chase, the reveal of Kabir, the fight, the resolution, and the final showdown. Making sure each paragraph covers a smooth progression of events will help the summary read cohesively.\n\nLastly, I'll ensure the plot summary starts with PLOT_SUMMARY, as instructed, and the sentences are correctly ordered without any disconnections.\n",

    "ground_truth":"At the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, the Indian national football team faces a major defeat against Yugoslavia with a score of 10-1. The members of the All India Football Federation blame the coach Syed Abdul Rahim for the team's underperformance. Rahim requests for permission to form another team with new players. The members of the federation are reluctant, especially Subhankar, but he receives support from President Anjan, who grants him permission. Rahim then scouts for players from all over India and forms a new team consisting of Tulsidas Balaram from Secunderabad, Peter Thangaraj from Hyderabad and P. K. Banerjee and Chuni Goswami from Calcutta among others. Roy Choudhary, an influential journalist from Calcutta holds a grudge against Rahim, as he has formed the team with very less number of players from Calcutta. At a party organized for the new team, Rahim and Roy Choudhary have a bitter exchange, where they humiliate each other. At the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, the Indian team prepares to play against Australia. A player from the Australian team disrespects Neville D'Souza and makes him tie his shoes. Neville goes on to score a hat-trick and the Indian team wins the match with a score of 7-1, leaving the Australian team in shock. The Indian team eventually secures the fourth position at the Olympics. Meanwhile, Roy Choudhary and Subhankar plan to remove Rahim from the federation and make Subhankar the President. At the 1960 Summer Olympics the Indian team is pitted against France, which is considered the best team in the world. The match draws with a score of 1-1 and the Indian team fails to qualify. The federation removes Rahim as coach for the Indian team on the grounds that the team has failed to give a good performance for a long period of time. Rahim also learns that he has developed lung cancer due to his excessive smoking and will not live long. Rahim decides to spend his remaining days at home with his family and has frequent coughing fits. His wife, Saira, motivates him, telling him to not give up and pursue his dream of leading the Indian team to win a gold medal. Rahim requests the federation to let him coach the team again and promises that if the team does not win a gold medal, he will not coach any team again in his life. Subhankar, who is now President, initially refuses but has to give in to his request as the other members of the federation give their votes to let Rahim coach the team, given the even poor performance of the team since the time Rahim was removed as coach. Rahim begins to coach the team again and prepares them for the 1962 Asian Games in Jakarta. However, the Finance Ministry refuses to let the Indian team participate in the competition, given insufficient funds. Rahim personally speaks with the Finance Minister Morarji Desai and requests to let the team participate, explaining its significance. The Minister agrees, given the condition that only a selected few players will be allowed to go for the competition. Rahim agrees to it and decides to take only 16 best players from the team and leave out the rest, including his son Hakim, who had also begun to play for the team. Thangaraj, the team's goalkeeper is injured before their first match and is replaced by Pradyut Barman, which weakens the team. In their first match, the Indian team is pitted against South Korea and they face defeat, with the teammates blaming one another for their poor performance. After the match, Rahim makes them understand the importance of formation and coordination. In their next match against Thailand, Jarnail Singh, a player from the Indian team is gravely injured by an opponent. Rahim instructs the Indian team ‘to make them pay for it’ and they go on to play more aggressively, winning the match with a score of 4-1. An Indian diplomat publicly criticises the decision of not allowing Israel and Taiwan to play in the competition, which angers the people of Indonesia, leading to massive public protests against the Indian team. On the day of the final match, where the Indian team would play against South Korea, the team bus is attacked by protesters and the military is brought in to provide security for them. Rahim's health deteriorates and he begins coughing up blood, but still motivates the team by delivering an inspiring speech. On seeing Rahim's determination, Roy Choudhary has a change of heart and starts supporting the Indian team. Thangaraj and Singh also rejoin the team for the match. The Indian team goes on to win the match with a score of 2-1, winning the gold medal at the Asian Games.",

    "reasoning":"\nOkay, so I have this plot summary from a movie that's been jumbled up. My task is to reorder these sentences correctly so that the plot makes sense. Let me try to figure out the sequence by identifying key events and determining their chronological order.\n\nFirst, I notice that the main character is Rahim, a coach for the Indian football team. There are several key moments in his career: being removed as coach, his health issues, coaching again, and a significant tournament where the team performs well or not.\n\nI'll start by listing out the sentences and try to see which one logically follows another. \n\nThe story begins with Rahim deciding to spend his remaining days at home, which suggests that this is a point after his health has deteriorated. Then, it mentions his frequent coughing fits, so maybe his health issues come after his removal from coaching or around that time.\n\nThe Indian team securing the fourth position at the Olympics would likely happen after a significant match or event. There's a mention of the team winning a match against Australia with a score of 2-1, which could be a key victory. But then, the team fails later because they drew 1-1, so that event comes after the victory.\n\nAnother important event is the removal of Rahim as coach because of poor performance. So, that must happen before his decline in health or maybe after. It seems like the removal leads to his health problems, so I think his health issues come after being removed.\n\nThere are multiple instances where Rahim is coaching at different Olympics: 1952, 1956, 1960. Each seems to have its own set of events. For example, in 1952, the team lost badly to Yugoslavia, 10-1. Then, in 1956, they prepared but failed against Australia. Later, in 1960, they faced France, the best team in the world, and did well.\n\nThere's also a sub-plot involving Subhankar trying to take over as president to remove Rahim. He plans with Roy Choudhary but ultimately gives in because of poor performance.\n\nAnother angle is the formation of a new team with young players, which happens after his removal as coach. He scouted players like Tulsidas and Peter, but then there was an injury to Thangaraj, who was replaced by Pradyut, affecting their performance.\n\n There's a protest against Israel and Taiwan not playing, which caused protests in Indonesia. That seems to be a separate event leading to public reactions.\n\nRahim's declining health due to lung cancer is mentioned, so that likely occurs towards the end as he's coaching the team again.\n\nAt the end, there’s a crucial match where they defeat South Korea 7-1, but this seems to be part of the 1960 or 1962 events. Then, there's a victory against Thailand with a 4-1 scoreline.\n\nPutting this all together, the timeline would be something like:\n\n- Starting at a point after his removal as coach, his health starts failing.\n- He then requests to coach again, forms a new team, but faces funding issues.\n- Despite this, he encourages the team, deals with protests, and leads them to victories, though with some setbacks like player injuries.\n\nI'll need to arrange the sentences so that each event flows logically into the next, showing his struggle, health decline, and eventual redemption or final victory.\n\nI think the correct order would start with his health decline after being removed as coach, then his attempt to form a new team, the protests, the competition issues, his health diagnosis, and finally, the team's success in crucial matches.\n\nLet me go through each sentence and see where each fits:\n\n1. \"Rahim decides to spend his remaining days at home with his family and has frequent coughing fits.\" – This seems to be an early point after his removal.\n\n2. \"The Indian team eventually secures the fourth position at the Olympics.\" – After a match win, they get fourth.\n\n3. \"Meanwhile, Roy Choudhary and Subhankar plan to remove Rahim from the federation and make Subhankar the President.\" – This is likely during the time after his removal.\n\n4. \"The Indian team goes on to win the match with a score of 2-1, winning the gold medal at the Asian Games.\" – This victory might come after the triumph at the Asian Games, leading to Olympic success.\n\n5. \"The federation removes Rahim as coach...\" – This happens after poor performance.\n\n6. \"At the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne...\" – So after he's removed, but then he's persuaded to coach again, leading to that Olympics.\n\n7. \"Rahim agrees to it and decides to take only 16 best players...\" – He leaves out his son, causing conflict.\n\n8. \"At a party organized for the new team, Rahim and Roy Choudhary have a bitter exchange...\" – This occurs after forming the new team.\n\n9. \"The match draws with a score of 1-1 and the Indian team fails to qualify.\" – Result of the conflict and strategy.\n\n10. \"Rahim requests the federation to let him coach the team again...\" – After the failure, he tries to come back.\n\n11. \"At the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, the Indian national football team faces a major defeat...\" – This is a past event leading to his health issues.\n\n12. \"K. Rahim's health deteriorates...\" – So this follows after the 1956 Olympics, as he was coaching then.\n\n13. \"Rahim begins to coach the team again...\" – After his removal, he's invited back.\n\n14. \"A player from the Australian team disrespects Neville D'Souza...\" – This is likely before the crucial match.\n\n15.\"The Minister agrees, given the condition that only a selected few players...\" – This leads to the formation of a new team despite protests.\n\n16.\"Rahim personally speaks with the Finance Minister Morarji Desai...\" – This is this after the selection issue.\n\n17.\"An Indian diplomat publicly criticises...\" – Resulting in protests, so after the minister agrees.\n\n18.\"Subhankar, who is now President, initially refuses...\" – Because he's part of the conspiracy to remove Rahim earlier.\n\n19.\"Rahim requests for permission to form another team with new players.\" – After the 1956 failure, he scouts new players.\n\n20.\"However, the Finance Ministry refuses to let the Indian team participate...\" – Because of insufficient funds.\n\n21.\"In their first match, the Indian team is pitted against South Korea...\" – Despite the funding issues, they play, but lose, with teammates blaming each other.\n\n22.\"Rahim also learns that he has developed lung cancer...\" – So towards the end, after the first match defeat.\n\n23.\"Thangaraj, the team's goalkeeper is injured...\" – Before the next match, leading to replacement.\n\n24.\"The members of the All India Football Federation blame the coach...\" – After the match loss, likely before the final.\n\n25.\"On the day of the final match, where the Indian team would play...\" – This is the climax, where despite protests, they win.\n\n26.\"Neville goes on to score a hat-trick...\" – Key victory.\n\n27.\"Roy Choudhary, an influential journalist...\" – His girlfriend Saira supports him, improving his stance.\n\n28.\"The members of the federation are reluctant...\" – But eventually granted permission.\n\n29.\"At the 1960 Summer Olympics the Indian team is pitted against France...\" – The big challenge.\n\n30.\"On seeing Rahim's determination, Roy Choudhary...\" – His support comes after his health decline.\n\n31.\"Thangaraj and Singh also rejoin the team...\" – strengthening the team.\n\n32.\"In their next match against Thailand...\" – Post their success against South Korea.\n\n33.\"Jarnail Singh, a player from the Indian team is gravely injured by an opponent.\" – Leading to aggressive play, which they win.\n\nPutting it all together, the correct order should start with Rahim deciding to coach again, facing opposition, dealing with health issues, forming a new team, overcoming obstacles like protests and funding issues, leading up to the big matches where the team ultimately succeeds, with key players like Neville scoring, despite challenges like injuries and opposition from federation members.\n",
