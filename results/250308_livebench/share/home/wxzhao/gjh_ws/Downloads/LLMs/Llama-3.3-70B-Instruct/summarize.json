The only human visitors to the 70-acre site in Vaimaanga pay a small fee to explore what has become known as the biggest white elephant in the South Pacific.

    "response":"<<Abandoned Luxury Resort>>\nThe Sheraton hotel complex on the South Pacific island of Rarotonga has been abandoned for a quarter of a century.

However, the project collapsed amid allegations of mafia involvement and money laundering, leaving the Cook Islands government with a debt of $120m. Despite repeated attempts to finish the project, none have been successful, and the site has remained abandoned. The failed project has become known as the biggest white elephant in the South Pacific.\n\n*** \nA new effort to salvage the buildings is currently underway, led by Tim Tepaki, a Cook Islander with experience in property development in New Zealand.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Pauline Hanson has likened the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, to a “spoilt brat” for ruling out a deal with One Nation. Arriving in Bundaberg just as the Labor campaign left, Hanson, who remains the most visible One Nation asset in Queensland, despite not running in Saturday’s state election, lashed out at Palaszczuk’s continued criticism of the party. Palaszczuk’s insistence that Labor would rather go into opposition than form government with One Nation has become its strongest attack line against the Liberal National party, which is directly preferencing One Nation in 50 of the 61 seats it is running in, as well as admitting, indirectly, it would form government with One Nation, if necessary. The opposition leader, Tim Nicholls, who has previously said he would work with the parliament Queenslanders delivered, was unable to answer “yes or no” to the question of whether he would form government with One Nation on Tuesday during a radio quiz, instead opting for “pass”. Hanson has responded with the line that the major parties are choosing not to respect the will of the people, in the same way Donald Trump’s campaign used Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment against the Democrat campaign last year. “I don’t think the premier knows what she is doing actually, I think she is in such a turmoil over this and she is actually needs to get out of the sandpit and be the leader for this state,” Hanson said. “Because the way she is carrying on, it is not leadership, it is not quality. “To say you won’t work with One Nation, it is just ridiculous. It’s like a spoilt brat, she is carrying on like a spoilt kid, and if that is what leadership means then I think she is heading down the wrong path and Tim Nicholls, he needs to grow up and make a decision, because people want clear decision in this state.

    "response":"Section 1\nThe article discusses the current political situation in Queensland, Australia, where Pauline Hanson, the leader of One Nation, has criticized the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, for ruling out a deal with her party.\n\nSection 2\nThe criticism comes as Palaszczuk's Labor party has been attacking the Liberal National party for considering a potential alliance with One Nation, despite the latter's controversial reputation. This has led to a heated exchange between Hanson and Palaszczuk, with Hanson accusing the premier of being a \"spoilt brat\" for refusing to work with One Nation.\n\nSection 3\nHere are the key points from the article:\n* Pauline Hanson has likened Annastacia Palaszczuk to a \"spoilt brat\" for refusing to consider a deal with One Nation.\n* Palaszczuk's Labor party has ruled out forming government with One Nation, while the Liberal National party has left the door open to a potential alliance.\n* The opposition leader, Tim Nicholls, has been criticized for failing to provide a clear answer on whether he would form government with One Nation.\n* Hanson has accused the major parties of disrespecting the will of the people by refusing to work with One Nation, drawing comparisons with Donald Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nSection 4\nThe article suggests that the debate over One Nation's potential role in a future Queensland government has become a key issue in the state election, with both major parties attempting to use it to their advantage. Hanson's criticism of Palaszczuk and Nicholls reflects the intensity of the campaign and the high stakes involved.\n\nSection 5\nOverall, the article provides insight into the complex and often contentious world of Queensland politics, where parties are navigating complex alliances and rivalries in the lead-up to the state election. The exchange between Hanson and Palaszczuk highlights the deep divisions between the major parties and the challenges they face in forming a stable and effective government.",

In a company memo, obtained by the Hollywood Reporter, Lasseter writes that he has fallen short in creating a culture that engenders “support and collaboration” and hints at behavior that he has been confronted about. “I’ve recently had a number of difficult conversations that have been very painful for me,” he writes. “It’s never easy to face your missteps, but it’s the only way to learn from them. As a result, I’ve been giving a lot of thought to the leader I am today compared to the mentor, advocate and champion I want to be. It’s been brought to my attention that I have made some of you feel disrespected or uncomfortable. That was never my intent.” Lasseter, who is one of the founders of Pixar and the director of Toy Story, also apologizes for letting employees down while adding more details about the conduct that has led to him taking a sabbatical. “I especially want to apologize to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form,” he writes. “No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.” In a statement, a Disney spokesperson responded: “We are committed to maintaining an environment in which all employees are respected and empowered to do their best work. We appreciate John’s candor and sincere apology and fully support his sabbatical.” The memo has arrived at the same time as an investigation by the Hollywood Reporter into complaints about Lasseter’s behavior.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

It’s been brought to my attention that I have made some of you feel disrespected or uncomfortable. That was never my intent.” Lasseter, who is one of the founders of Pixar and the director of Toy Story, also apologizes for letting employees down while adding more details about the conduct that has led to him taking a sabbatical. “I especially want to apologize to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form,” he writes. “No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.” In a statement, a Disney spokesperson responded: “We are committed to maintaining an environment in which all employees are respected and empowered to do their best work.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Australia’s race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, says the high no vote in western Sydney in last week’s historic same-sex marriage postal survey reflects religious observance rather than ethnicity, and he has warned against an outbreak of crass, cultural stereotyping. Soutphommasane used a speech at the University of Western Sydney to issue a pointed warning against adopting “easy narratives” devoid of evidence about the behaviour or inclinations of particular ethnic groups in Australia. “In a world that many describe as post-truth or post-factual, our social cohesion is not always well served by jumping to conclusions,” he said. “Once-appealing narratives take hold, they can help fuel stereotypes about others – and these can be difficult to shake off. Sometimes this is because they may conveniently help to confirm cultural hierarchies in our society.” Soutphommasane said a narrative has sprung up since the postal survey which centres on ethnic minorities or multicultural communities being intrinsically hostile towards same-sex marriage, and to the LGBTI community at large. He said while some ethnic communities hold to the view that marriage is between a man and a woman, that view is shaped often by religious or cultural traditions. The race commissioner said a more clear-eyed examination of the postal survey data suggests religiosity, or religious observance, was a more significant factor for no voters – a fact well understood by the no campaign, which targeted messages to a range of communities in Sydney’s west. Soutphommasane said if you look at the voting trends outside western Sydney, a more mixed picture emerges – a picture where seats with populations of more than 40% born overseas overwhelmingly voted yes. He pointed out that the most multicultural electorates in New South Wales and Victoria recorded high yes votes – seats like Sydney, Grayndler, Kingsford Smith, Bradfield, Batman, Wills, Gellibrand and Chisholm. “To suggest that an overwhelming majority of multicultural communities voted no – and did so out of some essential cultural hostility against gays and lesbians – is to entertain something that comes close to an unkind stereotype,” the race commissioner said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Confirmation of Robert Mugabe’s ouster prompted revelry on the streets of Harare. “The Goblin has gone!” raved one. Thousands of miles away in Beijing – for years Mugabe’s most powerful backer – there were no obvious signs of jubilation. “China respects Mr Mugabe’s decision to resign,” foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters, praising his “historic contribution” to Zimbabwe’s liberation. “He remains a good friend of the Chinese people.” But experts believe China’s leaders will be both relieved and contented to see the back of “Comrade Bob” – a suspicion reinforced by the approving tone coverage of his demise has taken in the Communist party-controlled press. “We need change in our country,” China’s official news agency Xinhua – whose correspondents’ dispatches are expected, above all else, to reflect the party line – quoted one Zimbabwean teacher as saying of Mugabe’s resignation. “We’re very happy,” another Zimbabwean told party mouthpiece the People’s Daily. “Finally things will change.” Ross Anthony, an expert in China-Africa relations from South Africa’s Stellenbosch University, said that while Beijing had backed Mugabe since his days as a Marxist revolutionary in the 1970s, it had increasingly seen him as erratic, an embarrassment and a threat to Chinese investments. A case in point was Mugabe’s controversial indigenisation law, which required all foreign companies to be controlled by Zimbabweans and was a particular blow to Chinese interests in its diamond industry. “I imagine there are quite a lot of officials in Beijing who will be happy to see Mugabe go,” Anthony said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Patients are being put at risk because doctors are giving them drugs they do not need and sending them for unnecessary surgery to avoid a complaint being made against them, research has revealed. Medics are so scared of being complained about that they are also giving patients more tests than their symptoms merit and not performing procedures that involve more risk than usual. Four out of five doctors who become the subject of a complaint find the experience so stressful that they start practising more “defensive medicine” than before, according to a survey of 6,144 doctors in Britain about whom a patient, relative or colleague had complained. “This involved ‘hedging’, which includes performing more tests than necessary, over-referral and overprescribing as well as ‘avoidance’, which includes avoiding procedures, not accepting high-risk patients or abandoning procedures early,” according to research by a team led by Prof Tom Bourne of Imperial College London, whose findings have been published in the journal BMJ Open. “These behaviours may have a serious impact on patient care,” they warned. While litigation, complaints and investigations are intended to protect patients from poor care and medical negligence, the “burden and stress associated with these processes are clearly having unintended consequences and it may be argued that when examined as a whole, these structures may be causing more harm to patient care than good,” the study said. “While the regulatory system may protect patients from the misconduct of a relatively small number of doctors, it has a perverse effect on the majority of doctors who become preoccupied by defensive practice,” it added. Doctors who resort to “fear-driven working practices that could compromise patient care” also waste vital resources and their conduct “creates significant costs for the NHS”, the co-authors added. Bourne could not quantify how much NHS spending goes on that, but pointed to a study that found such practices accounted for 10% of Italy’s health budget.

At a press conference in Adelaide on Wednesday, Kakoschke-Moore announced she had received advice from the UK Home Office on Friday, confirmed by a specialist barrister, that she had received British citizenship from her mother, who was born in Singapore in 1957. Kakoschke-Moore had always believed she was not British because her father had received advice from the British embassy in Oman she was not eligible for citizenship when she was 12. She said she was “heartbroken” to discover she was British, which she described as “extremely surprising” because she “had no reason to believe I was a British citizen until that point”. Kakoschke-Moore explained that her mother was born in Singapore, a former British colony, which gave her “citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies” and became a British citizen in 1983 when the British Nationality Act came into effect. Kakoschke-Moore, born in Darwin in 1985, then gained that citizenship by descent. Kakoschke-Moore said she would request the matter be referred to the high court to determine how the vacancy would be filled, adding she would “continue to run” for the NXT and “at this stage” her ambition was to come back to the Senate. A recount of the 2016 Senate election would likely elect the NXT candidate Tim Storrer, who unsuccessfully attempted to replace Xenophon in the Senate by challenging the party’s chosen successor. Xenophon said he and his colleagues were “devastated” by the loss of Kakoschke-Moore from the Senate, but predicted it was “not the end of her political career”. Xenophon said the party had preliminary legal advice the position may not be filled by a recount, claiming the situation was “uncharted legal territory” because of the high court’s recent decision involving Hollie Hughes.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Speaking at his Papitalai parish church on Los Negros Island, across a small bay from the detention centre, Taulam said the enforced shutdown of the centre – in which 380 men remain – had left people vulnerable and suffering. Over years of pastoral care, he has built up friendships with many of those in the centre, he told the Guardian and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. “Now when they say they have no food, no water, no lights, they are deprived physically but they are saying too, that the physical is also spiritual for them. They are deprived of faith. They are suffering.” Taulam said no government seemed willing to take care of the men who remain in the centre. “Australia seems to be saying, ‘Papua New Guinea, this is your responsibility’.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Late last year, the Electoral Commission started an investigation into a striking set of circumstances. In February 2016 Steve Baker MP, lobbying for Vote Leave to be designated the “official” leave campaign, sent a round robin email asking recipients to support it, because it claimed to have found a loophole in the spending rules. “It is open to the Vote Leave family to create separate legal entities each of which could spend £700k: Vote Leave will be able to spend as much money as is necessary to win the referendum,” he wrote. But Baker – now a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) – got it wrong. The law that protects our democracy from capture appears to make this behaviour illegal: when a sockpuppet signs your cheques, the spending still counts as yours. The Electoral Commission knew about Baker’s email – it was reported in the Times. But despite knowing that Vote Leave appeared to have contemplated acting unlawfully, the Electoral Commission went ahead and designated it as the official leave campaign. Then we come to the referendum campaign. With under a month to go, Vote Leave was bumping up against the limits of what it could lawfully spend. But it had plenty of money left over from wealthy donors.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.  Wrap your entire response with double quotation marks.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Late last year, the Electoral Commission started an investigation into a striking set of circumstances. In February 2016 Steve Baker MP, lobbying for Vote Leave to be designated the “official” leave campaign, sent a round robin email asking recipients to support it, because it claimed to have found a loophole in the spending rules. “It is open to the Vote Leave family to create separate legal entities each of which could spend £700k: Vote Leave will be able to spend as much money as is necessary to win the referendum,” he wrote. But Baker – now a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) – got it wrong. The law that protects our democracy from capture appears to make this behaviour illegal: when a sockpuppet signs your cheques, the spending still counts as yours. The Electoral Commission knew about Baker’s email – it was reported in the Times. But despite knowing that Vote Leave appeared to have contemplated acting unlawfully, the Electoral Commission went ahead and designated it as the official leave campaign. Then we come to the referendum campaign. With under a month to go, Vote Leave was bumping up against the limits of what it could lawfully spend. But it had plenty of money left over from wealthy donors.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.  Wrap your entire response with double quotation marks.

Ruddock’s appointment by cabinet, announced on Wednesday, is designed to head off a bruising debate about religious amendments in a same-sex marriage bill, but the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the review was “no substitute” for those amendments. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said it was important to look at the issue of religious freedom carefully, in light of the yes vote and impending legislation on marriage equality.

Turnbull said a variety of proposals for legislative changes to protect freedom of religion have been put forward in recent months but many of them go beyond the immediate issue of marriage, and parliament needed to be wary of them. “Any reforms to protect religious freedom at large should be undertaken carefully,” he said in a statement on Wednesday. “There is a high risk of unintended consequences when parliament attempts to legislate protections for basic rights and freedoms, such as freedom of religion.

    "response":"The Australian government has appointed former Liberal minister Philip Ruddock to examine whether the country's laws adequately protect the human right to religious freedom. This move is seen as an attempt to address concerns about religious amendments in a same-sex marriage bill, which is expected to be introduced following the recent \"yes\" vote on marriage equality.\n\n*** \nRuddock's appointment was announced by the cabinet on Wednesday, and he has been tasked with reporting his findings by March 31.

Turnbull noted that various proposals for legislative changes to protect freedom of religion have been put forward, but many of them go beyond the immediate issue of marriage.\n\n*** \nThe treasurer, Scott Morrison, cautioned that the review led by Ruddock is \"no substitute\" for the religious amendments that some conservatives are pushing for. However, other senior conservatives, such as Peter Dutton and Mathias Cormann, have suggested that a religious freedom bill can be considered separately from the marriage bill, potentially next year. This indicates that there may be differing opinions within the government on how to approach the issue of religious freedom.\n\n*** \nTurnbull expressed concerns about the potential risks of legislating protections for basic rights and freedoms, such as freedom of religion. He warned that \"generally worded bill of rights-style declarations\" can create uncertainties and have unintended consequences. The government is keen to avoid such outcomes and is seeking a careful and considered approach to any potential legislative reforms.\n\n*** \nRuddock's experience as Australia's special envoy for human rights makes him a suitable choice to lead the review, according to Turnbull.

    "filtered_answer":"The Australian government has appointed former Liberal minister Philip Ruddock to examine whether the country's laws adequately protect the human right to religious freedom. This move is seen as an attempt to address concerns about religious amendments in a same-sex marriage bill, which is expected to be introduced following the recent \"yes\" vote on marriage equality.\n\n*** \nRuddock's appointment was announced by the cabinet on Wednesday, and he has been tasked with reporting his findings by March 31. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, emphasized the importance of carefully considering the issue of religious freedom in light of the impending legislation on marriage equality. Turnbull noted that various proposals for legislative changes to protect freedom of religion have been put forward, but many of them go beyond the immediate issue of marriage.\n\n*** \nThe treasurer, Scott Morrison, cautioned that the review led by Ruddock is \"no substitute\" for the religious amendments that some conservatives are pushing for. However, other senior conservatives, such as Peter Dutton and Mathias Cormann, have suggested that a religious freedom bill can be considered separately from the marriage bill, potentially next year. This indicates that there may be differing opinions within the government on how to approach the issue of religious freedom.\n\n*** \nTurnbull expressed concerns about the potential risks of legislating protections for basic rights and freedoms, such as freedom of religion. He warned that \"generally worded bill of rights-style declarations\" can create uncertainties and have unintended consequences. The government is keen to avoid such outcomes and is seeking a careful and considered approach to any potential legislative reforms.\n\n*** \nRuddock's experience as Australia's special envoy for human rights makes him a suitable choice to lead the review, according to Turnbull. The prime minister described the review as a \"timely expert stocktake\" that will inform the government's consideration of any necessary legislative reforms. The review is expected to provide a thorough examination of the issue and help the government to make informed decisions about how to protect religious freedom in Australia.",

The club will need to offer him a competitive wage and a suitable contract to persuade him to sign an extension. If they fail to do so, they risk losing him to a Spanish club, such as Real Madrid, who have been monitoring his situation. The fact that Courtois's former girlfriend has returned to Spain with their children may also influence his decision, as he may want to be closer to them. Chelsea will be anxious to resolve the situation as soon as possible, to avoid any uncertainty and to ensure that they can plan for the future. The club's fans will be hoping that Courtois will sign a new contract and remain at Stamford Bridge, given his contributions to the team's success in recent years. The goalkeeper's performances have been instrumental in Chelsea's Premier League titles, and his absence would be felt if he were to leave. Courtois has stated that he is happy at Chelsea, but the club will need to meet his wage demands and offer him a suitable contract to keep him at the club. The situation is ongoing, and it remains to be seen how it will develop in the coming months. Chelsea will be keen to avoid a situation where Courtois enters the final year of his contract, as this would give him significant leverage in any negotiations. The club will want to avoid losing him for a lower fee, and will be working to achieve a positive resolution to the situation. Courtois's agent will play a key role in the negotiations, and will be working to secure the best possible deal for his client.\n\n\n\\n\\n\n\nIn conclusion, the contract situation of Thibaut Courtois is complex and has many factors to consider. Chelsea will be working to resolve the situation as soon as possible, to avoid any uncertainty and to ensure that they can plan for the future. The club will need to offer Courtois a competitive wage and a suitable contract to persuade him to sign an extension. If they fail to do so, they risk losing him to a Spanish club, such as Real Madrid, who have been monitoring his situation.

The outcome of the situation is uncertain, but one thing is clear: Chelsea will be doing everything in their power to keep Courtois at the club. Is there anything else I can help with?",

    "response":"The provided text appears to be a satirical piece, criticizing certain cooking shows and their hosts. The author uses a creative and humorous tone to express their disdain for these programs. The text does not mention an annual event, but it does imply that these shows are a regular occurrence, possibly even a weekly or daily figure in the television landscape.\n\nThe use of words like \"banter\" and \"vinaigrette\" suggests that the author is poking fun at the overly casual and try-hard nature of these cooking shows. The image of Tim Lovejoy in distressed chambray, saying \"yeah\" repeatedly, is a particularly scathing critique of the show's lack of depth and substance. It's as if the author is saying that these shows are so vapid, they suck the creativity out of cooking.\n\nThe second part of the text, titled \"The Costume Romp,\" appears to be a critique of period dramas or costume dramas that prioritize spectacle over substance. The author uses phrases like \"priapic jackanapes\" and \"peephole codpieces\" to create a vivid and absurd image, implying that these shows are more concerned with titillation than with telling a genuine story.\n\nThe use of the phrase \"Grade II-listed mummers\" suggests that the author is criticizing the way these shows often prioritize historical accuracy over creative storytelling. It's as if the author is saying that these shows are so bound by tradition and expectation that they fail to deliver a truly creative or engaging experience.\n\nIn terms of a cousin to these cooking shows, one might think of other lifestyle or reality TV programs that prioritize entertainment over education or substance. These shows often feature a charismatic host or figure who guides the viewer through a series of challenges or recipes, but ultimately, they suck the joy out of the experience by making it feel formulaic and predictable.\n\nThe author's tone is decidedly negative, implying that these shows are a waste of time and a poor representation of what cooking or drama should be. The use of words like \"hauntingly narrow kitchen\" and \"mirthless laughter\" creates a sense of unease and discomfort, suggesting that the author finds these shows to be more annoying than entertaining.\n\nOverall, the text is a creative and humorous critique of certain types of TV shows. The author uses vivid language and absurd imagery to make their point, implying that these shows are more concerned with spectacle than substance. While the text does not mention an annual event or a cousin in the classical sense, it does imply that these shows are part of a larger cultural landscape that prioritizes entertainment over education or creativity.\n\nIn terms of figures, the author mentions Tim Lovejoy and James Martin, both of whom are TV personalities known for their cooking shows. The text also mentions \"other uneasy men in distressed chambray,\" implying that these shows often feature a certain type of host or personality.\n\nThe use of the phrase \"what is that all about then?\" suggests that the author is genuinely perplexed by the popularity of these shows.

    "response":"The article begins with the author, an ambulance worker, discussing a recent incident where their ambulance made headlines due to a note left on the windscreen. The note, which was tweeted by a colleague and went viral, complained about the ambulance being parked in a way that blocked the writer's drive. The ambulance crew had arrived at the scene with a patient in critical condition, who was vomiting blood. The crew's primary concern was the patient's well-being, and they didn't have time to worry about parking in a specific spot. The road was double-parked, which made it difficult to find a suitable parking space. The crew's approach to parking is usually measured, but in emergency situations like this, they prioritize assessing the situation over finding a perfect parking spot. The author can't recall if their crewmate had blocked the drive, as their focus was on the patient. The patient's condition was severe, and the crew needed to act quickly to provide medical attention. The crew's first job of the day had been to respond to this emergency, and they had arrived to find people waiting outside to meet them. One man, in particular, looked very concerned, which suggested that the situation was serious. The crew's training and experience kicked in as they quickly assessed the situation and sprang into action. They decided to use a stretcher to transport the patient, which is a common procedure in emergency situations. The authors' colleague tweeted a picture of the note, which was likely done to highlight the challenges that ambulance crews face in emergency situations. The tweet went viral, suggesting that it resonated with many people.

    "filtered_answer":"The article begins with the author, an ambulance worker, discussing a recent incident where their ambulance made headlines due to a note left on the windscreen. The note, which was tweeted by a colleague and went viral, complained about the ambulance being parked in a way that blocked the writer's drive. The ambulance crew had arrived at the scene with a patient in critical condition, who was vomiting blood. The crew's primary concern was the patient's well-being, and they didn't have time to worry about parking in a specific spot. The road was double-parked, which made it difficult to find a suitable parking space. The crew's approach to parking is usually measured, but in emergency situations like this, they prioritize assessing the situation over finding a perfect parking spot. The author can't recall if their crewmate had blocked the drive, as their focus was on the patient. The patient's condition was severe, and the crew needed to act quickly to provide medical attention. The crew's first job of the day had been to respond to this emergency, and they had arrived to find people waiting outside to meet them. One man, in particular, looked very concerned, which suggested that the situation was serious. The crew's training and experience kicked in as they quickly assessed the situation and sprang into action. They decided to use a stretcher to transport the patient, which is a common procedure in emergency situations. The authors' colleague tweeted a picture of the note, which was likely done to highlight the challenges that ambulance crews face in emergency situations. The tweet went viral, suggesting that it resonated with many people.

    "response":"<<Care Home Costs and Financial Obligations>>\nThe article from the Guardian discusses the soaring costs of care homes, with self-funders paying around £34,000 a year. However, the reader argues that the article fails to provide an accurate account of the financial obligations of self-funders. The media often misrepresents the situation, stating that local authorities \"pick up the tab\" when a person's assets fall to £23,250. In reality, local authorities continue to take a portion of the person's assets on a sliding scale until they reach £14,250.\n\n*** \nThe reader explains that even when a care home resident's assets fall to £14,250, their contributions do not end. The council will still claw back any pensions, state or private, and expect families to pay top-up fees. This means that self-funders continue to incur significant costs even after their assets have been largely depleted. The reader shares their personal experience, where their mother has paid over £250,000 for nursing home care over four years, having been forced to sell her flat and use her savings.\n\n*** \nOne of the major problems highlighted by the reader is the privatization of care homes. With no limit on what they can charge self-funders, care homes can demand high fees, leading to a rapid depletion of a person's resources. This ultimately means that local authorities have to step in, taking on the financial burden. The reader notes that this situation is exacerbated by investors being encouraged to put their money into UK care homes, promised an 8% return on their stake. This creates a lucrative market for care home owners, but one that comes at the expense of vulnerable individuals and their families.\n\n*** \nThe reader's letter highlights the need for a more accurate and nuanced understanding of the financial obligations of self-funders in care homes. It also underscores the importance of addressing the issues surrounding the privatization of care homes and the lack of limits on what they can charge. By shining a light on these problems, the reader hopes to raise awareness and spark a conversation about the need for reform in the care home sector. Ultimately, the goal should be to ensure that care home residents and their families are treated fairly and do not face financial ruin due to soaring care costs.",

Why? Why?” I look at my favourite boxer, who used to be rated as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world, and prepare to tell him the obvious reason. But, pausing first, I remember the compelling stir Toney created in the early 1990s. Before then, when he was still carrying a gun and selling crack on the outskirts of Detroit, Toney’s life seemed distorted by his violent past. His father had repeatedly beaten his mother, Sherry, at gunpoint. When James was only one, his dad shot Sherry and left them for dead. But Sherry is an incredible woman and, even though James was troubled, she channelled his incoherent rage.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n “Why?” James Toney says fiercely as, just a foot away, the once brilliant and intimidating boxer leans forward and stares at me. “You wanted me to stop fighting? Why? Why?” I look at my favourite boxer, who used to be rated as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world, and prepare to tell him the obvious reason. But, pausing first, I remember the compelling stir Toney created in the early 1990s. Before then, when he was still carrying a gun and selling crack on the outskirts of Detroit, Toney’s life seemed distorted by his violent past. His father had repeatedly beaten his mother, Sherry, at gunpoint. When James was only one, his dad shot Sherry and left them for dead. But Sherry is an incredible woman and, even though James was troubled, she channelled his incoherent rage. She brought him to a boxing gym so that, if he wanted to fight everyone, at least he could learn how to do it properly.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"<<The Turbulent Life of James Toney>>\n\nThe article begins with a provocative question from James Toney, a former brilliant and intimidating boxer, who is now facing a difficult chapter in his life. As the interviewer prepares to respond, they are reminded of Toney's tumultuous past, which was marked by violence and disaster. Growing up on the outskirts of Detroit, Toney was exposed to a life of crime, selling crack and carrying a gun, which ultimately led him to the floor of a boxing gym. It was there that his mother, Sherry, channelled his incoherent rage into a more productive outlet, teaching him how to fight properly. This decision would have a profound result on Toney's life, transforming him into one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world.\n\nHowever, despite his success in the ring, Toney's life was not without its challenges. His father's violent behavior had left an indelible mark, and Toney's own life was often plagued by self-destructive tendencies. His mother's efforts to guide him towards a more positive path were often threatened by the trash and negativity that surrounded him. Nevertheless, Sherry's determination and love for her son helped him to rise above the difficulties, at least for a time. As the article progresses, it is likely that we will see a more nuanced exploration of Toney's life, including the factors that contributed to his downfall and the result of his decisions. The conversation between Toney and the interviewer is poised to delve into the complexities of his story, revealing a more complete picture of this troubled boxing legend.",

The Metropolitan police have confirmed that they are looking into the new claims against the Hollywood actor, in addition to an existing investigation into similar allegations that was opened earlier this month. The latest allegations involve a man, referred to as Victim 2, who claims to have been sexually assaulted by Spacey in 2005. These claims were passed on to the Metropolitan police by the City of London police last Friday, and Scotland Yard has since begun an investigation. The earlier allegations, which were also referred by the City of London police, relate to an incident in 2008 involving a man identified as Victim 1. Both incidents are alleged to have taken place in the Lambeth area of south London. The police have refused to name the suspect in either case, but it is understood that the allegations are against the same individual, who is believed to be Kevin Spacey. The Metropolitan police have confirmed that officers from the child abuse and sexual offences command are investigating the allegations. Spacey has faced numerous accusations of sexual misconduct in both the US and the UK, with the Old Vic theatre, where he was artistic director from 2003 to 2015, receiving 56 contacts related to 20 individual allegations of inappropriate conduct. Some of these allegations are said to have been perpetrated against former staff members of the theatre. The investigations into Kevin Spacey's conduct are ongoing, and it is likely that more information will come to light in the coming weeks and months. The fact that the police are investigating two separate allegations against Spacey suggests that they are taking the claims seriously and are committed to thoroughly examining the evidence. The allegations against Spacey are part of a wider conversation about sexual misconduct in the entertainment industry, with many high-profile figures facing accusations and consequences for their actions. The investigation into Spacey's conduct is a significant development in this conversation, and it will be important to follow the progress of the case to see how it unfolds. The Metropolitan police have a responsibility to investigate these allegations thoroughly and to ensure that justice is served, and it is likely that they will be working closely with other agencies and organizations to gather evidence and build a case. Overall, the investigation into Kevin Spacey's conduct is a complex and serious matter that requires careful attention and consideration, and it is important that all parties involved are held accountable for their actions.\"",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n At this stage in her career, no one expects Björk’s latest record to sound much like her last one. And yet it’s hard to avoid heaving a thankful sigh when Arisen My Senses, the opening track of her ninth studio album, Utopia, crashes into life: birdsong giving way to bright splashes of electronics, beatific-sounding harp chords and cascading beats not unlike the oft-sampled rhythm track of Schoolly D’s old rap classic PSK, What Does It Mean? It sounds positively ecstatic, which comes as a relief. Utopia’s predecessor, 2015’s Vulnicura, was a remarkable record, a latterday entry into the canon of legendary break-up albums. It attained its place alongside Marvin Gaye’s Here, My Dear and Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks by setting its fathomless misery to atonal string arrangements and abstract electronics that, during its central track, kept vanishing into a single flatlining beep. It was raw, brave, challenging, unique and all the other adjectives heaped on it in reviews, but with the best will in the world, any album so harrowing that the appearance of gloom-laden vocalist Anohni constitutes a moment of light relief is going to be one that defies you to listen to it repeatedly. Utopia reanimates Vulnicura’s collaboration with Venezuela-born electronic auteur Arca, but is made of lighter material. Aside from his endlessly shifting soundscapes, distorted beats and penchant for sonic tapestries made from manipulated vocal samples, the album’s primary sound is woodwind, provided by an assembly of 12 female flautists from Reykjavik, which automatically lends it a far airier quality than the claustrophobic Vulnicura. It is, Björk says, her “Tinder album”, and its advance billing as a kind of Songs for Swinging Bachelorettes is borne out by its lyrics, which are obsessed both with technology and the vicissitudes of budding romance. “Is this excess texting blessing?” ponders Blissing Me, the saga of “two music nerds … sending each other MP3s”, before reverting to grief: “our physical union a fantasy, I just fell in love with a song”.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The most exasperated he ever gets is when Hartlepool are drubbed and, even then, he usually bears it with the fatalism of the long-suffering supporter. This week, however, the Sky Sports presenter has starred in a much-shared clip in which he goes on an actual rant. And the subject? Expected goals. In the run-up to their coverage of the north London derby, Stelling observed to his Soccer Saturday pundits that Arsène Wenger had done a daft thing. “He quoted expected goals!” Stelling said to an audible “No!” from one of his guests (perhaps Phil Thompson). “He’s the first person I’ve ever heard take any notice of expected goals, which must be the most useless stat in the history of football! What does it tell you? The game’s finished 3-1, why do you show expected goals afterwards?” Stelling’s remarks prompted much laughter in the studio and, after Soccer AM took a grab of the video, it got a lot of chuckles online, too.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The most exasperated he ever gets is when Hartlepool are drubbed and, even then, he usually bears it with the fatalism of the long-suffering supporter. This week, however, the Sky Sports presenter has starred in a much-shared clip in which he goes on an actual rant. And the subject? Expected goals. In the run-up to their coverage of the north London derby, Stelling observed to his Soccer Saturday pundits that Arsène Wenger had done a daft thing. “He quoted expected goals!” Stelling said to an audible “No!” from one of his guests (perhaps Phil Thompson). “He’s the first person I’ve ever heard take any notice of expected goals, which must be the most useless stat in the history of football! What does it tell you? The game’s finished 3-1, why do you show expected goals afterwards?” Stelling’s remarks prompted much laughter in the studio and, after Soccer AM took a grab of the video, it got a lot of chuckles online, too.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Conservative MPs have countered Jeremy Corbyn’s swingeing criticism of the budget as the work of “a government no longer fit for office” with a broad endorsement of Philip Hammond, in sharp contrast to their open reservations about the chancellor’s plans last year. Hammond’s colleagues used the first of four days of scheduled debate about the budget to praise not just his high-profile announcements on housing, but also his commitment of £3bn to prepare for any Brexit eventuality. In his response to the budget, Corbyn – it is the leader of the opposition who traditionally speaks rather than the shadow chancellor – said Hammond had completely failed to tackle a national crisis of stagnation and falling wages. “The test of a budget is how it affects the reality of people’s lives all around this country,” the Labour leader said. “And I believe as the days go ahead, and this budget unravels, the reality will be – a lot of people will be no better off. And the misery that many are in will be continuing.” Largely eschewing direct focus on Hammond’s specific announcements in favour of a broader critique of the government’s wider economic approach, Corbyn castigated Hammond for again missing deficit reduction targets, and for a continued spending squeeze on schools and the police. Speaking about housing, Corbyn said rough sleeping had doubled since 2010, and that this Christmas 120,000 children would be living in temporary accommodation. “We need a large-scale publicly funded housebuilding programme, not this government’s accounting tricks and empty promises.”Summing up, he said: “We were promised a revolutionary budget. The reality is nothing has changed. People were looking for help from this budget.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Moffat assured parents that the school aims to promote `freedom of speech` while not indulging in discriminatory beliefs.\"\n}\n```",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n England are pencilled in to play Ireland in Dublin next autumn under the auspices of a new Six Nations tournament to increase the strength of northern hemisphere rugby league. The tournament is provisionally on the Rugby League International Federation’s calendar and would comprise the same participants as rugby union’s Six Nations in 2018. Of those six, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France and Italy were eliminated in the group stages of the current Rugby League World Cup, while England face Tonga in a semi-final on Saturday. Richard Egan, the chairman of Rugby League Ireland, told the Guardian: “The provisional RLIF fixtures at the minute show that there is a Six Nations next year. It’s unconfirmed at the minute, though, and that’s where I have issues in developing the sport here. “In other sports you can buy tickets years in advance but I can’t guarantee what fixtures I’ve got to sell next year.” It is unclear when the RLIF plan to announce the details officially, though the tournament should take place in October and November, following the conclusion of the domestic season. However, that clashes with England’s three-Test series against New Zealand next autumn, details of which the Rugby Football League confirmed on Tuesday. That lends weight to the suggestion that the England Knights concept – an emerging talent side similar to union’s England Saxons – may return to play in the tournament. Egan, however, would be keen to see the strongest England side possible travel to Ireland to play in Dublin. He said: “We’re down for a provisional fixture against England in the capital and a game against Italy here, but if it’s an England B team that doesn’t work for me.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n England are pencilled in to play Ireland in Dublin next autumn under the auspices of a new Six Nations tournament to increase the strength of northern hemisphere rugby league. The tournament is provisionally on the Rugby League International Federation’s calendar and would comprise the same participants as rugby union’s Six Nations in 2018. Of those six, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France and Italy were eliminated in the group stages of the current Rugby League World Cup, while England face Tonga in a semi-final on Saturday. Richard Egan, the chairman of Rugby League Ireland, told the Guardian: “The provisional RLIF fixtures at the minute show that there is a Six Nations next year. It’s unconfirmed at the minute, though, and that’s where I have issues in developing the sport here. “In other sports you can buy tickets years in advance but I can’t guarantee what fixtures I’ve got to sell next year.” It is unclear when the RLIF plan to announce the details officially, though the tournament should take place in October and November, following the conclusion of the domestic season. However, that clashes with England’s three-Test series against New Zealand next autumn, details of which the Rugby Football League confirmed on Tuesday. That lends weight to the suggestion that the England Knights concept – an emerging talent side similar to union’s England Saxons – may return to play in the tournament. Egan, however, would be keen to see the strongest England side possible travel to Ireland to play in Dublin. He said: “We’re down for a provisional fixture against England in the capital and a game against Italy here, but if it’s an England B team that doesn’t work for me.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Most of season one’s more memorable characters return, including Dave Franco’s scam artist Jeff, and Kyle and Andi (Michael Chernus and Elizabeth Reaser), who are considering an open marriage. Available from 1 December, Netflix The Robot Will See You Now A whole week of bot-related programming from Channel 4 that explores sex-bots, driver-bots and, in the case of this documentary, empathy-bots. A glimpse of what’s looking like a weird future. 28 November, 10pm, Channel 4 Dark “Yesterday, today and tomorrow are not consecutive.” This enigmatic statement is a clue to where Netflix’s first German original is going. Shades of French mystery Les Revenants as the disappearance of two children gives rise to all manner of temporal bewilderment. Available from 1 December, Netflix Joe Orton Laid Bare The 1967 murder of the playwright Orton – by his partner Kenneth Halliwell – robbed us of a thrilling, flourishing literary talent. Fifty years on, this documentary looks back on Orton’s sadly brief career and airs an unpublished “pornographic” playlet for the first time. 25 November, 9pm, BBC Two The X Factor The singing contest-cum-Syco marketing campaign continues. Rak-Su remain favourites but Kevin Davy White will want a say, too.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n New nuclear power stations in the UK can no longer compete with windfarms on price, according to the boss of a German energy company’s green power arm. Hans Bunting, the chief operating officer of renewables at Innogy SE, part of the company that owns the UK energy supplier npower, said offshore windfarms had become mainstream and were destined to become even cheaper because of new, bigger turbines. Asked whether nuclear groups that want to build new reactors in the UK could compete with windfarms on cost, even when their intermittency was taken into account, Bunting replied: “Obviously they can’t.” His comments came after MPs criticised the £30bn cost to consumers for EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and said ministers should revisit the case for new nuclear before proceeding with more projects. Innogy recently secured a subsidy of £74.75 per megawatt hour of power to build a windfarm off the Lincolnshire coast, which is £17.75 cheaper than Hinkley and should be completed about three years earlier. “What we see now [with prices] is with today’s technology. It’s not about tomorrow’s technology, which is about [to come in] 2025, 2027, when Hinkley will most likely come to the grid ... and then it [windfarms] will be even cheaper.” While the company is planning to use the most powerful turbines in the world today for the Lincolnshire windfarm, Bunting said even bigger ones in development would drive costs down further. “A few years ago everyone thought 10MW [turbines] was the maximum, now we’re talking about 15[MW]. It seems the sky is the limit,” he said. “[It] means less turbines for the same capacity, less steel in the ground, less cables, even bigger rotors catching more wind, so it will become cheaper.” However, EDF argued that nuclear was also on a path to lower costs. “Early offshore wind projects started at around £150 per MW\/h and developers have shown they can offer lower prices by repeating projects with an established supply chain – the same is true for nuclear,” an EDF spokesman said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.
