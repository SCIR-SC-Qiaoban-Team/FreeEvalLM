The crumbling, graffiti-covered buildings are overgrown with creepers. The only human visitors to the 70-acre site in Vaimaanga pay a small fee to explore what has become known as the biggest white elephant in the South Pacific. The Italian-backed hotel project, which began in the late 1980s, was designed to revolutionise tourism in the remote Cook Islands by providing the tiny nation with its first five-star resort. But the house of cards collapsed at the 11th hour, with the project 80% complete, amid allegations of mafia involvement and money laundering back in Italy. The Cook Islands government was left with a debt of $120m and was almost bankrupted. In the years since, repeated attempts to finish the project have foundered, but now a new effort to salvage the buildings is under way, and could have an even bigger impact on the tiny Pacific state than the original plans were expected to. Tim Tepaki, a Cook Islander who has been involved in property development in New Zealand, claims to have hundreds of millions of dollars in Chinese backing. He hopes to rebuild the complex and turn the Pacific backwater into a favourite destination for tourists from China. Until now tourism in the Cooks – a nation of 15 islands scattered across an area the size of India – has relied mainly on visitors from Australia and New Zealand, who tend to focus on the capital Rarotonga and the atoll of Aitutaki, a 50-minute flight north.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"<<The Cursed Sheraton Hotel Complex: A Ghostly Tourist Attraction>>\n\nThe abandoned Sheraton hotel complex in Rarotonga, a South Pacific island, has been slowly devouring by the jungle for nearly a quarter of a century. This 70-acre site, once a luxury resort, has become a fascinating tourist attraction, albeit an eerie one.

However, allegations of mafia involvement and money laundering in Italy derailed the project when it was 80% complete.

Tim Tepaki, a Cook Islander with experience in property development, claims to have secured hundreds of millions of dollars in Chinese backing to rebuild the complex. This could transform the Pacific island into a favorite destination for tourists from China and pave the way for a more diverse and sizeable tourist industry.\n\nThe proposed renovations could have a significant impact on the Cook Islands' economy and tourism industry.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Pauline Hanson has likened the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, to a “spoilt brat” for ruling out a deal with One Nation. Arriving in Bundaberg just as the Labor campaign left, Hanson, who remains the most visible One Nation asset in Queensland, despite not running in Saturday’s state election, lashed out at Palaszczuk’s continued criticism of the party. Palaszczuk’s insistence that Labor would rather go into opposition than form government with One Nation has become its strongest attack line against the Liberal National party, which is directly preferencing One Nation in 50 of the 61 seats it is running in, as well as admitting, indirectly, it would form government with One Nation, if necessary. The opposition leader, Tim Nicholls, who has previously said he would work with the parliament Queenslanders delivered, was unable to answer “yes or no” to the question of whether he would form government with One Nation on Tuesday during a radio quiz, instead opting for “pass”. Hanson has responded with the line that the major parties are choosing not to respect the will of the people, in the same way Donald Trump’s campaign used Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment against the Democrat campaign last year. “I don’t think the premier knows what she is doing actually, I think she is in such a turmoil over this and she is actually needs to get out of the sandpit and be the leader for this state,” Hanson said. “Because the way she is carrying on, it is not leadership, it is not quality. “To say you won’t work with One Nation, it is just ridiculous. It’s like a spoilt brat, she is carrying on like a spoilt kid, and if that is what leadership means then I think she is heading down the wrong path and Tim Nicholls, he needs to grow up and make a decision, because people want clear decision in this state.

It’s been brought to my attention that I have made some of you feel disrespected or uncomfortable. That was never my intent.” Lasseter, who is one of the founders of Pixar and the director of Toy Story, also apologizes for letting employees down while adding more details about the conduct that has led to him taking a sabbatical. “I especially want to apologize to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form,” he writes. “No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.” In a statement, a Disney spokesperson responded: “We are committed to maintaining an environment in which all employees are respected and empowered to do their best work. We appreciate John’s candor and sincere apology and fully support his sabbatical.” The memo has arrived at the same time as an investigation by the Hollywood Reporter into complaints about Lasseter’s behavior.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

That was never my intent.” Lasseter, who is one of the founders of Pixar and the director of Toy Story, also apologizes for letting employees down while adding more details about the conduct that has led to him taking a sabbatical. “I especially want to apologize to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form,” he writes. “No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.” In a statement, a Disney spokesperson responded: “We are committed to maintaining an environment in which all employees are respected and empowered to do their best work. We appreciate John’s candor and sincere apology and fully support his sabbatical.” The memo has arrived at the same time as an investigation by the Hollywood Reporter into complaints about Lasseter’s behavior.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Australia’s race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, says the high no vote in western Sydney in last week’s historic same-sex marriage postal survey reflects religious observance rather than ethnicity, and he has warned against an outbreak of crass, cultural stereotyping. Soutphommasane used a speech at the University of Western Sydney to issue a pointed warning against adopting “easy narratives” devoid of evidence about the behaviour or inclinations of particular ethnic groups in Australia. “In a world that many describe as post-truth or post-factual, our social cohesion is not always well served by jumping to conclusions,” he said. “Once-appealing narratives take hold, they can help fuel stereotypes about others – and these can be difficult to shake off. Sometimes this is because they may conveniently help to confirm cultural hierarchies in our society.” Soutphommasane said a narrative has sprung up since the postal survey which centres on ethnic minorities or multicultural communities being intrinsically hostile towards same-sex marriage, and to the LGBTI community at large. He said while some ethnic communities hold to the view that marriage is between a man and a woman, that view is shaped often by religious or cultural traditions. The race commissioner said a more clear-eyed examination of the postal survey data suggests religiosity, or religious observance, was a more significant factor for no voters – a fact well understood by the no campaign, which targeted messages to a range of communities in Sydney’s west. Soutphommasane said if you look at the voting trends outside western Sydney, a more mixed picture emerges – a picture where seats with populations of more than 40% born overseas overwhelmingly voted yes. He pointed out that the most multicultural electorates in New South Wales and Victoria recorded high yes votes – seats like Sydney, Grayndler, Kingsford Smith, Bradfield, Batman, Wills, Gellibrand and Chisholm. “To suggest that an overwhelming majority of multicultural communities voted no – and did so out of some essential cultural hostility against gays and lesbians – is to entertain something that comes close to an unkind stereotype,” the race commissioner said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

A case in point was Mugabe’s controversial indigenisation law, which required all foreign companies to be controlled by Zimbabweans and was a particular blow to Chinese interests in its diamond industry. “I imagine there are quite a lot of officials in Beijing who will be happy to see Mugabe go,” Anthony said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Patients are being put at risk because doctors are giving them drugs they do not need and sending them for unnecessary surgery to avoid a complaint being made against them, research has revealed. Medics are so scared of being complained about that they are also giving patients more tests than their symptoms merit and not performing procedures that involve more risk than usual. Four out of five doctors who become the subject of a complaint find the experience so stressful that they start practising more “defensive medicine” than before, according to a survey of 6,144 doctors in Britain about whom a patient, relative or colleague had complained. “This involved ‘hedging’, which includes performing more tests than necessary, over-referral and overprescribing as well as ‘avoidance’, which includes avoiding procedures, not accepting high-risk patients or abandoning procedures early,” according to research by a team led by Prof Tom Bourne of Imperial College London, whose findings have been published in the journal BMJ Open. “These behaviours may have a serious impact on patient care,” they warned. While litigation, complaints and investigations are intended to protect patients from poor care and medical negligence, the “burden and stress associated with these processes are clearly having unintended consequences and it may be argued that when examined as a whole, these structures may be causing more harm to patient care than good,” the study said. “While the regulatory system may protect patients from the misconduct of a relatively small number of doctors, it has a perverse effect on the majority of doctors who become preoccupied by defensive practice,” it added. Doctors who resort to “fear-driven working practices that could compromise patient care” also waste vital resources and their conduct “creates significant costs for the NHS”, the co-authors added. Bourne could not quantify how much NHS spending goes on that, but pointed to a study that found such practices accounted for 10% of Italy’s health budget. The General Medical Council, which regulates Britain’s 250,000 doctors, receives 9,000-10,000 complaints a year.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The General Medical Council, which regulates Britain’s 250,000 doctors, receives 9,000-10,000 complaints a year.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"<<Stormy Healthcare>> \n\n*** \n\nSECTION 1\nA recent study by Prof Tom Bourne and his team at Imperial College London revealed that doctors in Britain are adopting \"defensive medicine\" out of fear of being complained about. This disturbing trend includes over-prescription of unnecessary drugs, sending patients for unnecessary surgeries, ordering more tests than their symptoms warrant, and avoiding procedures that pose more risk than usual. The stress of facing complaints has become so overwhelming that out of every five doctors who becomes the subject of a complaint, four tend to adopt more aggressive defensive practices.\n\nSECTION 2\nA storm is brewing in the UK's healthcare system due to this nationwide problem. Medics across Britain, with over 2.5 million patients, find themselves entangled in fear-driven working practices that compromise patient care and lead to significant costs for the National Health Service (NHS). With 9,000 to 10,000 complaints lodged against the General Medical Council annually, the healthcare system is presented with the challenge of tackling the issue at hand and mitigating the harm done to patient care.\n\nSECTION 3\nThough there isn't a clear figure for the NHS spending entangled in such practices, data from a study conducted in Italy suggests that defensive medicine caused an estimated 10% of Italy's health budget to go unaccounted for, sparking concerns for similar spending patterns in Britain. While these practices may be wasting vital NHS resources, tonight the UK's healthcare system will still be green, existing in a moral gray area torn between providing care and protecting medics from being complained about.\n\nSECTION 4\nIn light of this ongoing saga, the British healthcare system will have to tackle this green thunderstorm through comprehensive reform. Because there isn't clarity on the legislation preventing fear-driven practices and discovering workable solutions to outweigh the ethical weight they carry, the strain upon healthcare will demand simple steps for minimizing complaints from patients while reinforcing healthy conduct and dialogue among medical practitioners in Britain's healthcare systems.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Nick Xenophon Team senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore will resign from the Senate because she has dual British citizenship by descent through her mother. At a press conference in Adelaide on Wednesday, Kakoschke-Moore announced she had received advice from the UK Home Office on Friday, confirmed by a specialist barrister, that she had received British citizenship from her mother, who was born in Singapore in 1957. Kakoschke-Moore had always believed she was not British because her father had received advice from the British embassy in Oman she was not eligible for citizenship when she was 12. She said she was “heartbroken” to discover she was British, which she described as “extremely surprising” because she “had no reason to believe I was a British citizen until that point”. Kakoschke-Moore explained that her mother was born in Singapore, a former British colony, which gave her “citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies” and became a British citizen in 1983 when the British Nationality Act came into effect. Kakoschke-Moore, born in Darwin in 1985, then gained that citizenship by descent. Kakoschke-Moore said she would request the matter be referred to the high court to determine how the vacancy would be filled, adding she would “continue to run” for the NXT and “at this stage” her ambition was to come back to the Senate. A recount of the 2016 Senate election would likely elect the NXT candidate Tim Storrer, who unsuccessfully attempted to replace Xenophon in the Senate by challenging the party’s chosen successor. Xenophon said he and his colleagues were “devastated” by the loss of Kakoschke-Moore from the Senate, but predicted it was “not the end of her political career”. Xenophon said the party had preliminary legal advice the position may not be filled by a recount, claiming the situation was “uncharted legal territory” because of the high court’s recent decision involving Hollie Hughes.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Speaking at his Papitalai parish church on Los Negros Island, across a small bay from the detention centre, Taulam said the enforced shutdown of the centre – in which 380 men remain – had left people vulnerable and suffering. Over years of pastoral care, he has built up friendships with many of those in the centre, he told the Guardian and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. “Now when they say they have no food, no water, no lights, they are deprived physically but they are saying too, that the physical is also spiritual for them. They are deprived of faith. They are suffering.” Taulam said no government seemed willing to take care of the men who remain in the centre. “Australia seems to be saying, ‘Papua New Guinea, this is your responsibility’.

Ruddock’s appointment by cabinet, announced on Wednesday, is designed to head off a bruising debate about religious amendments in a same-sex marriage bill, but the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the review was “no substitute” for those amendments. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said it was important to look at the issue of religious freedom carefully, in light of the yes vote and impending legislation on marriage equality. While senior conservatives including Peter Dutton and Mathias Cormann have publicly suggested a religious freedom bill can be considered next year, separately to a marriage bill, others including Morrison and Liberal senator, David Fawcett, have insisted it be considered at the same time. Ruddock has been asked to report by 31 March. Turnbull said a variety of proposals for legislative changes to protect freedom of religion have been put forward in recent months but many of them go beyond the immediate issue of marriage, and parliament needed to be wary of them. “Any reforms to protect religious freedom at large should be undertaken carefully,” he said in a statement on Wednesday. “There is a high risk of unintended consequences when parliament attempts to legislate protections for basic rights and freedoms, such as freedom of religion. The government is particularly concerned to prevent uncertainties caused by generally worded bill of rights-style declarations. “This will be a timely expert stocktake to inform consideration of any necessary legislative reforms.” Turnbull said Ruddock was the right person to conduct the review because he had served as Australia’s special envoy for human rights.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

However, others, including Treasurer Scott Morrison and Liberal senator David Fawcett, have insisted that the two issues should be considered together.\n\nAs part of this ongoing discussion, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has emphasized the importance of approaching the issue of religious freedom with caution. Turnbull noted that various proposals for legislative changes to protect freedom of religion have been put forward, but many of these proposals go beyond the immediate issue of marriage.\n\nIn particular, Turnbull expressed concern about the potential for \"unintended consequences\" when parliament attempts to legislate protections for basic rights and freedoms, such as freedom of religion. He also highlighted the risk of uncertainty caused by broadly worded declarations of human rights.\n\nRuddock's review is expected to report by 31 March, providing expert analysis and informing the government's consideration of any necessary legislative reforms. Ruddock's appointment was seen as a key move to head off a potentially divisive debate, and the minister has served as Australia's special envoy for human rights in the past. ***",

    "response":"Unfortunately, based on the provided sentences, it seems that there is no informative or serious news content within the article. The sentences appear to be satirical and humorous, likely criticizing food television shows and their presenters. \n\nThe article mentions a 'Deathless celebration of all things banter,' a phrase that suggests a sarcastic commentary on the indulgent tone and storytelling style often present in television cooking programs. The description of \"Scallops in chino runoff\" and \"Steak in Lynx Sport Blast reduction\" might be a creative way of highlighting the overused and clichéd nature of certain cooking show recipes.\n\nThe presence of character Tim Lovejoy in \"distressed chambray\" saying \"yeah\" and the phenomena of \"unhappy men folding their arms and rocking with mirthless laughter\" gives the impression that the writers are poking fun at these repetitive behaviors found in cooking shows.\n\nThe writers also create a scene where a performer in a 'peephole codpiece' and mummers ducking for cover is used to lampoon the over-the-top characteristics of an annual festival known as 'The Costume Romp', without much understanding or perhaps even unapologetic mocking of this artistic display. \n\nIf we look further into this \"Costume Romp,\" it appears to be an additional satirical expression used to ridicule figure characters, wounds, injury  codpiece sanitised according to grandiose themes in that funny Biennial\/Costume Al fresco expressions.

It pokes fun at the overused and clichéd nature of certain cooking show recipes, such as 'Scallops in chino runoff' and 'Steak in Lynx Sport Blast reduction.' The article also targets the show's presenter, Tim Lovejoy, for his seemingly empty and hollow comments, represented by his repetitive responses of \"Yeah.\"\n\nThe article then shifts its focus to a satirical portrayal of a 'Costume Romp' festival, where participants engage in over-the-top artistic displays, including wearing risqué outfits with codpieces. This section might be commenting on the uncertainty surrounding artistic integrity and events, which could be seen as an annual romanticism figure of authority.

    "filtered_answer":"Unfortunately, based on the provided sentences, it seems that there is no informative or serious news content within the article. The sentences appear to be satirical and humorous, likely criticizing food television shows and their presenters. \n\nThe article mentions a 'Deathless celebration of all things banter,' a phrase that suggests a sarcastic commentary on the indulgent tone and storytelling style often present in television cooking programs. The description of \"Scallops in chino runoff\" and \"Steak in Lynx Sport Blast reduction\" might be a creative way of highlighting the overused and clichéd nature of certain cooking show recipes.\n\nThe presence of character Tim Lovejoy in \"distressed chambray\" saying \"yeah\" and the phenomena of \"unhappy men folding their arms and rocking with mirthless laughter\" gives the impression that the writers are poking fun at these repetitive behaviors found in cooking shows.\n\nThe writers also create a scene where a performer in a 'peephole codpiece' and mummers ducking for cover is used to lampoon the over-the-top characteristics of an annual festival known as 'The Costume Romp', without much understanding or perhaps even unapologetic mocking of this artistic display. \n\nIf we look further into this \"Costume Romp,\" it appears to be an additional satirical expression used to ridicule figure characters, wounds, injury  codpiece sanitised according to grandiose themes in that funny Biennial\/Costume Al fresco expressions.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Unity Spencer, who has died aged 87, was perhaps best known for being the daughter of the artist Stanley Spencer, but she was also a talented painter in her own right, a skilful realist with a powerful imaginative vision. Two of her best and most memorable works, which reveal her father’s influence, are a striking self-portrait from 1954, and a 1957 portrait of Stanley himself. She had three solo shows of her paintings in London, and contributed to many mixed exhibitions, from the London Group to the Royal Academy shows. The first of her one-person shows was at Lauderdale House in Highgate, in 1993, the second at the Boundary Gallery in St John’s Wood in 2001, both in north London, but it was the third that really established her reputation. In 2015, the Fine Art Society in Bond Street mounted the first West End exhibition of her work, to coincide with the publication of her autobiography, Lucky to Be an Artist. Fifty of her paintings from all periods were shown along with her etchings, accompanied by a group of pictures by her family: works by her parents, her uncles Gilbert Spencer and Richard Carline, and by her grandfather George Carline. This show came at the suggestion of a friend, the painter David Inshaw. He recalled visiting her house in Clapham (where, according to her son, she had inscribed “Daring, Joy and Love” on her bedroom wall), expecting to find it hung with paintings by herself and her parents. But the walls were oddly bare, with not even her own work in sight. The public has always been more interested in the Spencer\/Carline family’s eccentric lifestyle than in the art produced and Unity spent a substantial part of her life explaining if not defending her parents.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The furniture maker, which employs 547 people in 50 shops and manufactures upholstered furnishings in Thetford, Norfolk, has struggled amid a tough retail market in which shoppers are shying away from spending on expensive items for their homes. Multiyork had reportedly been put on the market by its major shareholder, the furnishings tycoon Charles Wade of Wade Furniture Group, which also owns beds maker Feather &amp; Black. The two brands are run as separate entities and the administration does not include the bed maker. Administrators said that Multiyork has fallen into financial difficulties as it could not meet its financial liabilities as a result of trading losses. The company had net debt of £1.9m at its 2016 year end, according to the latest accounts filed at Companies House. It recorded a profit of just £479,000 in the 53 weeks to 2 October 2016 after a £714,000 loss a year before. The company increased sales by 5.4% to £50.4m, partly thanks to an extra week’s trading on the year before. The brand, which was founded in 1978 and initially operated in the Old Mill site in the village of Mellis, Suffolk, was rescued from receivership by Wade in 1995. Allan Graham of Duff &amp; Phelps, who was appointed joint administrator on Tuesday, said the business would continue to run for a short period as administrators continue to look for a buyer.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"<<The Devastating Reality of Care Home Costs>>\n\n*** \nSelf-funders in the UK are facing significant financial obligations, which are often misrepresented in the media. According to a recent Guardian article, a common misconception is that local authorities (LAs) \"pick up the tab\" when a person's assets fall below a certain threshold. However, the reality is that LAs continue to take a larger share of a person's assets on a sliding scale until the amount reaches £14,250. \n\n*** \nA self-funder paying £1 for every £250 of their assets up to £23,250 before being allowed to retain the remaining amount is a woefully inadequate system. Moreover, their contributions do not end there; councils also claw back state and private pensions, while expecting families to pay top-up fees. This situation was highlighted by a writer whose mother has severe dementia and has paid over £250,000 in care home costs over the past four years.\n\n*** \nThe high cost of care homes is one of the major problems. The growing private sector's ability to charge self-funders high fees, especially when demand is high, puts a significant strain on their resources. This inevitably leads to a situation where a person's finances diminish rapidly, forcing the local authority to step in. The case of a writer's mother, who has had to sell her home and deplete her savings, is not an isolated incident.\n\n*** \nThe issue of care home costs is further complicated by the fact that UK care homes have become a lucrative investment opportunity for many. Historically, advertisements have encouraged investors from around the world to invest in UK care homes, promising high returns of 8%. However, this has resulted in care homes prioritizing profit over providing proper care, leaving many self-funders unable to afford their costs. The current system is a recipe for disaster, leaving many families facing financial hardship and long-term care costs.",

But with great pain comes great anger, and it's a chapter that Toney will likely never be able to fully close.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n At this stage in her career, no one expects Björk’s latest record to sound much like her last one. And yet it’s hard to avoid heaving a thankful sigh when Arisen My Senses, the opening track of her ninth studio album, Utopia, crashes into life: birdsong giving way to bright splashes of electronics, beatific-sounding harp chords and cascading beats not unlike the oft-sampled rhythm track of Schoolly D’s old rap classic PSK, What Does It Mean? It sounds positively ecstatic, which comes as a relief. Utopia’s predecessor, 2015’s Vulnicura, was a remarkable record, a latterday entry into the canon of legendary break-up albums. It attained its place alongside Marvin Gaye’s Here, My Dear and Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks by setting its fathomless misery to atonal string arrangements and abstract electronics that, during its central track, kept vanishing into a single flatlining beep. It was raw, brave, challenging, unique and all the other adjectives heaped on it in reviews, but with the best will in the world, any album so harrowing that the appearance of gloom-laden vocalist Anohni constitutes a moment of light relief is going to be one that defies you to listen to it repeatedly. Utopia reanimates Vulnicura’s collaboration with Venezuela-born electronic auteur Arca, but is made of lighter material. Aside from his endlessly shifting soundscapes, distorted beats and penchant for sonic tapestries made from manipulated vocal samples, the album’s primary sound is woodwind, provided by an assembly of 12 female flautists from Reykjavik, which automatically lends it a far airier quality than the claustrophobic Vulnicura. It is, Björk says, her “Tinder album”, and its advance billing as a kind of Songs for Swinging Bachelorettes is borne out by its lyrics, which are obsessed both with technology and the vicissitudes of budding romance. “Is this excess texting blessing?” ponders Blissing Me, the saga of “two music nerds … sending each other MP3s”, before reverting to grief: “our physical union a fantasy, I just fell in love with a song”.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Conservative MPs have countered Jeremy Corbyn’s swingeing criticism of the budget as the work of “a government no longer fit for office” with a broad endorsement of Philip Hammond, in sharp contrast to their open reservations about the chancellor’s plans last year. Hammond’s colleagues used the first of four days of scheduled debate about the budget to praise not just his high-profile announcements on housing, but also his commitment of £3bn to prepare for any Brexit eventuality. In his response to the budget, Corbyn – it is the leader of the opposition who traditionally speaks rather than the shadow chancellor – said Hammond had completely failed to tackle a national crisis of stagnation and falling wages. “The test of a budget is how it affects the reality of people’s lives all around this country,” the Labour leader said. “And I believe as the days go ahead, and this budget unravels, the reality will be – a lot of people will be no better off. And the misery that many are in will be continuing.” Largely eschewing direct focus on Hammond’s specific announcements in favour of a broader critique of the government’s wider economic approach, Corbyn castigated Hammond for again missing deficit reduction targets, and for a continued spending squeeze on schools and the police. Speaking about housing, Corbyn said rough sleeping had doubled since 2010, and that this Christmas 120,000 children would be living in temporary accommodation. “We need a large-scale publicly funded housebuilding programme, not this government’s accounting tricks and empty promises.”Summing up, he said: “We were promised a revolutionary budget. The reality is nothing has changed. People were looking for help from this budget.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Hammond’s colleagues used the first of four days of scheduled debate about the budget to praise not just his high-profile announcements on housing, but also his commitment of £3bn to prepare for any Brexit eventuality. In his response to the budget, Corbyn – it is the leader of the opposition who traditionally speaks rather than the shadow chancellor – said Hammond had completely failed to tackle a national crisis of stagnation and falling wages. “The test of a budget is how it affects the reality of people’s lives all around this country,” the Labour leader said. “And I believe as the days go ahead, and this budget unravels, the reality will be – a lot of people will be no better off. And the misery that many are in will be continuing.” Largely eschewing direct focus on Hammond’s specific announcements in favour of a broader critique of the government’s wider economic approach, Corbyn castigated Hammond for again missing deficit reduction targets, and for a continued spending squeeze on schools and the police. Speaking about housing, Corbyn said rough sleeping had doubled since 2010, and that this Christmas 120,000 children would be living in temporary accommodation. “We need a large-scale publicly funded housebuilding programme, not this government’s accounting tricks and empty promises.”Summing up, he said: “We were promised a revolutionary budget. The reality is nothing has changed. People were looking for help from this budget.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

An Argentinian navy spokesman, Captain Enrique Balbi, said search teams would return to the area about 30 miles north of the ARA San Juan’s last registered position after a “hydro-acoustic anomaly” was determined by the US and specialist agencies to have been produced just hours after the final contact with the submarine on 15 November. “It’s a noise.

Helena Alfaro was just one of many family members who congregated at the Mar del Plata naval base where the submarine was originally scheduled to arrive on Monday. “I feel like I’m waiting for a corpse,” said Alfaro, the sister of Cristian Ibañez, a radar officer on the missing submarine. “So much protocol, so much protocol,” she complained to TN news network, referring to the Argentinian navy’s long delay in advising the president, Mauricio Macri, that it had lost contact with the submarine. Justifying the delay, navy chiefs said that military protocol advises a 48-hour waiting period before beginning search efforts for submarines lost at sea. “I feel like I’m at a wake, that’s how I feel,” said a tearful Alfaro.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n A peace settlement to end the six-year Syrian civil war will require compromise by all sides, including the Assad government, Vladimir Putin has said as the presidents of Iran and Turkey arrived in the Black Sea resort of Sochi amid some of the most audacious Russian diplomatic activity in decades. The summit between the three powers, all deeply involved in the conflict, is designed to pave the way for a settlement likely to leave Syria’s Russian- and Iranian-backed president, Bashar al-Assad, in power within a reformed Syrian constitution. It follows the near-collapse of the Syrian opposition since Moscow’s armed intervention in 2015 and the military defeat of Islamic State in all of the major towns and cities that were under its control. “The militants in Syria have sustained a decisive blow and now there is a realistic chance to end the multi-year civil war,” Putin declared as he hosted Iran’s Hassan Rouhani and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Sochi. “The Syrian people will have to determine their own future and agree on the principles of their own statehood. It is obvious that the process of reform will not be easy and will require compromises and concessions from all participants, including of course the government of Syria.” Putin hosted Assad in Sochi on Monday and extracted a more emollient tone than normal. He insisted on Wednesday that Assad was committed to a peace process, constitutional reform and free elections. The Russian leader also held a frantic round of telephone diplomacy with other world leaders including Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump. Putin urged Iran and Turkey to start a discussion with him on the reconstruction of Syria. “Given the colossal scale of the destruction it would be possible to think together about the development of a comprehensive program for Syria,” he said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n A peace settlement to end the six-year Syrian civil war will require compromise by all sides, including the Assad government, Vladimir Putin has said as the presidents of Iran and Turkey arrived in the Black Sea resort of Sochi amid some of the most audacious Russian diplomatic activity in decades. The summit between the three powers, all deeply involved in the conflict, is designed to pave the way for a settlement likely to leave Syria’s Russian- and Iranian-backed president, Bashar al-Assad, in power within a reformed Syrian constitution. It follows the near-collapse of the Syrian opposition since Moscow’s armed intervention in 2015 and the military defeat of Islamic State in all of the major towns and cities that were under its control. “The militants in Syria have sustained a decisive blow and now there is a realistic chance to end the multi-year civil war,” Putin declared as he hosted Iran’s Hassan Rouhani and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Sochi. “The Syrian people will have to determine their own future and agree on the principles of their own statehood. It is obvious that the process of reform will not be easy and will require compromises and concessions from all participants, including of course the government of Syria.” Putin hosted Assad in Sochi on Monday and extracted a more emollient tone than normal. He insisted on Wednesday that Assad was committed to a peace process, constitutional reform and free elections. The Russian leader also held a frantic round of telephone diplomacy with other world leaders including Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump. Putin urged Iran and Turkey to start a discussion with him on the reconstruction of Syria. “Given the colossal scale of the destruction it would be possible to think together about the development of a comprehensive program for Syria,” he said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n England are pencilled in to play Ireland in Dublin next autumn under the auspices of a new Six Nations tournament to increase the strength of northern hemisphere rugby league. The tournament is provisionally on the Rugby League International Federation’s calendar and would comprise the same participants as rugby union’s Six Nations in 2018. Of those six, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France and Italy were eliminated in the group stages of the current Rugby League World Cup, while England face Tonga in a semi-final on Saturday. Richard Egan, the chairman of Rugby League Ireland, told the Guardian: “The provisional RLIF fixtures at the minute show that there is a Six Nations next year. It’s unconfirmed at the minute, though, and that’s where I have issues in developing the sport here. “In other sports you can buy tickets years in advance but I can’t guarantee what fixtures I’ve got to sell next year.” It is unclear when the RLIF plan to announce the details officially, though the tournament should take place in October and November, following the conclusion of the domestic season. However, that clashes with England’s three-Test series against New Zealand next autumn, details of which the Rugby Football League confirmed on Tuesday. That lends weight to the suggestion that the England Knights concept – an emerging talent side similar to union’s England Saxons – may return to play in the tournament. Egan, however, would be keen to see the strongest England side possible travel to Ireland to play in Dublin. He said: “We’re down for a provisional fixture against England in the capital and a game against Italy here, but if it’s an England B team that doesn’t work for me.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n England are pencilled in to play Ireland in Dublin next autumn under the auspices of a new Six Nations tournament to increase the strength of northern hemisphere rugby league. The tournament is provisionally on the Rugby League International Federation’s calendar and would comprise the same participants as rugby union’s Six Nations in 2018. Of those six, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France and Italy were eliminated in the group stages of the current Rugby League World Cup, while England face Tonga in a semi-final on Saturday. Richard Egan, the chairman of Rugby League Ireland, told the Guardian: “The provisional RLIF fixtures at the minute show that there is a Six Nations next year. It’s unconfirmed at the minute, though, and that’s where I have issues in developing the sport here. “In other sports you can buy tickets years in advance but I can’t guarantee what fixtures I’ve got to sell next year.” It is unclear when the RLIF plan to announce the details officially, though the tournament should take place in October and November, following the conclusion of the domestic season. However, that clashes with England’s three-Test series against New Zealand next autumn, details of which the Rugby Football League confirmed on Tuesday. That lends weight to the suggestion that the England Knights concept – an emerging talent side similar to union’s England Saxons – may return to play in the tournament. Egan, however, would be keen to see the strongest England side possible travel to Ireland to play in Dublin. He said: “We’re down for a provisional fixture against England in the capital and a game against Italy here, but if it’s an England B team that doesn’t work for me.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n New nuclear power stations in the UK can no longer compete with windfarms on price, according to the boss of a German energy company’s green power arm. Hans Bunting, the chief operating officer of renewables at Innogy SE, part of the company that owns the UK energy supplier npower, said offshore windfarms had become mainstream and were destined to become even cheaper because of new, bigger turbines. Asked whether nuclear groups that want to build new reactors in the UK could compete with windfarms on cost, even when their intermittency was taken into account, Bunting replied: “Obviously they can’t.” His comments came after MPs criticised the £30bn cost to consumers for EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and said ministers should revisit the case for new nuclear before proceeding with more projects. Innogy recently secured a subsidy of £74.75 per megawatt hour of power to build a windfarm off the Lincolnshire coast, which is £17.75 cheaper than Hinkley and should be completed about three years earlier. “What we see now [with prices] is with today’s technology. It’s not about tomorrow’s technology, which is about [to come in] 2025, 2027, when Hinkley will most likely come to the grid ... and then it [windfarms] will be even cheaper.” While the company is planning to use the most powerful turbines in the world today for the Lincolnshire windfarm, Bunting said even bigger ones in development would drive costs down further. “A few years ago everyone thought 10MW [turbines] was the maximum, now we’re talking about 15[MW]. It seems the sky is the limit,” he said. “[It] means less turbines for the same capacity, less steel in the ground, less cables, even bigger rotors catching more wind, so it will become cheaper.” However, EDF argued that nuclear was also on a path to lower costs. “Early offshore wind projects started at around £150 per MW\/h and developers have shown they can offer lower prices by repeating projects with an established supply chain – the same is true for nuclear,” an EDF spokesman said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.
