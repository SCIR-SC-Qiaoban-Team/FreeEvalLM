      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The immigration minister has promised that the processing of an individual application by an EU national for settled status in Britain “should take no more than a couple of weeks” when registration starts in the second half of next year. The minister, Brandon Lewis, told the Commons home affairs select committee that an extra 1,200 UK visas and immigration staff were being recruited to process an expected 3.5m applications from EU nationals over two and a half years. He also told MPs on Tuesday that he was optimistic that an agreement could be struck by Christmas on the rights of EU citizens in the UK in the Brexit negotiations. However, he declined to comment on reports that the Brexit inner cabinet had decided on Monday that the European court of justice could continue to play a role in guaranteeing their rights during a two-year transition period. The Home Office minister did confirm that those refused “settled status” and classed as non-EU nationals in Britain illegally could have their bank accounts frozen and face deportation before the hearing of any appeal in British courts. The 3million group, representing EU nationals in Britain, immediately questioned Lewis’s claim that an agreement with the EU on “settled status” was likely before Christmas. “We wonder how. Major stumbling blocks still in place,” they tweeted, noting continued differences over the role of the ECJ, over family reunification rights that could affect thousands, and regarding clarification that they should not face “hostile environment measures”. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, voiced scepticism that an extra 1,200 staff – of whom 700 had already been recruited – would be sufficient when the UK Visas and Immigration agency (UKVI) currently used 6,500 staff to process 3m visa applications a year. There was already a three-month delay in processing EU nationals’ applications for permanent residence documents, she said.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Not in the strictly financial sense, though how much more threadbare core public services can become without collapsing and causing social mayhem the next few years will prove, if the government lasts. Even with faltering economic growth, public spending is to go on falling as a proportion of GDP. It’s bankrupt in ideas, in understanding, in preparedness to examine what has been happening to public services. Housing offers a glaring example. For all the bells and whistles in the budget, and some welcome augmentation of council powers, the government fails to make an obvious connexion. Building houses, allocating land, encouraging development, and policing the delinquency of private developers all imply an active and financially lubricated local government. Housing is and always will be about places, streets, brownfields – and public acceptance of schemes that will abut on their property or where they walk their dog. That’s what councillors do. Ace ideologue of the free market Oliver Letwin, of all people, can’t substitute.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n This is a bankrupt budget. Not in the strictly financial sense, though how much more threadbare core public services can become without collapsing and causing social mayhem the next few years will prove, if the government lasts. Even with faltering economic growth, public spending is to go on falling as a proportion of GDP. It’s bankrupt in ideas, in understanding, in preparedness to examine what has been happening to public services. Housing offers a glaring example. For all the bells and whistles in the budget, and some welcome augmentation of council powers, the government fails to make an obvious connexion. Building houses, allocating land, encouraging development, and policing the delinquency of private developers all imply an active and financially lubricated local government. Housing is and always will be about places, streets, brownfields – and public acceptance of schemes that will abut on their property or where they walk their dog. That’s what councillors do. Ace ideologue of the free market Oliver Letwin, of all people, can’t substitute.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"\"Government's Housing Policy Shows Signs of Bankruptcy, Critics Argue\"\n\n* * *\n\n\"SECTION 1\nThe Guardian has published an incisive critique on the government's recent budget, pointing out its significant shortcomings in the area of housing. Critics argue that the budget is 'bankrupt in ideas,' suggesting a lack of coherent strategy to address current and future housing needs. The core of the argument lies in the disconnect between the positive rhetoric about local council powers and the broader failure to address fundamental issues such as land allocation and private developer oversight.\n\n* * *\n\nSECTION 2\nThe article criticizes the failure to recognize the interconnectedness of housing policies with local governance. Building houses and managing developments are seen as responsibilities that require active and well-funded local government intervention. This oversight extends to ensuring that new developments do not disrupt existing communities and that there is public acceptance of these changes. The government's approach appears to prioritize ideological free-market principles over practical, community-oriented solutions.\n\n* * *\n\nSECTION 3\nThis critique comes from a report that highlights a disconnect between high-level policy and grassroots realities. The author, presumably an expert in urban planning or housing policy, emphasizes the importance of local presence and acceptance in housing projects. The mention of Oliver Letwin, a proponent of free-market policies, further illustrates the tension between economic ideology and the need for robust, community-based governance strategies.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky has died aged 55. The news was announced on his Facebook page: “On behalf of the Hvorostovsky family, it is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Dmitri Hvorostovsky – beloved operatic baritone, husband, father, son, and friend – at age 55. After a two-and-a-half-year battle with brain cancer, he died peacefully this morning, November 22, surrounded by family near his home in London, UK. May the warmth of his voice and his spirit always be with us.” Hvorostovsky was born in a tough industrial city in Siberia, telling an interviewer in 2002 that as a high school student, prison looked a more likely destination than the opera stage, with “drinking, drugs and fighting,” part of his adolescence. A teenage obsession with pop music also almost claimed the singer for a different world, and his hard drinking and wild behaviour continued into his 20s and early 30s. He came to international attention in 1989 when he beat Bryn Terfel to win the Cardiff Singer of the World title. With his prematurely white hair, dashing good looks and powerful stage presence, his heartthrob image was carefully cultivated and he amassed legions of fans. A career performing in all the major opera houses and concert halls followed, and he was hailed one of the world’s greatest baritones for the rich, expressive fluidity of his voice. His fame allowed him to bring the neglected and little known Russian song repertoire into western halls, most notably with the remarkable accompanist Ivari Ilja. In the opera house he was particularly feted for his performances of Verdi, and also his charismatic and provocative interpretation of Tchaikovksy’s antihero Eugene Onegin, a role he made his own.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky has died aged 55. The news was announced on his Facebook page: “On behalf of the Hvorostovsky family, it is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Dmitri Hvorostovsky – beloved operatic baritone, husband, father, son, and friend – at age 55. After a two-and-a-half-year battle with brain cancer, he died peacefully this morning, November 22, surrounded by family near his home in London, UK. May the warmth of his voice and his spirit always be with us.” Hvorostovsky was born in a tough industrial city in Siberia, telling an interviewer in 2002 that as a high school student, prison looked a more likely destination than the opera stage, with “drinking, drugs and fighting,” part of his adolescence. A teenage obsession with pop music also almost claimed the singer for a different world, and his hard drinking and wild behaviour continued into his 20s and early 30s. He came to international attention in 1989 when he beat Bryn Terfel to win the Cardiff Singer of the World title. With his prematurely white hair, dashing good looks and powerful stage presence, his heartthrob image was carefully cultivated and he amassed legions of fans. A career performing in all the major opera houses and concert halls followed, and he was hailed one of the world’s greatest baritones for the rich, expressive fluidity of his voice. His fame allowed him to bring the neglected and little known Russian song repertoire into western halls, most notably with the remarkable accompanist Ivari Ilja. In the opera house he was particularly feted for his performances of Verdi, and also his charismatic and provocative interpretation of Tchaikovksy’s antihero Eugene Onegin, a role he made his own.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that the chancellor faced a long period of lower than expected wages growth that would dent tax receipts and push up borrowing. The cumulative effect over the life of the parliament would add £90.5bn to the UK’s debt pile and jeopardise Hammond’s target of balancing the government’s books by 2025, it said. The Treasury said that once the positive effects of an increase in employment and better than expected borrowing over the last year are taken into account, the net borrowing rise would be £35bn, putting the chancellor in a position to reach his target of creating a surplus in the middle of the next decade. But some analysts said the OBR’s revision failed to go far enough and it continued to overestimate the capacity of British businesses to invest in new equipment and processes to drive up productivity. They argued that the forecaster should have gone further and predicted that productivity growth – which measures the average output per hour worked – of almost zero over the last seven years would continue for another five years. Joanna Davies, a UK economist at Fathom Consulting, said the OBR’s new forecast that productivity would increase at a rate of 1.1% until 2022 – almost half the 2.1% average seen in the 30 years before 2007 – still looked ambitious. She said the prospects for GDP growth would suffer a severe knock-on effect from lower productivity and a rapidly ageing population. “Over the last five years, productivity growth has averaged just 0.3%,” she said. “Combined with UN projections for working-age population growth, the UK’s trend rate of overall economic growth is probably somewhere in the range 0.5%-1% – around half the 1.5% assumed by the OBR.” The OBR chair, Robert Chote, said GDP growth would not only be hit by lower productivity, but also a weaker than expected export sector that would fail to benefit significantly from the lower pound.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"In a surprising twist, the UK government’s fiscal goals have run aground on the shoals of lower-than-expected productivity growth and a diminishing tax base. Philip Hammond, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, now faces the daunting task of borrowing an extra £90.5 billion over the next five years to meet growing financial pressures. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which provides independent economic forecasts, this will contribute significantly to the swelling national debt, threatening Hammond’s aim to balance the books by 2025.\n\nThe OBR’s report paints a bleak picture, suggesting that lower-than-anticipated wage growth, coupled with a fragile economic climate characterized by underwhelming export sectors, could severely curtail GDP growth. This pessimistic outlook implies a stark reality for the British economy, where the ability to both service and pay down existing national debt will be decisively tested. Hammond’s original target now seems increasingly out of reach, as OBR forecasts indicate an over-estimation in the nation’s capacity for productivity enhancement, a key factor in driving economic growth.\n\nEconomists like Joanna Davies, a UK economist from Fathom Consulting, echo these concerns. She argues that recent productivity growth, averaging a meager 0.3% over the last five years, is unlikely to substantially diverge from these trends, further dampening prospects for GDP expansion. The pressing challenge of an aging population, combined with the OBR’s optimistic productivity forecast, leaves the door open for potential discrepancies between anticipated and actual economic performance.\n\nMoreover, the report highlights a significant downward revision in the OBR’s forecasts for public finances, suggesting that the Treasury’s consolation of a £35 billion net borrowing rise from employment and positive borrowing trends is a cause for concern. Analysts argue that a more accurate and conservative approach to economic uncertainty is necessary to maintain fiscal health and prepare for future economic downturns.\n\nThe OBR’s chair, Robert Chote, adds yet another layer of complexity, warning of the dual pressures on economic output—both from faltering productivity and a struggling export sector. In this context, Britain’s recent foray into international markets appears less profitable than expected, calling into question the strategic decisions guiding the country’s economic compass.\n\nThis economic quagmire raises questions about the sustainability of the UK’s fiscal policies and the resilience of its economy in the face of adverse global and domestic conditions. The road to fiscal stability now emerges as a strenuous climb, with Philip Hammond at the helm navigating through uncharted and potentially treacherous waters.\n\nP.P.S The forecasts and analyses presented here will undoubtedly be closely monitored by policymakers, economists, and financial analysts alike, as they navigate the uncertain economic environment that lies ahead.",

Hammond’s original target now seems increasingly out of reach, as OBR forecasts indicate an over-estimation in the nation’s capacity for productivity enhancement, a key factor in driving economic growth.\n\nEconomists like Joanna Davies, a UK economist from Fathom Consulting, echo these concerns. She argues that recent productivity growth, averaging a meager 0.3% over the last five years, is unlikely to substantially diverge from these trends, further dampening prospects for GDP expansion. The pressing challenge of an aging population, combined with the OBR’s optimistic productivity forecast, leaves the door open for potential discrepancies between anticipated and actual economic performance.\n\nMoreover, the report highlights a significant downward revision in the OBR’s forecasts for public finances, suggesting that the Treasury’s consolation of a £35 billion net borrowing rise from employment and positive borrowing trends is a cause for concern. Analysts argue that a more accurate and conservative approach to economic uncertainty is necessary to maintain fiscal health and prepare for future economic downturns.\n\nThe OBR’s chair, Robert Chote, adds yet another layer of complexity, warning of the dual pressures on economic output—both from faltering productivity and a struggling export sector. In this context, Britain’s recent foray into international markets appears less profitable than expected, calling into question the strategic decisions guiding the country’s economic compass.\n\nThis economic quagmire raises questions about the sustainability of the UK’s fiscal policies and the resilience of its economy in the face of adverse global and domestic conditions. The road to fiscal stability now emerges as a strenuous climb, with Philip Hammond at the helm navigating through uncharted and potentially treacherous waters.\n\nP.P.S The forecasts and analyses presented here will undoubtedly be closely monitored by policymakers, economists, and financial analysts alike, as they navigate the uncertain economic environment that lies ahead.",

An amendment to the European Union (withdrawal bill to transfer the EU protocol on animal sentience into UK law was defeated by 313 votes to 295 on 15 November, and since then a row has developed as to what the vote meant in practice. Describing some of the reporting on the vote as “weird and dishonest”, Tory MP Zac Goldsmith tweeted a clarification that the vote had been about the correct legal procedure for ensuring animal welfare standards – not on the principle of whether animals are sentient. Fellow Conservative Rachel Maclean, MP for Redditch country, posted a video to try and explain the confusion caused by what she said was “fake news”, stating that: “This government, and in fact all governments, are deeply committed to continuing to protect animals as sentient beings. That law is already written into our own law.” Theresa May said at Wednesday’s PMQs: “We recognise and respect that animals are sentient beings, and should be treated accordingly.” Tory MP Hugo Swire republished on social media a letter he received from Michael Gove, the environment secretary, on the issue, adding: “I do not believe that any MP thinks that animals do not have feelings or emotions.” Nevertheless, the vote has triggered protests from animal rights groups, including multiple online petitions aimed at the House of Lords, UK parliament and Gove. Public figures including the presenter Sue Perkins have voiced strong criticism of MPs over the issue. Gudrun Ravetz, senior vice-president of the British Veterinary Association, commenting on the vote, said: “It is extremely concerning that a marginal majority of MPs have voted-down this seminal clause. This action undermines the government’s previous promises that the UK will continue to be known for our high standards of animal health and welfare post-Brexit.” However, Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley, pointed out that EU law still allowed many practices across Europe that animal rights groups oppose. The amendment, proposed by the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas, among others, had set out to specifically incorporate article 13 of title II of the Lisbon treaty into UK law. During debate on the amendment last Wednesday, Lucas pointed out that the origins of the clause began with the 1997 UK presidency of the EU and that from 1999 EU law had explicitly recognised that animals were sentient life forms.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"Section 1\nKim Myhr, a renowned Norwegian musician celebrated for his mastery of slow-morphing rhythms and majestic textures, has recently gifted the world with \"You | Me,\" an exquisite album that embodies his signature style. This hauntingly beautiful piece is not your typical symphony—it's a warmly inviting soundscape that evokes the gentle embrace of a sunny day. On the surface, it seems like an album perfectly suited for summertime, but to Myhr's fans, it feels especially poignant for these autumnal months, reminding them of past sunlit days and serene moments.\n\nThe album is characterized by its twin, continuous tracks titled 'A' and 'B', which loop and shimmer around a single, soothing melody. The combination of Kim's 12-string acoustic guitar and electronic elements creates a blissful resonance that can be felt both physically and emotionally. The looped nature of the tracks mirrors the cyclical nature of life; they are as repetitive as they are mesmerizing, offering listeners a sense of continuity and order.\n\nThe addition of three drummers—Ingar Zach, Hans Hulbækmo, and Tony Buck from the Australian group The Necks—serves to enhance the album's pulse, punctuating the i.e. (intermittent) moments with additional layers of texture and rhythmic complexity. The drummers contribute delicate, sparkling, and occasionally somber interludes, providing a dynamic and expansive backdrop for the soaring harmonies of the instruments. Theirs is a subtle artistry, weaving in and out of the main melody with grace and precision, adding a layer of depth to the overall composition.\n\nAs sections of the album deliberate on different atmospheric moods, \"You | Me\" summons the spirit of 60s psych-folk, blending it with the intricate loop techniques of composers like Steve Reich and Terry Riley. There are also faint echoes of the joyful melodies of Julius Eastman, a forgotten name in the world of experimental music, whose music Kim Myhr seems to have inherited and modernized. This fusion of styles not only heightens the album’s appeal but also hints at its timeless quality, captivating the listener with its nostalgic warmth and innovative complexity.\n\nJim Hynes, a long-time collaborator and consistent fan of Kim Myhr, commented, \"This is the album that you want to have with you when you’re out in the open, scaling a mountain or floating down a river. It’s composed with that kind of majestic, open-world feeling in mind.\"\n\nSection 2\nP.S. The influence of Kim Myhr's recent album on the listener extends beyond mere auditory pleasure. It serves as a soundtrack for introspection and connection, grounding the nerves and bolstering the spirits. In a world rife with complexity and continuous change, \"You | Me\" is a beacon, reminding us of simpler times and universal human experiences that can transcend the boundaries of genre and time. It invites listeners to find their own unique path, one that is as subtly shifting as the rhythms in Myhr's music.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The name of this 1640 collection means “moral and spiritual forest” and it is Monteverdi in the most exploratory mood – the culmination of his three decades as maestro di cappella at St Mark’s Basilica in Venice, with its sumptuous acoustic and crack instrumental band and 40-piece choir to match. You’ll find everything from grand ensembles to intimate solo confessionals, and this recording is best suited to the latter. That’s because conductor Pablo Heras-Casado has a tendency to over-shape the bigger stuff, to traffic-control the corners and smooth out the ride. With Monteverdi, we need the rough and the spontaneous. But individual musicians and singers of the Balthasar Neumann are wonderful, and they shine in their nimble duos and trios – try the piercingly delivered Salve Regina from sopranos Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The name of this 1640 collection means “moral and spiritual forest” and it is Monteverdi in the most exploratory mood – the culmination of his three decades as maestro di cappella at St Mark’s Basilica in Venice, with its sumptuous acoustic and crack instrumental band and 40-piece choir to match. You’ll find everything from grand ensembles to intimate solo confessionals, and this recording is best suited to the latter. That’s because conductor Pablo Heras-Casado has a tendency to over-shape the bigger stuff, to traffic-control the corners and smooth out the ride. With Monteverdi, we need the rough and the spontaneous. But individual musicians and singers of the Balthasar Neumann are wonderful, and they shine in their nimble duos and trios – try the piercingly delivered Salve Regina from sopranos Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"In the heart of Venice, the name \"Il Bosco Morale ed Spirituale\" (The Moral and Spiritual Forest) echoes through the ages, marking the culmination of Claudio Monteverdi's extraordinary journey as maestro di cappella at St Mark's Basilica. This 1640 collection is not just a series of compositions; it is a musical journey through the spiritual and moral landscapes of the Renaissance, where grand ensembles blend seamlessly with intimate, confessional moments. Monteverdi, known for pushing the boundaries of his time, demonstrated his mastery in this collection, drawing from his three-decade tenure to create works that resonate deeply with listeners.\n\nConductor Pablo Heras-Casado, often criticized for shaping the larger ensemble pieces too intricately, finds a perfect balance with the solo and chamber performances. However, his approach to the grander arrangements sometimes overshadows the rough edges and spontaneous moments that make Monteverdi's work truly unique. This is where the Balthasar Neumann Ensemble comes into play, offering pristine interpretations that glow with vibrancy and clarity. The ensemble's instrumentalists and singers excel in nimble duos and trios, as demonstrated by the piercing performance of the Salve Regina by sopranos Magdalene Harer and Julia Kirchner. Their voices sting with purity and intensity, capturing the essence of Monteverdi's soulful confessions.\n\nThe contrast between the conductor's tendency to smooth out the ride and the desire for raw authenticity is a familiar yet insightful conversation within the realm of early music performances. It underscores the balance between interpretation and historical accuracy, reminding us that the tension between these forces often yields the most rewarding, moving performances. As Heras-Casado and the Balthasar Neumann Ensemble bring these pieces to life, they invite listeners on a journey through time, from the bustling piazzas of St Mark's Basilica to the quieter reflections of human spirit.\n\n***\n\nThe meticulous attention to detail and nuanced performances of the Balthasar Neumann Ensemble highlight the layers within Monteverdi's work. Every note is carefully chosen, every phrase poignantly delivered, to evoke the emotions and convey the spiritual messages intended by the composer. This recording, a product of the collaborative effort between the conductor and the ensemble, shines a light on the intricate interplay between structure and spontaneity in the world of early music. It invites listeners to experience the depth and complexity of Monteverdi's genius, allowing them to hear not just his music, but his soul.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has promised to donate part of her fee from appearing in I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here to a homeless charity as she defended her decision to appear in the show. Dugdale rejected complaints from her Labour colleagues at Holyrood that taking part in the ITV reality show was akin to taking a second job, but admitted she would be well paid for it. Speaking to show-business reporters in Australia for the first time since her participation provoked a backlash from other Labour MSPs, Dugdale insisted the show would allow her to connect with voters. She said she had set aside three weeks’ salary as an MSP for the Rock Trust homeless charity and not a motor neurone disease campaign as previously thought.

    "response":"In the heart of London, in the grand drawing room of a fashionable Wimpole Street home, the reverberations of Brahms’s German Requiem filled the air on a chilly autumn night in 1871. This was no ordinary performance; it was an intimate gathering of the city's elite, all rapt in the sacred sounds of classical music. The text of the Requiem, chosen consciously by Johannes Brahms in the German vernacular, spoke to the deep-hearted ideals of the composer. It was a language of profound human emotion that resonated with both the educated and the common folk.\n\nAs the performance reached its crescendo, the choir, composed of young voices, channelled the spirit of Brahms's text with heartfelt sincerity. The piano, played by two members of the audience in four hands, echoed the rich textures of the original orchestration, creating a chamber performance that was intimate and highly charged. The sound was both bright and powerful, a testament to the youthful vitality of the choir, yet there were occasional moments when the voices were sung too lightly, not fully capturing the weighty struggle of the text.\n\nThe evening went on until the stark beauty of the “Denn alles Fleisch” reached its zenith, and a young soprano named Mary Bevan stepped into the spotlight. Her solo was a beauty to behold, a divine spiritual journey that moved the souls of the audience. However, clouded diction marred the perfection of her performance, a silent dissonance that broke the spell. Despite this flaw, she undoubtedly delivered a performance that would be remembered for its purity and power.\n\nFast-forward to the 21st century, where a modern revival of this historic performance is being recorded. Like the original, this version uses similar forces—chamber choir, soloists, and a chamber orchestra approximation—to produce an audio record that captures the essence of the 1871 performance. The producers have taken the liberty of revising the piano part, aiming to more closely reflect the original orchestration of Brahms, hoping to evoke the same emotional resonance and intimacy as the original.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?\n\nP.P.S: This recording is not just a performance of Brahms's masterpiece but a journey through time, a connection between two eras, and a celebration of the enduring power of music.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Google has confirmed it has been able to track the location of Android users via the addresses of local mobile phone masts, even when location services were turned off and the sim cards removed to protect privacy. Revealed by a report by Quartz, Google’s Android system, which handles messaging services to ensure delivery of push notifications, began requesting the unique addresses of mobile phone masts (called Cell ID) at the beginning of 2017. The information was captured by the phone and routinely sent to Google by any modern Android device, even when location services were turned off and the sim card was removed. As a result Google could in theory track the location of the Android device and therefore the user, despite a reasonable expectation of privacy. A Google spokesperson said: “In January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery. “However, we never incorporated Cell ID into our network sync system, so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated it to no longer request Cell ID.” Google requested the Cell ID alongside what is called the mobile country code and mobile network code, which identify the country and mobile phone operator that the smartphone is using. That data is used to ensure the phone stays properly connected to Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging system, which handles the delivery of messages and notifications to the smartphone. A persistent connection is required for the system to work, but instead of staying constantly connected, the phone pings Google’s servers at set intervals. The more pings, the greater the battery drain, so the data collected about the country and mobile networks is used to work out the the minimum number of pings required to stay connected without draining the battery – so called heartbeat analysis. The benefit of having the address of the mobile phone mast to ensure message service reliability is not clear, but through a process of triangulation – the same used to assist when a user is actively using location services – the position of the user can be revealed down to a roughly 400m radius at a minimum, and often much more accurately in urban areas.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

It is a delectably gentle, elegant, self-effacing performance. Riva plays a lovably scatty old lady called Marthe in this Tati-esque comedy from French writer-directors Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon. The movie they have jointly devised, and in which they star, is a clever, funny and distinctly unworldly comedy with an insouciant line in visual humour. Fiona (Fiona Gordon) is a young goof from Canada who comes to Paris to visit her similarly away-with-the-fairies aunt Marthe (Riva). A mishap on the banks of, and then in, the Seine leads to an encounter with a romantic tramp called Dom (Dominique Abel). It’s a classic French entertainment that could have been produced almost any time in the last 60 years. There is a sophistication in its childlike guilelessness and also a cameo for veteran French comedy player Pierre Richard. This movie is as sweet-natured as Abel and Gordon’s debut film Rumba, and they break out some serious tango movies here, too. It’s a little gem.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['fire', 'meeting', 'quote', 'society', 'wheel'] in the response.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Here is one of the final screen appearances of Emmanuelle Riva, icon of movies from Michael Haneke’s Amour to Gillo Pontecorvo’s Kapò and Alain Resnais’s Hiroshima Mon Amour, who died in January at the age of 89. It is a delectably gentle, elegant, self-effacing performance. Riva plays a lovably scatty old lady called Marthe in this Tati-esque comedy from French writer-directors Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon. The movie they have jointly devised, and in which they star, is a clever, funny and distinctly unworldly comedy with an insouciant line in visual humour. Fiona (Fiona Gordon) is a young goof from Canada who comes to Paris to visit her similarly away-with-the-fairies aunt Marthe (Riva). A mishap on the banks of, and then in, the Seine leads to an encounter with a romantic tramp called Dom (Dominique Abel). It’s a classic French entertainment that could have been produced almost any time in the last 60 years. There is a sophistication in its childlike guilelessness and also a cameo for veteran French comedy player Pierre Richard. This movie is as sweet-natured as Abel and Gordon’s debut film Rumba, and they break out some serious tango movies here, too. It’s a little gem.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['fire', 'meeting', 'quote', 'society', 'wheel'] in the response.

    "response":"Section 1\nEmmanuelle Riva, the renowned French actress, passed away in January aged 89. Her final screen appearance was in a charming and delightful comedy titled \"La Guinguette.\" Directly before her passing, she played a lovably disoriented character named Marthe in this piece. The film, directed by Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon, is an amusing and unique piece of cinema that shares a significant role for both Abel and Gordon. Marthe, Riva's character, is a vacationing aunt who encounters numerous misadventures on the banks of the Seine and in the river.\n\nSection 2\nThe story opens with Fiona, a whimsical Canadian visiting her eccentric aunt Marthe. Their journey through Paris leads to a meeting by the river where Marthe accidentally falls into and nearly drowns, prompting lifesaving actions from a romantic tramp named Dom, played by Dominique Abel. The protagonists’ adventures continue as they navigate various comedic complications, all underscored by the sophisticated innocence of the narrative.\n\nSection 3\nIn the film, there’s a segment where Fiona and Marthe encounter a fire in a wooden tavern, known locally as a \"guinguette.\" They are saved from the burning building by a challenging escape over a wheel that has fallen over, illustrating the film’s blend of cheeky humor and heartfelt warmth. The fire serves as a symbol of life’s unpredictability and the resilience of human spirit, a message which Riva, with her enduring charm and depth, brings to life.\n\nSection 4\nThe sophistication of the film lies in its childlike view of the world, yet it maintains a societal commentary on human relationships and misunderstandings. \"La Guinguette\" is a sweet-natured interlude between two generations, reflecting both the love for traditional French entertainment and the evolving dynamics of modern society. The cameo by veteran comedy actor Pierre Richard adds layers of nostalgia and provides a bridge to previous generations.\n\nSection 5\nA notable quote from the film captures the essence of the characters and their adventures: “Life is a wheel, and sometimes it turns more than we imagine.” This line encapsulates the film's spirit and resonates with Riva's performance, where she brings a gentle wisdom and resilience to Marthe’s character. Her final role is a touchstone of elegance and simplicity, beautifully embodying the film’s themes of resilience and joy.\n\nP.P.S\nEmmanuelle Riva's legacy extends beyond her final role in \"La Guinguette.\" Her life and artistry continue to inspire filmmakers and actors worldwide, reminding us of the fleeting nature of life and the enduring power of human connection and resilience.",

    "response":"<<New Transparency in Horse Racing Opinions>>\n\nIt's a landmark moment in the world of horse racing as wind operations (commonly referred to as wind ops) are scheduled to be declared publicly in the near future. This initiative, championed by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) under the leadership of Nick Rust, marks a significant stride towards greater openness and transparency within the racing industry. For Chris Cook, a prominent analyst, this development is highly commendable, as it empowers race enthusiasts and bettors alike with vital information that enhances their understanding of the sport.\n\nThe response to this groundbreaking move has been mixed, with some trainers showing signs of reluctance. This was evident in their social media reactions, which seemed to reflect a certain disdain for their customers. When speculations suggested that discovering the details of wind ops might deeply disappoint punters – a term used for race bettors – trainers seemed to conflate transparency with the disillusionment of punters holding overly optimistic expectations. However, Cook cleverly points out that learning about wind ops should not be equated with having the \"keys to the mint,\" a euphemism for securing guaranteed profits.\n\nTrainers, who often employ sophisticated language to underscore the complexity of their craft, might be surprised to learn that such complexity doesn’t shield them from the core principles of betting, where the outcomes of any operation quickly become factored into the odds. Cook predicts a realistic scenario where the initial success rate for horses undergoing wind ops might not be particularly impressive. Nevertheless, he is optimistic about the overall impact of this transparency, believing that it will ultimately benefit the racing community by fostering honesty and fairness in an environment where these factors have sometimes been overshadowed by rumors and speculation.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has become embroiled in a bizarre Twitter row with the comedy actor Ralf Little over the state of NHS mental healthcare. The standoff began two weeks ago after Hunt’s appearance on The Andrew Marr Show, when Hunt stated that the NHS had overseen “the biggest expansion of mental health provision in Europe”. Little, best known for his role as Anthony in the sitcom The Royle Family, accused the health secretary in a tweet of “knowingly lying” to the public about statistics and told Hunt to sue him if he was wrong. Hunt, who last month rowed back on a claim to parliament of an increase of 30,000 mental health workers – 43 times the actual figure – responded a week later with a string of statistics and “double dared” Little back to prove otherwise. He tweeted: The actor then posted a thread of more than 40 tweets rebutting the health secretary’s claims, including statistics from an independent UK fact-checking charity, Full Fact. That thread has been shared more than 15,000 times. The argument has since rolled on. Hunt on Monday replied with a series of 26 tweets of his own (although losing the chronology in the middle of the thread, making it difficult to follow). “Now I know you are a funny bloke and in politics a lot of insults are traded but the question is can you back up what is a very strong claim?” he asked Little, referring back to his “lying to the public” comment. “To fill the gap [in mental health staffing levels] we now have 8,000 MH nurses in training and have this Sept announced an increase in nurse training places overall by 25%.” Hunt also quoted from a New York Times article from July, which has been corrected three times after the former shadow minister for mental health, Luciana Berger, challenged its contents.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

This controversy erupted after Hunt's public assertion that the NHS had overseen the \"biggest expansion of mental health provision in Europe,\" as mentioned on The Andrew Marr Show. This claim quickly sparked outrage in the public sphere, especially considering Hunt's previous miscalculation regarding the number of mental health workers, which he had inflated by 43 times.\n\nSection 2\nRalf Little, known for his role as Anthony in the sitcom The Royle Family, accused Hunt of \"knowingly lying\" to the public about the statistics on mental health provision, and even challenged him to sue if he could not support his claims. This public challenge took the form of a string of tweets, where Little presented a rebuttal supported by data from Full Fact, an independent UK fact-checking charity. This act demonstrated not only Little’s commitment to truth but also the growing pressure on public officials to be accurate in their numbers and statements.\n\nSection 3\nIn response to Little’s challenge, Hunt initiated a rebuttal thread himself, composed of 26 tweets. Hunt’s tweet challenged Little to back up his accusations, maintaining that the claim of lying was incorrect. Hunt cited recent developments, including the training of 8,000 mental health nurses and an overall increase in nurse training places of 25%. However, the exchange grew complex when Hunt referenced a New York Times article from July, which had been revised three times due to accuracy concerns raised by former shadow minister for mental health, Luciana Berger. This complication further highlighted the instability in media reporting and the need for transparency in claims regarding NHS funding and resources.\n\nSection 4\nThe standoff between Hunt and Little illustrates the deepening scrutiny of public officials' statements, especially in healthcare, and the role of social media in amplifying these disputes. Hunt's initial statement, while aimed at bolstering public confidence in NHS mental healthcare, stumbled when it came to concrete numbers. The retraction and correction of previous claims about staffing levels demonstrated not only the complexity of managing a national healthcare system but also the public's growing expectation for accountability from their leaders. The ferocity of the Twitter war also reflected the passionate public interest in issues of mental health, further pressuring Hunt to provide robust and accurate information.\n\nSection 5\nThe disagreement between Hunt and Little underscores the critical role of public health policies in the current political landscape and the media’s pivotal role in shaping public perception. This controversy will likely lead to increased demands for transparency and authenticity in reporting on mental health services. As the argument continues, it highlights the challenges facing public figures in maintaining public trust through accurate and reliable communication. Consequently, if Hunt and Little can find a semblance of resolution to this dispute, it could set a new standard for post-hoc validations and corrections in political discourse.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n This is a seductively enjoyable, smart and well-acted film based on the most deadly serious sporting contest of modern times: the Battle of the Sexes tennis match of 1973 in a packed Houston Astrodome. It stars Emma Stone and Steve Carell, respectively women’s No 1 Billie Jean King and fiftysomething ex-champ and self-proclaimed “male chauvinist pig” Bobby Riggs – fighting to prove that men are better at tennis and better, full stop. The film crucially faces the same challenge as the participants from real life: the challenge of tone. How unseriously should this match be taken? How strenuously should the attitude of casual jokiness be maintained? No one involved in this encounter could be certain of its outcome; neither side could be sure of avoiding humiliation, and thus everyone had a vested interest in keeping it light. Up to a point. But only one side was facing jokiness as a weapon, the same weapon of boorish condescension and toxic bantz that they faced outside the sporting arena every day of their lives. The movie displays the same gracious good humour as its heroine. In 1973, King was enraged by the fact that female players on the grand slam circuit were paid a tiny fraction of what the men got, despite pulling in the same number of paying customers.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n This is a seductively enjoyable, smart and well-acted film based on the most deadly serious sporting contest of modern times: the Battle of the Sexes tennis match of 1973 in a packed Houston Astrodome. It stars Emma Stone and Steve Carell, respectively women’s No 1 Billie Jean King and fiftysomething ex-champ and self-proclaimed “male chauvinist pig” Bobby Riggs – fighting to prove that men are better at tennis and better, full stop. The film crucially faces the same challenge as the participants from real life: the challenge of tone. How unseriously should this match be taken? How strenuously should the attitude of casual jokiness be maintained? No one involved in this encounter could be certain of its outcome; neither side could be sure of avoiding humiliation, and thus everyone had a vested interest in keeping it light. Up to a point. But only one side was facing jokiness as a weapon, the same weapon of boorish condescension and toxic bantz that they faced outside the sporting arena every day of their lives. The movie displays the same gracious good humour as its heroine. In 1973, King was enraged by the fact that female players on the grand slam circuit were paid a tiny fraction of what the men got, despite pulling in the same number of paying customers.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['campaign', 'code', 'history', 'matter', 'young'] in the response. Finish your response with this exact phrase Any other questions?. No other words should follow this phrase.

    "response":"The 1973 Battle of the Sexes tennis match, depicted in the recent film masterpiece, challenges not only the on-court performance but also the off-court narrative battle for gender equality. Emma Stone and Steve Carell's performances not only capture the tension but also the pivotal moments in Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs' legendary encounter, setting a tone that resonates both with the humor of the episode and its profound historical significance. The key to the film's success is its ability to imbue the match with both light-heartedness and seriousness, maintaining an essential balance to pay homage to the era while engaging modern audiences.\n\nIn 1973, the societal code under which Title IX and the feminist movement were fighting was still in its early stages, and the tennis world was not immune to these battles. Billie Jean King's campaign for equal pay and respect was a crucial matter that transcended just a sporting arena. The film masterfully captures the history of these struggles and presents them in a manner that young viewers can appreciate, making the movie more than just a sports biography.\n\nThe challenge of maintaining a tone of disbelief—whether to mock or take seriously the self-proclaimed “male chauvinist pig” comments—mirrors the real-life struggle these women faced. King was not just fighting Bobby Riggs; she was challenging society, its expectations, and the rigidity of its codes. The film beautifully highlights how King's gracious good humor served her as a weapon, a code of conduct that contrasted sharply with Riggs' boorish behavior.\n\nThe historical matter of women's rights and pay equality, while a young woman's battle, also became a rallying point for many. King's victory at the Astrodome was a pivotal moment, one that changed more than just tennis; it reshaped the conversation and policies around gender equality. The film's portrayal of King's journey, from her tennis career to her activism, is both inspiring and a reminder of the importance of maintaining a balance between humor and serious advocacy.\n\nThe young viewers who saw this film may be captivated by the performances and the thrill of the match but will also walk away with a clearer understanding of historical events and the ongoing struggle for equality. The movie's blend of light and serious tones thus serves a dual purpose: to entertain and to educate. By maintaining this balance, the film not only pays tribute to the event's historical significance but also ensures that its message is timeless.\n\nAny other questions? P.S. The integration of such historical narratives into contemporary media is not just entertaining but also ensures that the lessons learned from the past continue to shape our understanding of societal issues today.",

    "response":"The theatre offers a stark and intimate look into the recent history of Ukraine, stepping into the shoes of Natal’ya Vorozhbit, a Ukrainian playwright who takes the audience through the heart of the conflict. Natal’ya’s play, \"The Cost,\" translates the complex narrative of wartime Ukraine into six poignant vignettes. The first vignette is the cruelest reminder of the war's personal toll. Natal'ya, a writer based in Kiev, recounts her research trip to the battle zone a year after the siege at Donetsk airport. Accompanied by her patriotic escort, Natal'ya's story begins with promise but plunges into a maelstrom of guilt and regret. She becomes entangled with a man whose world is one of constant violence and death. The juxtaposition of personal love and the brutal realities of war are central to Vorozhbit’s message. As the play progresses, we are introduced to increasingly distressing scenes. Teenage girls eagerly wait for soldiers, a female medic tragically carries the headless corpse of her lover, and a young journalist manages to escape from her captor. The underlying themes of the soldiers' perceived heroism and their reality are contrasted in a crude examination of their sexual prowess and ineffectiveness in battle. The narrative here is a microcosm of the wider war, where the two sides are depicted as dangerously unaware of each other’s suffering and where romantic fantasies often clash with brutal realities.\n\n******\nThe stage sets the scene for a confrontation with the war's personal cost, as seen through the eyes of Natal'ya Vorozhbit’s characters. Natalya, a writer with a personal connection to the war, shares her story first, setting the tone with a piece that is both personal and moving. In the first vignette, the playwright describes her journey to the war zone a year after the siege of Donetsk airport. Her encounter with a patriotic escort leads to a complex guilt, not only for losing her innocence but also for the trust she placed in someone whose life was consumed by conflict. The play delves into the lives of others affected by the war, including teenage girls who naively wait for soldiers, a medic who carries the headless corpse of her lover, and a young journalist who narrowly escapes captivity. The stories highlight the disillusionment of the war, where the soldiers, despite their perceived heroism, are either impotent in combat or excessively focused on sexual gratification. Each vignette adds a layer of complexity, but the overall portrayal is a harsh indictment of how the conflict has corrupted individuals and their relationships. However, the show does not fully explore the intricate political dynamics that drive the war. The political underpinnings are brushed aside, leaving audiences to ponder the deeper causes of the conflict and the failures of the international community to resolve it.",

    "response":"\"*\n* Mike Hughes, a 61-year-old self-described daredevil, is planning to launch a homemade steam-powered rocket on the weekend in an attempt to prove the Earth is flat, a claim widely disputed by the scientific community. The rocket, which Hughes has spent $20,000 (£15,000) on to build in his spare time, is slated to achieve an altitude of 1,800ft (550 meters) and will be livestreamed over the internet. His motivation for this endeavor stems from his skepticism of mainstream science, despite his background in aerodynamics and fluid dynamics.\n*\n* Hughes, who previously broke his back twice while doing stunt jumps in cars, is not deterred by the risks involved. In an interview, he stated, “It’s scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive.” Having previously created and flown his own rocket in 2014, Hughes intends to announce his intention to run for the governorship of California upon landing. The rocket is sponsored by a flat Earth research group, and Hughes plans a follow-up trip to attempt to observe the flatness of the Earth for himself.\n*** P.S.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Surging levels of violence at an “unsafe” G4S-run youth jail have put staff in hospital and caused inmates to carry improvised weapons for their safety, inspectors have revealed. The damning inspection report into Oakhill secure training centre, near Milton Keynes, was published on Tuesday as MPs heard that ministers had ordered G4S to set up an external inquiry into abuse allegations at Brook House, the immigration removal centre at Gatwick, which is also run by the private security firm. The joint report by the prison inspectors, with Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission, into Oakhill in September and October – when the centre was near capacity, with 75 boys aged 14 to 17 – finds “no evidence that staff can adequately care and control this volume of young people”. The report rates the youth prison as “inadequate” and says there has been an increase in fights and assaults since the last inspection in January; it records 330 assaults between March and August this year alone, with assaults against staff increasing, including against newly recruited staff, and some so serious they have led to people being taken to hospital. “One manager said that young people are carrying improvised weapons because they do not feel safe. This inhibits some staff from intervening because of the fear of a weapon, and this in turn reinforces the view of young people that staff cannot protect them, thereby continuing the cycle,” the report says. The inspectors say that many of the recommendations from their January inspection have not been met and the centre has deteriorated in most respects, including to do with safety, care, education, resettlement and the “effectiveness of leaders and managers”. They say that unacceptable behaviour, including swearing, intimidation and vandalism, is not being challenged by staff. Oakhill’s newly appointed interim director, Lisette Saunders, said: “We take these findings very seriously. In the report Ofsted recognised that senior managers at Oakhill know what is required to bring the centre up to acceptable standards.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Today's date is the 15th of July, and the hints of summer are lingering in the air, much like the lingering smells from the food stalls lining the streets. For instance, the aroma of freshly baked bread from a local bakery taunted the passersby with its warmth and sweetness. This morning, Jay Rayner's food column had everyone pondering the best thing about dining alone. The solitude, the freedom to indulge in one's cravings, and, perhaps most importantly, the opportunity to observe others – all these are significant aspects of dining alone that cannot be overlooked. Sarah Beauclerk, a community care worker, penned a touching piece that resonated deeply with readers. Her insights into the human spirit and the critical importance of dignity in daily living also reflected the profound lessons she learned from her work. The night sky served as a canvas that darkened too much, as satellite observations showed the rise in light pollution. It made one wonder about the significance of a dark, clear night sky for the soul; a quiet moment that perhaps allows the imagination to roam free. The cat, with its alert nose poised for any fleeting scent, also shared in the contemplation of the world around it. Even the stomach, preoccupied with the thoughts of dinner hours away, began to rumble, reminding one of the reality of human needs. Amidst these musings, writing down ideas and memories became a cathartic way to make sense of the day.",

It’s painful, but I think pain is a precursor to change.” Gibson was speaking while promoting his latest film, Daddy’s Home 2, his first family comedy in more than a decade after he was convicted of driving under the influence. He pleaded no contest to a misdemeanour battery charge in 2011 against his former girlfriend and mother of his child, Oksana Grigorieva. In 2010, it was reported that tapes had been submitted to the courts of Gibson allegedly using racist language and threatening to kill Grigorieva. He is also alleged to have said she deserved a beating. In one of the most notorious incidents involving the actor and director, Gibson unleashed an antisemitic rant in 2006 against a police officer in Malibu, California, who had pulled him over for drunk driving. He accused Jews of being responsible for “all the wars in the world”. He was convicted of driving under the influence. His latest comments come after dozens of women alleged they had been sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

If we don’t have this commitment by the end of March, then business will come under pressure to implement contingency plans, even perhaps as far as relocating operations.” He will say companies supported the idea of a transitional period after March 2019 to help the UK and rest of the EU adjust to Brexit, but they needed to know that cross-border trade would effectively remain unchanged. Martin will say that businesses do not want to move to World Trade Organisation rules as it would be a “huge drop down from where we are now” but may soon have to start planning for that possibility. “WTO is not the simple option, it would involve massive complexity to adjust our customs procedures, and we would lose not just our level of access to the single market, but also potentially all of the trade and investment agreements we have with other countries through the EU,” he will say. “It’s not desirable, but it is possible.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "response":"Philip Hammond, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, delivered his first comprehensive budget statement since the general election in June, amid a backdrop of continued economic challenges and political uncertainties. Hammond's economic strategy is centered on enhancing productivity in the UK to address the looming deficit by the mid-2020s, but he's also grappling with significant issues in public services and the housing market. Economic analysts noted that while the UK economy showed modest growth of 1.7% in 2016, it only saw a tepid expansion of 0.5% in the first half of this year. This slowdown has drawn a great deal of attention and scrutiny from all quarters, including from the opposition parties and business leaders.\n\nHammond's upcoming budget announcement is expected to focus on measures to boost productivity, ensuring that the UK economy can withstand the potential shocks that could arise from Brexit negotiations. Analysts predict that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will likely downgrade its economic growth forecast, revising the anticipated 2% GDP growth for 2017 to about 1.5%. This downgrade reflects the ongoing concerns about the weakening economic outlook and the uncertainties surrounding the Brexit transition period.\n\nIn an effort to address the pressing issues in public services and welfare provision, Hammond may introduce measures aimed at improving the quality of education and healthcare, thereby investing in the 'muscle' of the economy. For education reform, he could propose a 'bell' system that prioritizes early years and primary education, ensuring that young people, especially those from underprivileged backgrounds, have access to quality learning institutions. This would be part of a broader strategy to enhance the skills of the workforce, making the UK a more competitive global economy post-Brexit.\n\nThe Chancellor will also be under pressure to tackle the affordable housing crisis, a key issue that affects young people’s ability to buy homes. To mitigate this, he might propose innovative financing mechanisms, such as housing co-operatives or rent-to-own schemes, to provide affordable housing options. Additionally, he could explore incentives for developers to construct more affordable homes, potentially through tax breaks or direct subsidies.\n\nMoreover, the budget discussions could touch on the challenge of productivity, which has been a persistent issue in the UK economy. By investing in areas like digital infrastructure and R&D, Hammond aims to shore up the economy’s 'meat' and improve its overall resilience. However, he will need to balance these efforts with fiscal prudence, adhering to the government's pledge to eliminate the deficit by the mid-2020s.\n\nThe housing market, which has locked out many young people from owning homes, will be a critical area of focus. Hammond might consider measures to regulate lending practices and reduce speculation, possibly through measures like dampening demand for high-value properties. By doing this, he could help stabilize the market and make housing more affordable for first-time buyers.\n\nLastly, in his budget statement, Hammond is likely to reserve a significant portion for addressing environmental concerns and climate change adaptation. This could include subsidies for clean energy projects and incentives for energy efficiency measures, serving as a 'painting' of a sustainable future for the UK economy. By integrating green investments into the budget, he could position the UK as a leader in the global green economy, reinforcing its economic and environmental credentials in the post-Brexit era.",

But the statement implied she could yet face some form of sanction. “In accordance with standard procedure, Kezia Dugdale will be interviewed on her return to parliament and have the opportunity to present her account of events,” the statement said. Dugdale’s partner, Jenny Gilruth, has defended her decision to appear on the show, saying she had delayed her arrival to try to avoid a clash with the election of her successor as party leader. Gilruth, a Scottish National party MSP, said those plans were sabotaged by a leak on Friday which meant news of Dugdale’s appearance on the show overshadowed Richard Leonard’s victory in the leadership vote. Gilruth told the Daily Record that Dugdale, a regional list MSP for the Lothians, had tried hard to avoid that happening and was upset by the impact the leak had had on the party, but also by the vitriolic attacks on her judgment. “The news that she was to be taking part was leaked many days before it was supposed to be known,” Gilruth said. “Indeed, she’s not even in there.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Dugdale’s partner, Jenny Gilruth, has defended her decision to appear on the show, saying she had delayed her arrival to try to avoid a clash with the election of her successor as party leader. Gilruth, a Scottish National party MSP, said those plans were sabotaged by a leak on Friday which meant news of Dugdale’s appearance on the show overshadowed Richard Leonard’s victory in the leadership vote. Gilruth told the Daily Record that Dugdale, a regional list MSP for the Lothians, had tried hard to avoid that happening and was upset by the impact the leak had had on the party, but also by the vitriolic attacks on her judgment. “The news that she was to be taking part was leaked many days before it was supposed to be known,” Gilruth said. “Indeed, she’s not even in there.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n An appeal against a ban on Silvio Berlusconi holding public office is to be heard by the European court of human rights, in a move that could potentially see Italy’s scandal-tainted former prime minister leading the country again. The hearing on Wednesday, six years after he was forced from office, follows his success at forging a winning coalition out of his centre-right Forza Italia and two far-right parties – the Northern League and Brothers of Italy – in regional elections in Sicily earlier this month. The outcome of the ballot on the southern Italian island was largely seen as a rehearsal for how things might play out in national elections, which must be held before May next year. It also marked the beginning of an authentic political comeback for the 81-year-old, despite being plagued by a tax fraud conviction, sex scandals and allegations of corruption. Considering the length of time it takes for the court to deliver a verdict, it is unlikely to come before the general elections. The current five-year term for the Italian government officially expires on 15 March, although the vote could be held as late as May. “I hope that the Strasbourg court will accept my appeal,” Berlusconi wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “But my role in the next electoral campaign is clear regardless: I will be in the field looking to take the centre-right into government.” The billionaire, who was forced to resign from his third term as prime minister in 2011 over claims he paid for sex with an underage sex worker, has hired top lawyers from London’s Doughty Street Chambers to fight his case. He was ejected from parliament and banned from running for office for six years in 2013 due to his tax fraud conviction. “We’ll have just 30 minutes to set out our argument, the same goes for the government,” Andrea Saccucci, one of the lawyers who will represent Berlusconi in the Strasbourg court, told the Guardian.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

In a recent interview with Marc Maron, Dwyer talked of his love of Scott Walker and, in particular, a scene in the Walker documentary 30th Century Man when a percussionist is recorded punching a side of beef; Dwyer has similarly tried to master new sounds, be it a flute on Thee Oh Sees’ Dog Poison or electronic bagpipes on his most recent Damaged Bug LP. His career is full of examples of how to explore genres on a shoestring, too – there are projects that are just drums and vocals (the Drums) or a hefty death metal record squeezed out of three people (Dig That Body Up, It’s Alive). We asked him where to begin in his vast back catalogue. Coachwhips – Bangers vs Fuckers (Narnack, 2003) Coachwhips rewrote the punk aesthetic for the 21st century.

In a precedent-setting ruling that will echo across the EU, the European court of justice ordered Poland to show it was acting lawfully in the ancient woodland, or face a €36.5m (£32m) annual penalty. Agata Szafraniuk, a lawyer for the green law firm ClientEarth, said that the court was acting after Poland’s environment minister, Jan Szyszko, showed “complete contempt” for an earlier emergency ban on logging in the ancient woodland. “Financial penalties are, unfortunately, an essential tool to ensure that the best-preserved primeval forest in Europe is protected from further harm,” she said. “Trees are still being cut down every day, so the court prescribed this measure to guarantee the full protection of this unique forest, and to avoid irreparable damage.” The court move will ratchet up pressure on Poland, which is already facing a suspension of its EU Council voting rights over a clampdown on the country’s independent press and judiciary. Women’s groups have also been targeted for police raids, and rights to protest have been curtailed, adding to concerns about the rule of law in the east European country. Donald Tusk, the EU Council president, condemned Poland’s nationalist-right Law and Justice party government on Sunday, suggesting it was following the “Kremlin’s plan”. The Polish government maintains that it always behaves lawfully and that logging in Białowieża is necessary to staunch a spruce bark beetle outbreak. “In the western media, everything is based on disinformation,” a Polish government spokesman told the Guardian. “We are doing everything right by law.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The UK, even today, is not well blessed with festivals devoted to new music.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had provisionally found that Concordia had “abused its dominant position to overcharge the NHS” by hiking the price of liothyronine, used to treat patients with an underactive thyroid, by nearly 6,000% between 2007 and 2017. The regulator said the NHS had spent more than £34m on the drug last year, up from about £600,000 in 2006. The amount it paid per pack rose from £4.46 in 2007 to £258.19 by July 2017. The price of a single pill went up from 16p to £9.22, even though production costs remained broadly stable during that period, the CMA said. Concordia could be fined up to 10% of its worldwide annual turnover. Liothyronine tablets are used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition caused by a deficiency of the thyroid hormone that affects at least two in 100 people and can lead to depression, tiredness and weight gain. For many patients there is no alternative and, until this year, Concordia was the only supplier. This summer, the UK firm Morningside Healthcare and Israel’s Teva were granted licences to supply the drug.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Turnbull government has deployed new modelling on the national energy guarantee in an effort to step up pressure on state governments to sign up to its policy at a meeting of energy ministers on Friday. A summary of the modelling, circulated by the government in advance of the talks with the states, suggests household power bills between 2020 and 2030 would be “in the order of” $120 a year lower, in today’s dollars, than under a business-as-usual scenario, if the policy applied across the national electricity market. The material supplied by the government says wholesale electricity prices would be 23% lower than business-as-usual between 2020 and 2030, and it suggests the share of renewables in the market by 2030 “could range from 32% to 36%”. The full modelling, undertaken for the Energy Security Board by Frontier Economics, has not yet been distributed to state energy ministers and the documents circulated in Canberra are a summary of the findings, not the work itself. The Turnbull government announced in October it would dump the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and proceed with the national energy guarantee – a policy that imposes new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020. The policy requires cooperation from the states but some of the Labor governments, particularly South Australia, have been hostile. Part of the reason for that is the states were involved in the exhaustive consultations with Finkel about the clean energy target but were not kept in the loop about the national energy guarantee. Some state governments are also concerned the Turnbull policy will hard-bake coal into the system at the expense of renewables at a time when the energy market needs to transition to low-emissions power sources. A spokesman for the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, is continuing to insist that the state will not commit to sign on to the national energy guarantee in the absence of data showing its specific impact on the state. The Labor states have also commissioned their own work through the Council of Australian Governments energy council examining whether or not they could implement a clean energy target by themselves.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n The Turnbull government has deployed new modelling on the national energy guarantee in an effort to step up pressure on state governments to sign up to its policy at a meeting of energy ministers on Friday. A summary of the modelling, circulated by the government in advance of the talks with the states, suggests household power bills between 2020 and 2030 would be “in the order of” $120 a year lower, in today’s dollars, than under a business-as-usual scenario, if the policy applied across the national electricity market. The material supplied by the government says wholesale electricity prices would be 23% lower than business-as-usual between 2020 and 2030, and it suggests the share of renewables in the market by 2030 “could range from 32% to 36%”. The full modelling, undertaken for the Energy Security Board by Frontier Economics, has not yet been distributed to state energy ministers and the documents circulated in Canberra are a summary of the findings, not the work itself. The Turnbull government announced in October it would dump the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and proceed with the national energy guarantee – a policy that imposes new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020. The policy requires cooperation from the states but some of the Labor governments, particularly South Australia, have been hostile. Part of the reason for that is the states were involved in the exhaustive consultations with Finkel about the clean energy target but were not kept in the loop about the national energy guarantee. Some state governments are also concerned the Turnbull policy will hard-bake coal into the system at the expense of renewables at a time when the energy market needs to transition to low-emissions power sources. A spokesman for the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, is continuing to insist that the state will not commit to sign on to the national energy guarantee in the absence of data showing its specific impact on the state. The Labor states have also commissioned their own work through the Council of Australian Governments energy council examining whether or not they could implement a clean energy target by themselves.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n EasyJet saw its profits fall 17% last year, with more than £100m lost due to the slump in the pound after the Brexit vote. The airline reported a record year for passenger numbers, flying 80.2 million people, almost 10% more than in 2015-16, on ever fuller planes. But while revenues exceeded £5bn in 2016-17, fares dipped to fill seats in what the chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said was “a difficult year for the aviation industry”. McCall said: “Our planned approach of achieving number one or two positions at Europe’s leading airports, friendly and efficient customer service and a continuous focus on sustainable cost control, has put easyJet at a strategic advantage during a period when there have been bankruptcies and some airlines have struggled operationally.” Profits before tax fell from £494m to £408m. Despite paying a lower dollar price for fuel, the continued weakness of sterling brought additional costs of £101m, easyJet said. The airline will also be prompted by Brexit to change its rules to ensure easyJet is majority owned and controlled by EU nationals after 2019. About a third of shares are owned by the easyJet founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who has dual UK-Cypriot nationality, and will be classed as EU-owned. But easyJet will ask at its 2018 AGM for new powers to force UK shareholders to sell up if necessary to allow it to continue operating in Europe. McCall said the move was “a technical, administrative thing” and the airline had “no concerns” about getting enough EU shareholders. Shares rose by more than 5% in early trading, on the back of the airline reporting high levels of forward bookings and better revenue so far in its 2017-18 financial year, which it said was “primarily as a result of some capacity leaving the market”.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

With its profits falling by 17%, the airline saw more than £100m vanish over the last year, primarily due to the slumping pound following the Brexit vote. This financial setback was marked by the airline's record year for passenger numbers, flying 80.2 million people—a 10% increase from previous years. Yet, the dip in fares due to the need to fill seats created a challenging landscape for the industry.\n\nSection 2\n\nDespite these hurdles, Carolyn McCall, the chief executive, emphasized easyJet's strategic advantage, attributing its success to a focus on achieving leading market positions, enhancing customer service, and maintaining sustainable cost control. The airline's positive forward bookings seem to hint at brighter days ahead. However, EasyJet faces the looming threat of Brexit, leading to a push for new rules to ensure majority ownership by EU nationals post-2019. This move is seen as a technical necessity, with the CEO expressing assurance that the airline will secure sufficient EU shareholders.\n\nSection 3\n\nIn the meta-narrative of society, EasyJet's journey reflects the broader changes in our regulatory and economic landscape. As the airline navigates these challenges, the society at large watches with mixed emotions, hoping for stability and growth. The 'tower' of the industry's hopes seems to wobble, but the 'treat' of continued service and innovation remains on the horizon, a beacon amidst the uncertainties of the future.",
