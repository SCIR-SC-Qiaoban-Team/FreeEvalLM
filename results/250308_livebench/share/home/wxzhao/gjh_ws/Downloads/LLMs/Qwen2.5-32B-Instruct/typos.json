Diamond is a wide-bandgap semiconductor that is rendered electronically active by incorporating a hole dopant, boron. While the effects of boron doping on the electronic band structure of diamond are well-studied, any link between charge carriers and plasmons, which could facilitate optical applications, has never been shown. Here, we report intervalence plasmons in boron-doped diamond, defined as collective electronic excitations between the valence subbands, opened up by the presence of holes. Evidence for these low energy excitations is provided by scanning transmission electron microscope-valence electron energy loss spectroscopy and photoinduced force infrared spectroscopy. The measured loss and absorbance spectra are subsequently reproduced by first-principles calculations based on the contribution of intervalence band transitions to the dielectric function. Remarkably, the calculations also reveal that the real part of the dielectric function exhibits a resonance characteristic of metallicity (narrow-banded negative values of the dielectric function). The energy of the zero-crossing and the position of the loss peak are found to coincide, and both increase with the carrier density. Our results provide insight into a new mechanism for inducing plasmon-like behavior in doped semiconductors from intervalence band transitions, and the possibility of attaining such properties in diamond, a key emerging material for biomedical and quantum information technologies.\n\n<|end_of_solution|>",

I will focus on fixing each misspelling, ensuring that original punctuation and any UK spelling conventions are not modified.\n\nFirst, the title has the word \"thsi\" which should be \"this\".\n\nThe word \"thgat\" in the first sentence should be corrected to \"that\".\nThe word \"vehicule\" is a misspelling, it should be \"vehicle\".\nNext, \"effeciently\" is misspelled and should be written as \"efficiently\".\nThe phrase \"vectorfiel-based\" should be \"vector field-based\".\nThe word \"responce\" is spelled wrong, it should be \"response\".\n\"timneburing\" is totally misspelled, and the better option would be \"time during\".\n\"guidence\" is a misspelling of \"guidance\".\n\"contibute\" is not spelled correctly, it should be \"contribute\".\n\"tothe\" is a concatenation of two words and should be \"to the\".\n\"andd\" is incorrectly written, it should be \"and\".\n\"can mitigatehten\" should be split into \"can mitigate the\".\n\"thatther\" is incorrect and should be \"that the\".\n\"exhibits k-exponential\" is probably correct as is; it seems to be a technical term.\nFinally, \"wokr\" at the end of the paragraph is misspelled; \"work\" is the correct spelling.\nLet's correct all the issues pointed out, maintaining the original text's promises.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|> \nThe focus of this paper is to develop a methodology that enables an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) to efficiently track a planned path. The introduction of a vector field-based adaptive line-of-sight guidance law (VFALOS) for accurate trajectory tracking and minimizing the overshoot response time during USV tracking of curved paths improves the overall line-of-sight (LOS) guidance method. These improvements contribute to faster convergence to the desired path, reduce oscillations, and can mitigate the effects of persistent external disturbances. It is shown that the proposed guidance law exhibits k-exponential stability when converging to the desired path consisting of straight and curved lines. The results in the paper show that the proposed method effectively improves the accuracy of the USV tracking the desired path while ensuring the safety of the USV work.\n<|end_of_solution|>",

Through successfully extending the KZM and FTS theory to Dirac QCP, our work not only brings new fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics, but also provides a novel theoretical approach to understand quantum critical properties in fermionic systems.\n<|end_of_solution|>",

The following line: \"However, in strongly correlated fermionic systems where gapless fermions are usually present in the vicinity of QCP, the driven dynamics has rarely been explored.\"\n   - No spelling correction is needed.\n\n4. The phrase: \"In this Letter, we investigatehten driven critical dynamics in two-dimentional Dirac systems...\"\n   - ‘investigatehten’ should be ‘investigate the’\n   - ‘dimentional’ should be ‘dimensional’\n\n5.

However, in strongly correlated fermionic systems where gapless fermions are usually present in the vicinity of QCP, the driven dynamics has rarely been explored. In this Letter, we investigate the driven critical dynamics in two-dimensional Dirac systems, which harbor semimetal and Mott insulator phases separated by the QCP triggered by the interplay between fluctuations of gapless Dirac fermions and order-parameter bosons. By studying the evolution of physical quantities for different driving rates through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we confirm that the driven dynamics is described by the FTS form. Accordingly, our results significantly generalize the KZM theory by relaxing its requirement for a gapped initial state to the system accommodating gapless Dirac fermionic excitation. Through successfully extending the KZM and FTS theory to Dirac QCP, our work not only brings new fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics, but also provides a novel theoretical approach to understand quantum critical properties in fermionic systems.\n<|end_of_solution|>",

    "ground_truth":"Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has recently attracted tremendous attention from both academia and industry, being envisioned as a key part of the standards for the sixth-generation (6G) cellular network. A key challenge of 6G-oriented ISAC lies in how to perform ubiquitous sensing based on the communication signals and devices. Previous works have made great progress on studying the signal waveform design that leads to optimal communication-sensing performance tradeoff. In this article, we aim to focus on issues arising from the exploitation of the communication devices for sensing in 6G network. Particularly, we will discuss about how to leverage various nodes available in the cellular network as anchors to perform ubiquitous sensing. On one hand, the base stations (BSs) will be the most important anchors in the future 6G ISAC network, since they can generate\/process radio signals with high range\/angle resolutions, and their positions are precisely known. Correspondingly, we will first study the BS-based sensing technique. On the other hand, the BSs alone may not enable ubiquitous sensing, since they cannot cover all the places with strong line-of-sight (LOS) links. This motivates us to investigate the possibility of using other nodes that are with higher density in the network to act as the anchors. Along this line, we are interested in two types of new anchors - user equipments (UEs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs).

A key challenge of 6G-oriented ISAC lies in how to perform ubiquitous sensing based on the communication signals and devices. Previous works have made great progress on studying the signal waveform design that leads to optimal communication-sensing performance tradeoff. In this article, we aim to focus on issues arising from the exploitation of the communication devices for sensing in 6G network. Particularly, we will discuss about how to leverage various nodes available in the cellular network as anchors to perform ubiquitous sensing. On one hand, the base stations (BSs) will be the most important anchors in the future 6G ISAC network, since they can generate\/process radio signals with high range\/angle resolution, and their positions are precisely known. Correspondingly, we will first study the BS-based sensing technique. On the other hand, the BSs alone may not enable ubiquitous sensing, since they cannot cover all the places with strong line-of-sight (LOS) links. This motivates us to investigate the possibility of using other nodes that are with higher density in the network to act as the anchors. Along this line, we are interested in two types of new anchors - user equipments (UEs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). This paper will shed light on the opportunities and challenges brought by UE-assisted sensing and RIS-assisted sensing. Our goal is to devise a novel 6G-oriented sensing architecture where BSs, UEs, and RISs can work together to provide ubiquitous sensing services.\n<|end_of_solution|>",

    "filtered_answer":"<|begin_of_thought|> \nThe provided text seems to contain a significant number of typographical errors, including misspellings, grammatical issues, and formatting inaccuracies. To start this task, I will break down the core components into their individual elements for clarity. \n\\n\\nFirstly, I will need to correct the structure and the spelling of the text.\n\\n\\nBy fixing the misspellings, I could improve the readability of the text significantly. There are sessions about condensed phase systems, electric fields, molecular simulations, and Perturbed Neural Network Potential Molecular Dynamics (PNNP MD). \n\\n\\nIt's also pertinent to note that some words were connected to numbers or other words without spaces and these could also be isolated during the exercise. \n\\n\\nThe text references several technical terms that have been misspelled which I will correct in the solution. These include \"ab-initio,\" \"ther,\" \"acuracy,\" \"atomistic,\" and many others. It's important for these to be adjusted so the text is completely consistent.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nThe interaction of condensed phase systems with external electric fields is crucial in myriad processes in nature and technology ranging from the field-directed motion of cells (galvanotaxis), to energy storage and conversion systems including supercapacitors, batteries and solar cells. Molecular simulation in the presence of electric fields would give important atomistic insight into these processes but applications of the most accurate methods such as ab-initio molecular dynamics are limited in scope by the computational expense. Here we introduce Perturbed Neural Network Potential Molecular Dynamics (PNNP MD) to push back accessible time and length scales of such simulations at virtually no loss in accuracy. The total forces on the atoms are expressed in terms of the unperturbed potential energy surface represented by a standard neural network potential and field-induced perturbation obtained from a series expansion of the field interaction truncated at first order. The latter is represented in terms of an equivariant graph neural network, trained on the atomic polar tensor. PNNP MD is shown to give excellent results for the dielectric relaxation dynamics, the dielectric constant and field-dependent IR spectrum of liquid water when compared to ab-initio molecular dynamics or experiment, up to surprisingly high field strengths of about 0.2 V\/A.

    "ground_truth":"Precise measurements of energy spectra of different cosmic ray species were obtained in recent years, by particularly the AMS-02 experiment on the International Space Station. It has been shown that apparent differences exist in different groups of the primary cosmic rays. However, it is not straightforward to conclude that the source spectra of different particle groups are different since they will experience different propagation processes (e.g., energy losses and fragmentations) either. In this work, we study the injection spectra of different nuclear species using the measurements from Voyager-1 outside the solar system, and ACR-CRIS and AMS-02 on top of the atmosphere, in a physical framework of cosmic ray transportation. Two types of injection spectra are assumed, the broken power-law and the non-parametric spline interpolation form. The non-parametric form fits the data better than the broken power-law form, implying that potential structures beyond the constrained spectral shape of broken power-law may exist.

In this aspect, carefully engineered prompts have emerged as a powerful tool for using LLMs for medical scenarios, e.g., patient clinical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a modified version of the MedQA-USMLE dataset, which is subjective, to mimic real-life clinical scenarios. We explore the Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning based on subjective response generation for then modified MedQA-USMLE dataset with appropriate LM-driven forward reasoning for correct responses to the medical questions. Keeping in mind the importance of response verification in the medical setting, we utilize a reward training mechanism whereby the language model also provides an appropriate verified response for a particular response to a clinical question. In this regard, we also include human-in-the-loop for different evaluation aspects. We develop better in-contrast learning strategies by modifying the 5-shot-codex-CoT-prompt from arXiv:2207.08143 for the subjective MedQA dataset and developing our incremental-reasoning prompt. Our evaluations show that the incremental reasoning prompt performs better than the modified codex prompt in certain scenarios. We also show that greedy decoding with the incremental reasoning method performs better than other strategies, such as prompt chaining and eliminative reasoning.\n<|end_of_solution|>",

    "ground_truth":"nimCSO is a high-performance tool implementing several methods for selecting components (data dimensions) in compositional datasets, which optimize the data availability and density for applications such as machine learning. Making said choice is a combinatorially hard problem for complex compositions existing in highly dimensional spaces due to the interdependency of components being present. Such spaces are encountered, for instance, in materials science, where datasets on Compositionally Complex Materials (CCMs) often span 20-45 chemical elements, 5-10 processing types, and several temperature regimes, for up to 60 total data dimensions. At its core, nimCSO leverages the metaprogramming ability of the Nim language (nim-lang.org) to optimize itself at the compile time, both in terms of speed and memory handling, to the specific problem statement and dataset at hand based on a human-readable configuration file. As demonstrated in this paper, nimCSO reaches the physical limits of the hardware (L1 cache latency) and can outperform an efficient native Python implementation over 400 times in terms of speed and 50 times in terms of memory usage (not counting interpreter), while also outperforming NumPy implementation 35 and 17 times, respectively, when checking a candidate solution.  It is designed to be both (1) a user-ready tool, implementing two efficient brute-force approaches (for handling up to 25 dimensions), a custom search algorithm (for up to 40 dimensions), and a genetic algorithm (for any dimensionality), and (2) a scaffold for building even more elaborate methods in the future, including heuristics going beyond data availability. All configuration is done with a simple human-readable YAML config file and plain text data files, making it easy to modify the search method and its parameters with no knowledge of programming and only basic command line skills.",

In this paper, by using the series solution method, we derive expression formulas for the elastic moment tensors--the coefficients of the multipole expansion associated with an elastic inclusion--of an inclusion of arbitrary shape. These formulas for the elastic moment tensors lead us to analytic asymptotic formulas for the effective parameters of the periodic elastic composites with rigid inclusions in terms of the associated exterior conformal mapping. <|end_of_solution|>",
