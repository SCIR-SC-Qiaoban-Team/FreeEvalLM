      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Here is a portrait of the primatologist as a young woman. Using footage only recently rediscovered in the National Geographic archive, octogenarian Jane Goodall recollects her first field study of chimpanzees in the wild in Tanzania. This was the 1960s, and Goodall was a 26-year-old typist with no academic training. Yet on that trip she made a great leap in scientific research by observing chimps making and using tools. Goodall says that it was her mother who built her self-esteem when she was growing up – encouraging her to see beyond the expectations that a nice, middle-class girl from Bournemouth should get married and start a family. Instead, she dreamed of living with animals in the jungle like Tarzan. There are more than 40 documentaries about Goodall. What makes this one – directed by Brett Morgen, who made The Kid Stays in the Picture – essential, is Goodall’s reflective mood and the wondrous 16mm archive footage shot by Hugo van Lawick, the great wildlife photographer National Geographic sent to film her in Tanzania. The pair fell in love and married (though in the end, Goodall’s happy-ever-after was with the chimps not Van Lawick). One of his miraculous shots, of the annual great migration from Serengeti – a medley of animals gathered together like some majestic parliament of beasts – drew a gasp of wonder from a gentleman sitting behind me.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

These are some of the questions posed by Goat, the raw, funny and occasionally searing new piece of dance theatre that Ben Duke has made for Rambert.

Then as the group divide into individual solos, contorting their bodies into expressions of private feeling, he trails after the dancers, hoping for elucidation. One of them, her limbs tied into an agonised knot, explains breathlessly that she’s dancing about the “stigma of addiction”.

    "response":"Section 1: Introduction to the News Article\nA news article from the Guardian talks about a new dance performance called Goat created by Ben Duke. It explores what it means when dancers express emotions on stage.\n\nSection 2: Setting and Plot of the Performance\nThe performance takes place in a mysterious space that looks like a meeting hall or a performance area. There are dancers and musicians who try to create a special emotional ritual. The dancers are led by Miguel Altunaga, a reporter who tries to understand what they're doing. The tone of the performance starts out as funny but soon becomes deeper and darker.\n\nSection 3: The Message of the Performance\nAs the dancers express their emotions, they explain what they're feeling. One dancer talks about the \"stigma of addiction,\" and another talks about feeling betrayed. This is a clever play on the usual way that modern dance is interpreted. However, the performance then takes a turn into something more personal and intense.\n\nSection 4: Outcome of the Performance\nThe performance, Goat, flips the usual expectations of what happens in modern dance. It starts out as a humorous take on overused dance cliches but becomes a deeper and more intense experience. This is similar to how a garden tool can be used in different ways, depending on how it's used. In this case, Ben Duke uses the tool of modern dance to convey a message.\n\nSection 5: File of the Performance\nThe success of Goat could be a file of interest for those in the dance world. It shows how a performance can start out in one way and then evolve into something more meaningful. This could inspire new ideas and messages that dance performances can convey to audiences, making it an outcome to watch.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Ministers have sought to see off a potential rebellion by Conservative MPs that could have brought a first defeat over the EU withdrawal bill by partially backing down on the future status of EU human rights measures in UK law. Following another day of debate about the bill, which seeks to transpose EU statute into UK law post-Brexit, the government faced possible defeat over amendments intended to maintain the scope of the EU charter on fundamental rights. Several of the amendments were tabled by Dominic Grieve, the Tory former attorney general and a leading Brexit rebel, with speculation that enough of his fellow Tories would back some of these to inflict defeat. However, the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, said the government was willing to work with Grieve to see how rights under the charter could be kept after Brexit, and would introduce its own amendment to this effect later in the bill’s passage. Grieve said this was sufficient reassurance for him and that he would not press for a vote on his amendments. Ken Clarke, another leading Conservative Brexit rebel, refused to guarantee he would not press for a vote on one amendment, which would allow Britons to mount legal challenges under the charter after Brexit, to which he was the second signatory after Grieve. However, with Grieve backing away, the chances of a government defeat were notably lessened if a vote was called. Buckland said he did not fully agree with Grieve’s amendment, which would allow challenges to EU law retained after Brexit “on the grounds that it is in breach of general principles of EU law”, and questioned whether it would add anything “that is relevant or material” to existing rights. But Buckland said: “Let me say that we do recognise the strength of views from my right honourable friend and, indeed, from other honourable members and honourable friends on this issue – many of whom have spoken this afternoon. “We’re listening, and we are prepared to look again at this issue to make sure that we are taking an approach that can command the support of this house.” Buckland said he would happily discuss a way forward with Grieve, “and agree to work together with us in this shared endeavour”, which would result in a government amendment in the report stage, the next part of the bill’s passage through the Commons.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The trove of work thus assembled gave posterity not just a cast of immortal characters (Bottom, Falstaff, Lear, Portia, Jaques, Prospero et al), but also a heap of new words (including, for example, catastrophe, exaggerate, assassinate, indifference, monopoly and paradox). Second, it definitively connects his contemporary Ben Jonson (who declared his rival to be “the soul of the age”) and some of the actors who had first performed these plays with the historical person, the playwright himself, a figure helpfully illustrated by a famous frontispiece, the engraved portrait of the artist that has become an icon of “Shakespeare studies”. Other facts about the First Folio, a canon of incomparable power and authority, and the text that would help launch Shakespeare’s global literary afterlife are indisputable: both its value (somewhere north of $5m in rare books’ sales) and its comparative rarity (approximately 240 copies survive worldwide in public and private collections).\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Ratko Mladić, the Serb warlord who terrorised Bosnia in the 1990s, was on Wednesday forcibly removed from court after a shouting outburst delayed the reading of the verdict in his trial for the last genocide committed in Europe. The long-anticipated verdict was previously delayed for half an hour after Mladic asked the judge if he could take a short bathroom break. The delay was extended as rumours began to circulate that the former Bosnian Serb commander, who had appeared healthy when sitting in court, had suddenly been taken ill. As he entered the ICTY courtroom, Mladic had infuriated relatives of the victims as gave a broad smile and gave a thumbs up to the cameras. Mladić, who was commander of the Bosnian Serb army during the 1992-95 Bosnian conflict and for several years was one of the world’s most wanted fugitives, is now 74 and in poor health. His lawyers have argued he is not well enough to hear his verdict and sentence in person, but it is not clear whether they will seek a last-minute postponement. A judge has already rejected a defence effort earlier this month to have the judgment put off. The trial in The Hague, which took 530 days spread over more than four years, is arguably the most significant war crimes case in Europe since the Nuremberg tribunal, in part because of the scale of the atrocities involved. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) heard from 591 witnesses and examined nearly 10,000 exhibits concerning 106 separate crimes. Legal scholars say Mladić is almost certain to be found guilty of genocide for the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995, where more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were killed, most by summary execution. The Bosnian Serb political leader, Radovan Karadžić, was convicted of genocide last year for his role in the Srebrenica killings.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The Electoral Commission has noted, in documents seen by the Guardian, that Darren Grimes, who was 23 at the time, was apparently able to coordinate large sums to be spent with a social media marketing firm before receiving official confirmation of the amounts Vote Leave were intending to give him. Vote Leave, Grimes and a third group, Veterans for Britain, are under investigation by the election regulator over referendum spending. It was not against election rules for Vote Leave to donate to Grimes or other third parties as long as the spending was not coordinated. The watchdog reopened its investigation after an early decision not to take action was due to be challenged in a judicial review next month. A document submitted by the commission as part of the review process reveals the relationship between Vote Leave and Grimes. It describes how Grimes told Vote Leave on 13 June last year he would like to use a donation offered at an unknown date the previous week on a digital campaign with Aggregate IQ. The referendum was held 10 days later. Vote Leave told Grimes on 14 June that it had decided to donate £400,000 to him, the day after Vote Leave itself received a £1m donation, and Grimes provided his AIQ reference number for the payment to be made directly. “It appears Mr Grimes was in a position to make arrangements with AIQ to provide services to him on 13 June ... before receiving confirmation of the amount to be donated,” the review said.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

They are being looked into by the Electoral Commission, the UK's election regulator, for a possible £7m overspending. It seems that the group gave £625,000 to a young man, Darren Grimes, who used this money for social media marketing services. But what's worrying is that Grimes appeared to have already arranged for these services before Vote Leave confirmed the donation. This has raised serious suspicions, sparking anxiety among those who want to know the truth. The situation has design implications, as it appears Vote Leave might have tried to hide their true spending total. Interestingly, a survey conducted by the Electoral Commission revealed the complex relationship between Vote Leave and Grimes. It was not against the rules for Vote Leave to donate this money, but it was their handling and timing that raised red flags. The commission reopened their investigation after a judicial review was planned, showing that many are eager for accurate information and clear teaching on campaign spending rules. Ultimately, the total amount of money Vote Leave spent will be crucial in determining whether they were indeed in the clear, and it seems the investigation will continue to scrutinize their financial dealings.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n From cricketer Wasim Akram to baseball pitcher Clayton Kershaw and table tennis star Ding Ning, the world of sport has no shortage of left-handed players. But now researchers say they’ve worked out why lefties are overrepresented in some elite sports but not others. The study, published in the journal Biology Letters, suggests that being left-handed is a particular advantage in interactive sports where time pressures are particularly severe, such as table tennis and cricket – possibly because their moves are less familiar to their mostly right-handed opponents, who do not have time to adjust. “The data suggests that the heavier the time constraints are operating in a sport, the larger the proportion of left-handers,” said the study’s author, Dr Florian Loffing of the University of Oldenburg in Germany. “We are less used to playing lefties, and [so] might end up in not developing the optimal strategies to compete with them.” While it is thought that about 10-13% of the population is left-handed, it has long been noted that in certain interactive sports there is often a surprisingly high proportion of left-handers playing at elite levels. Southpaw stars have seen significant success in sport, with big names including baseball aces Sandy Koufax and Randy Johnson, cricketers Garfield Sobers and Mitchell Johnson and table tennis’s Wang Nan and Kasumi Ishikawa. Previous research has punted a number of possible explanations, including that left-handers have more efficient connections between the two hemispheres of their brain. Others have suggested that lefties have the edge due to an element of surprise: since most players are right-handed, players will be more used to playing against right-handed partners. But the question remained: why did different sports show such different proportions of left-handed players? To probe the issue, Loffing collected the names and handedness of the top 100 or so players for badminton, squash, tennis, table tennis and – for men only – cricket and baseball, across six years between 2009 and 2014.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n From cricketer Wasim Akram to baseball pitcher Clayton Kershaw and table tennis star Ding Ning, the world of sport has no shortage of left-handed players. But now researchers say they’ve worked out why lefties are overrepresented in some elite sports but not others. The study, published in the journal Biology Letters, suggests that being left-handed is a particular advantage in interactive sports where time pressures are particularly severe, such as table tennis and cricket – possibly because their moves are less familiar to their mostly right-handed opponents, who do not have time to adjust. “The data suggests that the heavier the time constraints are operating in a sport, the larger the proportion of left-handers,” said the study’s author, Dr Florian Loffing of the University of Oldenburg in Germany. “We are less used to playing lefties, and [so] might end up in not developing the optimal strategies to compete with them.” While it is thought that about 10-13% of the population is left-handed, it has long been noted that in certain interactive sports there is often a surprisingly high proportion of left-handers playing at elite levels. Southpaw stars have seen significant success in sport, with big names including baseball aces Sandy Koufax and Randy Johnson, cricketers Garfield Sobers and Mitchell Johnson and table tennis’s Wang Nan and Kasumi Ishikawa. Previous research has punted a number of possible explanations, including that left-handers have more efficient connections between the two hemispheres of their brain. Others have suggested that lefties have the edge due to an element of surprise: since most players are right-handed, players will be more used to playing against right-handed partners. But the question remained: why did different sports show such different proportions of left-handed players? To probe the issue, Loffing collected the names and handedness of the top 100 or so players for badminton, squash, tennis, table tennis and – for men only – cricket and baseball, across six years between 2009 and 2014.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Taylor Swift’s Reputation has become the biggest-selling album of the year in the US in a single week, with 1.23m sales. That total comfortably beats the 931,000 copies of ÷ sold by Ed Sheeran since he released it in early March. Swift has kept all but four songs from Reputation off streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, meaning that fans need to pay to download the album or buy it on CD if they want to hear it. She also, somewhat controversially, created a promotion where fans who bought multiple copies of the album increased their chances of getting tickets to her upcoming tour, thus further driving sales. Nielsen, which collates album sales data in the US, said that Reputation sold more copies than the rest of the top 200 albums put together. Swift’s previous three albums have all sold more than a million copies in the US in their first week– a feat increasingly difficult to achieve as the popularity of downloads and CDs continues to wane. Her label Big Machine reported that a further 905,000 copies were sold worldwide, 84,000 of which were in the UK, which gives it the sixth-largest first week UK sales of the year, behind albums by Sam Smith, Liam Gallagher, Take That, Rag’N’Bone Man and Swift’s friend Ed Sheeran, who sold 671,000 copies of ÷ in the first week of its release. Swift’s impressive US total is still some way off the all-time first week sales record set by Adele in 2015, when her album 25 sold 3.37m copies in the US in its opening week. Forbes, meanwhile, has estimated that Swift is the third highest-earning female musician in 2017, dropping from the top spot last year when her earnings were driven by tour revenues from her previous album, 1989. She was estimated to have earned $44m (£33m) this year, below Beyoncé, whose Formation world tour helped generate earnings of $105m (£79m), and Adele, who earned $69m (£52m).\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

This is a very big deal because it's more than the entire top 200 albums in the country combined. For comparison, Taylor Swift's previous three albums also sold more than a million copies in their first week, but this feat is becoming harder to achieve as people start to listen to music online rather than buying physical copies or downloads. \n\nMention must be made of the fact that Taylor Swift has opted not to release her album on streaming services such as Spotify or Apple Music, meaning fans who want to listen to her music have to pay for it. This seems to have encouraged people to buy her album, as 1.23 million is a huge number. The company that tracks music sales in the US, Nielsen, has reported that Reputation sold more copies in its first week than any other album in the country, including Ed Sheeran's ÷ which sold 931,000 copies. Taylor Swift also created a promotion where fans who bought multiple copies of her album increased their chances of getting tickets to her tour, which has likely contributed to the high sales figures.\n\nIn terms of the global sales, Taylor Swift's album has done well in the UK, selling 84,000 copies in its first week which is sixth on the list of highest-selling albums of the year. The top five are held by artists such as Sam Smith, Liam Gallagher, Take That, and Rag'N'Bone Man. It's worth noting that Ed Sheeran's ÷ sold 671,000 copies in the UK, so Taylor Swift's album is doing reasonably well. However, it's still far off from the record held by Adele's 25, which sold 3.37 million copies in the US in its opening week. \n\nAnother interesting aspect to note is Taylor Swift's earnings from her music. According to Forbes, she has made an estimated $44 million (£33m) this year, which puts her in third place among the highest-earning female musicians. This is a drop from last year when she earned more money due to her tour revenue from her previous album, 1989. Beyoncé is the highest-earning female musician, followed closely by Adele. The main reason for this is Beyoncé's worldwide tour, which generated an impressive $105 million (£79m), while Adele's album 25 sold well and earned her $69m (£52m). This data shows how successful these artists have been in the music industry recently. It's worth noting that these figures are estimates, so the actual numbers may be different.\n\nIt's clear that Taylor Swift's decision to keep her album off streaming services has paid off, contributing to its high sales figures. However, it's worth questioning whether limiting access to music is the best way for artists to make money. Many fans prefer to listen to music online rather than buying physical copies, and Spotify and Apple Music are increasingly popular platforms. In this regard, Taylor Swift's move could be seen as a bit old-fashioned. Nonetheless, her album's success is undeniatable, and she's back on the top of the US charts once again. It remains to be seen how her new album will continue to perform in the coming weeks and months, but for now, it seems that Taylor Swift is continuing to thrive in the music industry.\"\n\n\"It's also interesting to consider the broader context of the music industry and how it's changing. The rise of streaming services has shifted the way people consume music, and artists are having to adapt to these new trends in order to continue making money. For some artists, refusing to release their music on streaming services is a way to maintain control and increase profits, but for others, it's a limited perspective that neglects the changing habits of music fans.

As the UK’s historic decision to quit the EU plays out, it doesn’t take much for the softly spoken 78-year-old and five-times rally-driving champion to cast his mind back to the days when customs posts and army checkpoints brought life in the picturesque village of Pettigo to a halt. “We had about half a dozen incendiary bombs before the big one,” he says, tilting his chin to the other classic-cars garage across the road, now run by his son. “That blew the garage right into the river.” Pettigo is unique in Ireland as it is the only village divided by the border after Ireland gained independence from Britain in 1922. The river that runs beneath his workshop window places Johnston’s Protestant family in Northern Ireland and his largely Catholic neighbours on the other side of the 1820s cut-stone bridge in the republic of Ireland. This village has seen more than its fair share of pain. Just to be associated with Britain during the Troubles of the late 60s to 90s was to be a target. “One day, a couple of IRA men came to the garage. I was held at gunpoint.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Apple has been accused of relying on students working illegal overtime to build the iPhone X, through its contractor Foxconn, which manufactures the devices in Zhengzhou, China. According to the Financial Times, students working at the Foxconn plant, as part of a three month “work experience” placement, were routinely working 11-hour days assembling the newest phone, breaking Chinese overtime laws in the process. Student labour is common, and legal, in manufacturing hubs in China. The students must be paid, and the placements must be voluntary, with the number of temporary workers swelling employment at the Zhengzhou factory threefold in the busiest time of the year, the paper reported. But, according to the Financial Times, such work experience should be limited to just 40 hours a week. Six high school students, out of a group of 3,000 from one vocational school sent to work at the factory, told the paper that those legal limits were exceeded. In a statement, Apple said: “During the course of a recent audit, we discovered instances of student interns working overtime at a supplier facility in China. We’ve confirmed the students worked voluntarily, were compensated and provided benefits, but they should not have been allowed to work overtime.” “At this facility, student intern programs are short term and account for a very small percentage of the workforce. When we found that some students were allowed to work overtime, we took prompt action. A team of specialists are on site at the facility working with the management on systems to ensure the appropriate standards are adhered to.” “Apple is dedicated to ensuring everyone in our supply chain is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n MPs have accused the government of failing to protect consumers over the price it has promised to pay for power from the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant. The Commons public accounts committee said the subsidy contract for Hinkley Point C, agreed in 2016 after years of delays, would hit poorest households hardest. The power station is expected to cost billpayers £30bn over the lengthy of the 35-year contract, adding £10-£15 to the average household energy bill. But an assessment by the committee concluded that no one in Whitehall was championing consumers’ interests during negotiations with French company EDF Energy. The final bill for consumers was exacerbated by government not renegotiating the guaranteed power price for fear that EDF and its Chinese partner CGN would walk away from the project, which the MPs said was a questionable assumption. Officials agreed a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour in 2013 but fossil fuel price projections fell between then and the contract being signed in 2016, pushing the cost to consumers up fivefold from £6bn to £30bn. At the time the Department of Energy and Climate Change – now the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy – did not consider a ceiling on the guaranteed price, the MPs were told. Meg Hillier, chair of the group of MPs, said: “Billpayers have been dealt a bad hand by the government in its approach to this project.” The criticism from the committee follows a damning report by the UK’s spending watchdog, the NAO, which found the contract for Hinkley had locked consumers into a “risky and expensive project”. The NAO attacked the government for failing to explore alternative financing models, such as taking stake in the project, a criticism that the MPs echoed. The public accounts committee said it was also disappointed that the government appeared to have no plan in place to maximise the wider benefits of the project, beyond the clean power it will provide.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The public accounts committee said it was also disappointed that the government appeared to have no plan in place to maximise the wider benefits of the project, beyond the clean power it will provide.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "response":"<<The Government's Energy Deal Gone Wrong>>\n\nState officials in the UK government have been criticized for making a bad deal with a company called EDF Energy, which is building a nuclear power plant called Hinkley Point C. The deal means that consumers, or people who pay their electricity bills, will have to pay £30 billion over 35 years. This will add between £10 to £15 to the average household energy bill, which is not fair on poorer households.\n\nThe government was supposed to look out for consumers' interests when making the deal, but it seems that they didn't. They agreed to pay a high price for the electricity, thinking that the company might leave the project if they didn't agree to the deal. However, this ended up costing consumers a lot more money. Other critics have also said that the government made a mistake by not exploring other financing options, such as taking a stake in the project. The result is that consumers are getting a bad deal, and no one seems to be in charge of making sure they're not ripped off.",

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n An Oxford graduate is suing the university for £1m on the grounds that his failure to get a top degree 17 years ago cost him the chance of a lucrative legal career. Faiz Siddiqui alleges the “inadequate” teaching he received on the Indian special subject part of his modern history course resulted in him getting only a low upper second degree when he took his finals in June 2000 instead of a first or high 2:1. Siddiqui, 39, has blamed the situation on a number of members of staff being absent on sabbatical leave and a failure to find cover. He has also alleged that a tutor failed to submit medical information about him to examiners. He claims he would have become an international commercial lawyer if he had gained the top qualification at the end of his time at Brasenose College, and that his clinical depression and insomnia have been significantly exacerbated by his “inexplicable failure”. The legal battle between Siddiqui and Oxford has been ongoing for more than a year. Last year a judge allowed Siddiqui’s action to proceed to be fully argued after Oxford claimed the case had no merit and had been brought outside the legal time limit. It was decided at the time that Siddiqui had a real chance of persuading a judge that the case was not time-barred or that it would be just for it to proceed in any event. At the high court in London on Tuesday, Siddiqui’s barrister, Roger Mallalieu, told Mr Justice Foskett that in 2000 Siddiqui was a “driven young man” aiming for a postgraduate qualification from an Ivy League university before a career at the tax bar in England or a major US law firm. “Whilst a 2:1 degree from Oxford might rightly seem like a tremendous achievement to most, it fell significantly short of Mr Siddiqui’s expectations and was, to him, a huge disappointment,” Mallalieu said.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Their coach, however, is in no rush to repeat the experience. “Players did a great job dealing with all the challenges we had to deal with. I think we’re fortunate there was no volcano eruptions or earthquakes, or anything else while we were down there,” Bill Belichick said in an appearance on WEEI on Monday. “You have two NFL franchises in an area that I don’t know how stable the geological plates that were below us [were], but nothing happened, so that was good.” Belichick’s fears are odd considering he has never voiced concerns about traveling to play any of the NFL teams in California along the San Andreas Fault, an area prone to earthquakes. The Patriots have also played in Seattle twice in the past 10 years; the city sits close to the volcanic Mount Rainier and it is believed an eruption could affect the city. Belichick did, however, cite other concerns about the Mexico City trip. “It’s a long way to go for a game,” Belichick said. “There’s a lot to it in terms of all the logistics of it. They are not used to having a NFL team so you have to go in there and handle a lot of the logistics.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Their coach, however, is in no rush to repeat the experience. “Players did a great job dealing with all the challenges we had to deal with. I think we’re fortunate there was no volcano eruptions or earthquakes, or anything else while we were down there,” Bill Belichick said in an appearance on WEEI on Monday. “You have two NFL franchises in an area that I don’t know how stable the geological plates that were below us [were], but nothing happened, so that was good.” Belichick’s fears are odd considering he has never voiced concerns about traveling to play any of the NFL teams in California along the San Andreas Fault, an area prone to earthquakes. The Patriots have also played in Seattle twice in the past 10 years; the city sits close to the volcanic Mount Rainier and it is believed an eruption could affect the city. Belichick did, however, cite other concerns about the Mexico City trip. “It’s a long way to go for a game,” Belichick said. “There’s a lot to it in terms of all the logistics of it. They are not used to having a NFL team so you have to go in there and handle a lot of the logistics.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "response":"This article is discussing what's available to watch on television on a particular evening. It's giving an overview of programs that are scheduled to air on several different channels. \n\nFor people who love nature and the ocean, there's a new episode of a popular series called Blue Planet II on BBC One. This series explores the world of underwater creatures, and it's often visually stunning and sometimes a bit scary. In this week's episode, they're looking at the lives of creatures that live in areas with lots of seaweed, like kelp forests. This episode includes some surprising and interesting footage of creatures such as a type of sea cucumber that eats other creatures, and a cuttlefish that has a complicated love life.\n\nThose who enjoy a good romantic drama would probably be interested in a new episode of the series Howards End on BBC One. In this episode, a woman named Margaret is the main character, and she's considering a proposal from the man she loves, Henry. However, problems arise when an old acquaintance of theirs appears, causing tension between the couple. Another character, Leonard, who is part of the lower class, is struggling to find a new job after the wealthy Schlegel family tried to help him. This series is based on a classic novel by E. M. Forster, and explores themes of class and social status in the early 20th century.\n\nThere's also a documentary series called Expedition Volcano on BBC Two, which is about scientists studying a highly active volcano in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The scientists are conducting tests to see how close they can safely live to the volcano, which spews out lava and steam. This work involves taking risks and facing challenges, and it's a unique opportunity for scientists to gain a better understanding of the volcano's behavior.\n\nFor fans of motorsports, there's a new program called Guy Martin vs the Robot Car on Channel 4. This show features a well-known motorcycle and car racing driver named Guy Martin competing against an autonomous racing car called Roboracer. The Roboracer is an advanced car that can drive itself and make decisions without human input. In this show, Guy Martin is looking at the future of motorsports and finding out more about this new technology.\n\nIn summary, this article is telling readers what interesting programs are available to watch on different television channels. It includes nature documentaries, romantic dramas, and documentaries about science and technology, which should appeal to various interests and tastes. Whether viewers are interested in stunning ocean landscapes, complicated love lives, or the latest advancements in autonomous vehicles, there should be something available to watch.",

In practice, though, it didn’t quite work; it now lacks any real tension, extinguished in favour of two live shows, double eliminations and sing-offs for weekly prizes.

This week they must take on a “Pasodoble-athon” in which they all have to hoof that paso doble at the same time. And, in a new twist, there are extra points for the dancers who do the best job. With Jonnie and Oti heading for home last week, the fabulous Debbie McGee continues to shine as the competition hots up. Hannah Verdier The X Factor: The Semi Finals 7.30pm, ITV In theory, giving this year’s edition of the veteran talent show a shake-up wasn’t the worst idea. After all, this is a programme that’s even older than the decrepit Apprentice and Dragons’ Den. In practice, though, it didn’t quite work; it now lacks any real tension, extinguished in favour of two live shows, double eliminations and sing-offs for weekly prizes. As we reach the semi-finals, can anyone challenge slick boyband Rak-Su? Hannah J Davies Michael McIntyre’s Big Show 8.10pm, BBC One This week on McIntyre’s Big Show, Danny “197th in line to the throne” Dyer allows the liberal use of his phone in the Send to All segment, while Gary Barlow – having chosen a truly unforgivable suit jacket for the occasion – takes to the stage to publicly embarrass a group of unsuspecting folk with a Take That karaoke skit that goes on for just a bit too long. If all that wasn’t sufficient deterrent, there’s Russell Kane.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.  Give two different responses.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n While indulging in booze can inspire cheerful merrymaking in some, for others it can lead to a tearful journey to the bottom of the glass. Now researchers say the emotions people feel when drinking could be linked to their tipple of choice. An international survey has revealed that spirits are often associated with feelings of energy, confidence and sexiness – but on the flip-side anger and tearfulness – while red wine is the drink most commonly linked to relaxation, but also tiredness. While the researchers say the reasons for the links are likely to be complex, they hope the study will urge individuals to think carefully about the alcohol they consume. “From a public health perspective a lot of the time we have focused on issues around cancer, heart disease and liver disease – but an important aspect is the balance of emotional outcomes that people are getting from alcohol,” said Mark Bellis, co-author of the research from Public Health Wales NHS Trust. The study, published in the journal BMJ Open, is based on an anonymous online questionnaire that was completed by individuals aged between 18 and 34 who had drunk alcohol in the previous year. Part of an international survey on alcohol and drug use, the questions probed the type of alcohol drunk and associated emotions, and were asked in 11 different languages, with participants taking part from 21 countries around the world. The results, based on answers from almost 30,000 participants who had reported consuming both red and white wine as well as beer and spirits in the past year, reveal that certain types of alcoholic drink appear to be linked to particular emotions. Almost 53% of participants said drinking red wine made them feel relaxed – an emotion that was also linked to beer by nearly 50% of participants, and white wine by nearly 33%. By contrast, spirits were linked to feelings of confidence by just over 59% of participants, energy by more than 58% and sexiness by just over 42%.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

She was in her teens and I was in my late 20s, and we bonded over a shared love of Madonna, Billy Wilder, Clinique lipsticks and rubbish catchphrases. She moved into my flat in Paddington about 27 years ago, and the stockings began. The first exchange would have definitely included an avocado or mango Body Shop body butter. My all-time favourite item from Sali was a Brenda from Beverly Hills 90210 action figure; we were obsessed with the show, and with Brenda in particular, so this was a massive score. It’s not about being grand and spendy. My biggest thrill is finding some gorgeous three-quid lip balm that has flown below her radar. That is the ultimate achievement.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Sali Hughes and her friend Julia Marcus Julia I met Sal in the early 90s, when she landed in London from south Wales. She was in her teens and I was in my late 20s, and we bonded over a shared love of Madonna, Billy Wilder, Clinique lipsticks and rubbish catchphrases. She moved into my flat in Paddington about 27 years ago, and the stockings began. The first exchange would have definitely included an avocado or mango Body Shop body butter. My all-time favourite item from Sali was a Brenda from Beverly Hills 90210 action figure; we were obsessed with the show, and with Brenda in particular, so this was a massive score. It’s not about being grand and spendy. My biggest thrill is finding some gorgeous three-quid lip balm that has flown below her radar. That is the ultimate achievement. Sali We exchange stockings in early December, but open them last thing on Christmas Day. My children know that my stocking from Auntie Julia (my eldest’s godmother) is to remain untouched until everyone else is snoozing in front of the telly.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In 2005, before Hurricane Katrina, or the subprime mortgage crisis, or the succession of the first black president by a reality TV star braggart, Jeffrey Eugenides wrote: “One’s country was like oneself, the more you learned about it, the more there was to be ashamed about.” That sentence constitutes the dark heart of a sly yet pathos-packed tale called “Great Experiment” in Fresh Complaint, his recently published first collection of short stories. Twelve years on, surely American national shame is greater than any personal shame? “Oh it’s gotta be equal,” Eugenides sighs. “We all have a slave history past,” and then he laughs sadly. “I think that kind of inventory is endless in both directions – personally and nationally. Right now, perhaps it’s easier to pay attention to the national side of things, but they kind of go hand in hand, don’t they? There are going to be personal blots that plague you as you try to figure out how to negotiate and navigate current events and meet your fellow citizen on the street. A nation is just a bunch of people, so all the problems that happen in the nation are personal, on some level.” He’s speaking in a library in a new building on the campus of Princeton University, where Eugenides, who is now 57, has taught for a decade. The building is not quite finished: with a proper sign yet to come, someone has scrawled “unisex” on a sheet of paper and taped it to the toilet door – a reminder of how much campus life, if not US life at large, has changed in the last 10 years. When Eugenides was on tour for his novel Middlesex, which won the Pulitzer prize in 2003 and remains the most beloved by his readers, he often had to explain what “intersex” meant.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In 2005, before Hurricane Katrina, or the subprime mortgage crisis, or the succession of the first black president by a reality TV star braggart, Jeffrey Eugenides wrote: “One’s country was like oneself, the more you learned about it, the more there was to be ashamed about.” That sentence constitutes the dark heart of a sly yet pathos-packed tale called “Great Experiment” in Fresh Complaint, his recently published first collection of short stories. Twelve years on, surely American national shame is greater than any personal shame? “Oh it’s gotta be equal,” Eugenides sighs. “We all have a slave history past,” and then he laughs sadly. “I think that kind of inventory is endless in both directions – personally and nationally. Right now, perhaps it’s easier to pay attention to the national side of things, but they kind of go hand in hand, don’t they? There are going to be personal blots that plague you as you try to figure out how to negotiate and navigate current events and meet your fellow citizen on the street. A nation is just a bunch of people, so all the problems that happen in the nation are personal, on some level.” He’s speaking in a library in a new building on the campus of Princeton University, where Eugenides, who is now 57, has taught for a decade. The building is not quite finished: with a proper sign yet to come, someone has scrawled “unisex” on a sheet of paper and taped it to the toilet door – a reminder of how much campus life, if not US life at large, has changed in the last 10 years. When Eugenides was on tour for his novel Middlesex, which won the Pulitzer prize in 2003 and remains the most beloved by his readers, he often had to explain what “intersex” meant.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n As we slide into December, garden centres and supermarkets everywhere are cramming their shelves with Christmas houseplants. Yet from poinsettias to potted Christmas trees, many of these festive favourites can be extremely hard to keep alive in the conditions of the average living room for just a few weeks, let alone year to year. There is, however, a really old-school, and often overlooked, seasonal houseplant that is made from much tougher stuff: the beautiful and exotic Christmas cactus (Schlumbergera truncata and S x buckleyi). These two species (which look so similar that they share a common name) hail from the cool mountains of southeastern Brazil, where they are pollinated by hummingbirds. Unusually for a cactus, they aren’t a desert plant, but have adapted to grow on the boughs of tall rainforest trees, festooning their branches with weeping foliage and dazzling flowers. This relatively cool-weather habitat is surprisingly similar to the conditions of our British living rooms, making them perfectly adapted to thrive in hanging baskets or trail over windowsills everywhere. But what does a cactus have to do with Christmas? Not a great deal, really. In fact, in their native habitat their winter-flowering period doesn’t even coincide with Christmas. However, fortunately for gardeners like me, their habit of bursting into the most spectacular of floral displays from November to January occurs just when I need it most.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "input":"The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n As we slide into December, garden centres and supermarkets everywhere are cramming their shelves with Christmas houseplants. Yet from poinsettias to potted Christmas trees, many of these festive favourites can be extremely hard to keep alive in the conditions of the average living room for just a few weeks, let alone year to year. There is, however, a really old-school, and often overlooked, seasonal houseplant that is made from much tougher stuff: the beautiful and exotic Christmas cactus (Schlumbergera truncata and S x buckleyi). These two species (which look so similar that they share a common name) hail from the cool mountains of southeastern Brazil, where they are pollinated by hummingbirds. Unusually for a cactus, they aren’t a desert plant, but have adapted to grow on the boughs of tall rainforest trees, festooning their branches with weeping foliage and dazzling flowers. This relatively cool-weather habitat is surprisingly similar to the conditions of our British living rooms, making them perfectly adapted to thrive in hanging baskets or trail over windowsills everywhere. But what does a cactus have to do with Christmas? Not a great deal, really. In fact, in their native habitat their winter-flowering period doesn’t even coincide with Christmas. However, fortunately for gardeners like me, their habit of bursting into the most spectacular of floral displays from November to January occurs just when I need it most.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

      "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n Boris Johnson and Michael Gove promised Brexit would release an extra £350m a week for the NHS. Now they’ve given the green light to Theresa May to double her offer to settle our obligations to the EU, to a rumoured £40bn. Meanwhile, tomorrow’s budget is likely to confirm that the health service is being starved of funds. But that’s not the end of the story. When the final Brexit bill comes in, it is likely to reach about £80bn – double the prime minister’s latest offer. Not that the government will come clean on this, as it is trying to head off a backlash by Tory backbenchers unhappy that even the £40bn agreed at yesterday’s Brexit cabinet subcommittee is too much. If they realised how much we are going to end up paying, they really would go “bananas” as one MP put it. The government is hoping to defuse opposition from within its own ranks by suggesting the money will come with strings attached: it will be conditional on the EU agreeing a good trade deal or, more realistically, at least agreeing to talk about a future trade deal. May’s new offer could be enough to break the deadlock in the talks at next month’s crucial summit – provided she doesn’t say it’s a “final offer” or add unrealistic conditions to it. After all, the other EU countries have said they will be prepared to move on to talking about our future relationship once “sufficient progress” has been made on the three key divorce issues: money, citizens’ rights and Ireland.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

    "response":"Coach of the Brexit process, Theresa May, has been given permission to increase the amount the UK will pay to the EU for leaving the union, up to £40 billion. This is a higher amount than many expected and is reportedly the result of pressure from the EU. However, some within the UK government are worried that the real cost will be higher than £40 billion, potentially reaching around £80 billion. This is a big worry for some Conservative party members, as they are afraid that paying such a large sum will make the voters think they are not in control. \n\nThe current budget being prepared by the UK government is seen as a soft step to reveal this truth as slowly possible, however, the reality is building up. It can be said that the UK government has been promised by the EU to talk about the future trade deal after they have paid the agreed amount. Currently, the EU is holding out as the UK has not met the pre-requisites set out in the divorce contract. This is like being in a box, unable to move forward without fulfilling the required conditions.\n\nThe change in offer may help the stalled negotiations some day, however it does muster international confidence. But will it change the routine phase we are in? Or is this simply part of the game being played. In simpler terms, the UK government is essentially asking the EU to release them from certain obligations while asking the voters to understand that they don't have a choice in the cost incurred. \n\n \n\nLowering expectations, making excuses for these failures and overtly presenting information by making vague broad promises like they are a doctor trying to inject the gene of justification, however in reality does nothing to show they are transparent about the real state of affairs and the country's economic prospects.\n\n \n\nIn reality, the hardline Brexit supporters who have been promised that their decision would lead to £350m a week being added to the NHS are now expected to quietly drink this bitter dose, despite the promise of millions being put in the box of health.
